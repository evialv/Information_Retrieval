SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim
final rule changing reporting requirements prescribed under the California-Arizona navel and Valencia orange
marketing orders. The marketing orders regulate the handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated
parts of California and are administered locally by the Navel and Valencia Orange Administrative Committees (committees).
This rule modifies language in the orders' rules and regulations to discontinue the use of Form 38 (Weekly Report of
By-Product Oranges) and specify that Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment) only be utilized
for reporting rail car shipments. These actions reduce the burden of information collection requirements under
the marketing orders.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule is issued under Marketing Order Nos. 907 and 908 (7 CFR parts 907 and 908), as amended, regulating the
handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated parts of California, hereinafter referred
to as the ``orders.'' These orders are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended
(7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have
retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present
an irreconcilable conflict with this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and
request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing
on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court
of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules
issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting
on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are approximately 140 handlers of navel oranges and 125 handlers of Valencia oranges who are subject to regulation
under the respective marketing order and approximately 3,750 producers of navel oranges and 3,700 producers of Valencia
oranges in the regulated areas. In addition, there are about 35 by-product manufacturers that will be affected by
this rule. Small agricultural service firms, which includes handlers and by-product manufacturers, have been defined
by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000, and
small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers,
producers, and processors of California-Arizona navel and Valencia oranges may be classified as small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action finalizes changes in the reporting requirements prescribed under the California-Arizona orange marketing
orders. This rule modifies language in the orders' rules and regulations to discontinue the use of Form 38 (Weekly
Report of By-Product Oranges) and specify that Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment) only
be utilized for reporting rail car shipments. These changes were unanimously recommended by the committees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim final rule was issued on October 8, 1993, and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 53112, October 14, 1993), with an effective date of October 14, 1993. That rule amended &sect;&sect;907.131,
907.141, 908.131, and 908.141 of the rules and regulations in effect under the orders. That rule provided a 30-day
comment period which ended November 15, 1993. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 907.67 and 908.67 of the navel and Valencia orange marketing orders provide authority for the exemption
from order regulation the handling of oranges to commercial processors for processing into products, including
juice. Sections 907.131 and 908.131 of the orders' rules and regulations prescribe procedures governing the exemption
from order regulation of such by-product oranges. Included in these procedures are certain reporting requirements
imposed on handlers and by-product manufacturers to help ensure that order requirements and regulations governing
the exemption for by-product oranges are being followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, persons who wish to acquire oranges as an approved by-products manufacturer for commercial processing
into by-products exempt from regulation must submit an application to the committee on Form 14 (Application to be
Placed on Approved List of Orange By-Product Manufacturers). These applications are referred to the committees'
compliance department for investigation and then, if appropriate, referred to the committees for approval to be
placed on an approved list of by-product manufacturers. Commercial processors are also required to submit to the
committees copies of Form 15 (Orange Diversion Report) which specify how the oranges were disposed. Finally, approved
by-product manufacturers were required to submit Form 38 (Weekly Report of By-Product Oranges) during the crop year
when processing is occurring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The committees have recommended that submission of Form 38 no longer be required under the marketing orders. Submission
of Form 38 was added to the orders' rules and regulations in 1990 because the committees believed that the additional
information would help to ensure that oranges exempted under the by-products exemption did not enter the fresh fruit
market. It was believed that comparisons of the total amount of oranges received by processors with the total amount
of by-products manufactured would give the committees a method to verify that all oranges received were manufactured
into by-products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the committees have found that the information collected on Form 38 is not necessary to ensure compliance
with order requirements. In addition, much of the information on Form 38 is collected on other reports required to
be submitted under the orders. The committees believe that submission of Form 38 creates an additional burden on by-product
manufacturers that is not necessary. Thus, the committees recommended revising the orders' rules and regulations
to discontinue the use of Form 38. The Department has also made some minor modifications to &sect;907.131 and 908.131
for the purpose of clarity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second change that the committees recommended concerns Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment).
Sections 907.71 and 908.71 of the orange marketing orders provide that handlers furnish to the committees information
regarding cartons of oranges handled, segregated by size, within 24 hours of shipment. Handlers must also indicate
whether the shipments were destined to points in the U.S. and Alaska or Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 907.141 and 908.141 of the orders' rules and regulations require handlers to submit, on Form 3, a manifest
report of oranges shipped within a 24 hour period. Prior to the effective date of the interim final rule, handlers were
required to include both truck and rail car shipments on Form 3. However, identical information regarding truck shipments
is submitted by handlers on Form 8 (Certificate of Assignment of Allotment). According to the committees, this duplication
of information created an added burden for handlers and was not necessary. Thus, the committees recommended modifying
the orders' rules and regulations to require that handlers only report rail car shipments on Form 3. Handlers are still
required to submit rail manifests and other appropriate documentation to the committees to substantiate rail car
shipments.

The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by
the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB numbers
0581&hyph;0116 for navel oranges and 0581&hyph;0121 for Valencia oranges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule reduces the reporting burden on approximately 25 processors of navel and Valencia oranges who had been completing
Form 38, taking about 0.33 hour to complete each report. This rule also reduces the reporting burden on approximately
210 handlers who ship primarily by truck, taking about 0.40 hour to complete each report. About 80 handlers who ship
by rail at some point during a season will continue to use Form 3, taking approximately 0.20 hour to complete the report.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of all relevant material presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees,
and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') has adopted amendments to Form F&hyph;9 under the multijurisdictional
disclosure system (``MJDS'') for Canadian issuers which will recognize investment grade ratings by securities
rating organizations recognized by Canadian securities regulators for purposes of filings on Forms F&hyph;9 and
40&hyph;F. These amendments have been adopted in light of the Commission's experience with the MJDS and should further
facilitate transnational capital formation. They are being made effective in light of the adoption by Canadian securities
regulators of parallel amendments to the MJDS in Canada for U.S. issuers.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This order rules on requests for rehearing of the Commission's order on remand issued following the decision of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit which upheld in substantial part the Commission's final rule governing
the relationship between interstate natural gas pipelines and their marketing or brokering affiliates. The order
on remand, among other things, narrowed the scope of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement by pipelines with
respect to sales and marketing information and extended the sunset date of the final rule's reporting requirements.
The order on rehearing, among other things, deletes the remaining categories of gas sales and marketing information
from the contemporaneous disclosure requirement and further extends the sunset date.

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 4, 1992, the Commission issued Order No. 497&hyph;D
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in response to the opinion issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tenneco Gas 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Tenneco)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which upheld in substantial part Order Nos. 497 and 497&hyph;A,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission's final rule governing the relationship between interstate natural gas pipelines and their marketing
or brokering affiliates. However, the court found that the Commission did not adequately justify its extension of
the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of &sect;161.3(f)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the Commission's regulations to gas sales and marketing information. Further, in its review of Ozark Gas Transmission
System (Ozark),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a consolidated case, the court found that, based upon the evidence in the record, the Commission erred in finding Order
No. 497 applicable to Ozark Gas Transmission System (Ozark), a joint venture. Accordingly, the court remanded the
proceeding to the Commission. In response to the court's remand, the Commission issued Order No. 497&hyph;D which
revised &sect;161.3(f) to narrow the scope of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement with respect to sales
and marketing information, and found that Ozark is subject to the requirements of Order No. 497. In addition, Order
No. 497&hyph;D extended the sunset date of Order No. 497's reporting requirements from December 31, 1992, until December
31, 1993. However, the order stated that 90 days after the Commission has determined that an individual pipeline is
in full compliance with Order No. 636,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the pipeline would not be required to submit the affiliated transportation log (FERC Form No. 592) to the Commission.
The order stated that the pipeline must continue to maintain and provide its affiliated transportation log information
on its electronic bulletin board (EBB).

II. Public Reporting Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The public reporting burden under FERC&hyph;592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines, as revised by Order
Nos. 497&hyph;D and 636, is expected to remain unchanged. Currently, the reporting burden is estimated to average
9.94 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering
and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Annual reporting requirements
under FERC&hyph;592 are expected to total 7,882 hours, based on an estimated 793 responses from approximately 61
respondents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issued concurrently with this order is a NOPR in Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;000.

 The NOPR proposes to significantly reduce the FERC&hyph;592 information reporting requirements and burden. Extending
the sunset date for FERC&hyph;592 through June 30, 1994, will give interested parties and the Commission time to evaluate
the NOPR comments and allow the Commission time to prepare a final rule.

III. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 21, 1992, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued its opinion in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tenneco,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 upholding in substantial part Order Nos. 497 and 497&hyph;A. However, the court found that the Commission did not
adequately justify its extension of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of &sect;161.3(f) to gas sales
and marketing information. The court stated that ``[o]n remand the Commission should reconsider its justification
for applying [the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of &sect;161.3(f)] to sales and marketing information
and ensure that the final requirement is reasonably tailored to meet the Commission's goals of improving the market
and benefitting consumers, as well as preventing undue discrimination.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In a related matter, the court stated that ``[a]pplying [the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of &sect;161.3(f)]
to released-gas information prior to the issuance of Order No. 497&hyph;A might well be fundamentally unfair'' and
that the Commission could avoid ``the expense of litigation over this issue by announcing that it will not retroactively
apply [&sect;161.3(f)] to released gas information.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Further, in its review of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ozark,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the court found that the Commission erred in finding Order No. 497 applicable to Ozark, a joint venture partnership
composed of subsidiaries of four natural gas pipelines, each of which has a 25 percent ownership and voting interest.
The court stated that the Commission failed to consider relevant evidence regarding the ability of the owner pipelines
with affiliates to control the partnership.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 4, 1992, in response to the court's opinion in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tenneco,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission issued Order No. 497&hyph;D, an order on remand and extending sunset date. Based upon the court's opinion,
and in light of the structural changes in the gas industry that were to occur as a result of Order No. 636, the Commission
revised &sect;161.3(f) to narrow the scope of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement with respect to sales
and marketing information. Under revised standard (f), pipelines are still required to contemporaneously disclose
information related to transportation of natural gas. However, with respect to information related to gas sales
or marketing, pipelines are only required to disclose information relating to sales or marketing on its system or
the system of an affiliated pipeline. There are two categories of gas sales or marketing information that are not required
to be contemporaneously disclosed: (1) Gas sales or marketing information that is available from public sources
and (2) information related to gas sales off a pipeline's system, but not involving the system of an affiliated pipeline.
Section 161.3(f) now reads:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To the extent [a pipeline] provides to a marketing affiliate information related to transportation of natural gas,
or information related to gas sales or gas marketing on its system or the system of an affiliated pipeline, it must provide
that information contemporaneously to all potential shippers, affiliated and nonaffiliated, on its system. Pipelines
are not required to contemporaneously disclose: (1) Gas sales or gas marketing information that is available from
public sources and (2) Information related to gas sales or gas marketing off a pipeline's system, but not involving
the system of an affiliated pipeline.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In a related matter, based upon the court's advice, the Commission stated that it will not retroactively apply the
contemporaneous disclosure requirement of standard (f) to released gas information, that is, standard (f)'s application
to released gas information would begin with the issuance of Order No. 497&hyph;A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the issue of Order No. 497's applicability to Ozark, the Commission found that despite the fact that
there is a unanimous approval provision in the Ozark partnership agreement, the two partners that have parent companies
with marketing affiliates shipping on Ozark's line can still exercise ``control'' as defined by &sect;161.2 of the
Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission found that even with a unanimous approval provision in the partnership agreement, Ozark Pipeline
Company and Tennessee Ozark Gas Company, the two partners whose parent companies have marketing affiliates, can
each act alone to direct or effect the management or policies of Ozark Gas Transmission System. The Commission stated
that since there is a unanimous approval requirement, each partner has veto power over any decision by simply withholding
its vote. The Commission stated that such power could be exercised in a manner that could unduly prefer the marketing
affiliates related to Ozark's partners, for example, by either or both partners refusing to engage in an action that
would benefit an independent marketer in competition with one of Ozark's partners' affiliates. The Commission stated
that it believed that control can be exercised in a negative manner, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by withholding approval of a specific policy or transaction, as well as in an affirmative manner, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by actually approving a decision that would unduly prefer a marketing affiliate.

Finally, the Commission extended the sunset date of Order No. 497's reporting requirements from December 31, 1992,
until December 31, 1993, because of the important role they will play in the regulatory structure created by Order
No. 636. The Commission stated that although Order No. 636 does not change the requirements governing the relationship
between pipelines and their marketing affiliates, the structural changes engendered by full compliance with the
rule would remove the need to continue filing the affiliated transportation log (FERC Form No. 592) with the Commission.
The Commission stated that Order No. 636's Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) requirements ensure certain minimum
standards for maintaining and communicating information about a pipeline's available capacity, current capacity
release offers, and affiliate marketing-related information. The order stated that unless further case-specific
action is taken by the Commission, 90 days after the Commission has determined that a pipeline is in full compliance
with the requirements of Order No. 636, that pipeline will not be required to submit Form 592 to the Commission. The
order further stated that the pipeline must continue to maintain and to provide its affiliated transportation log
information on its EBB. Finally, the order stated, in practice, this means that pipelines remain subject to the standards
of conduct and will continue to maintain the information mandated by Order Nos. 497 and 636, but will not be required
to file Form 592 with the Commission.

1. Requests for Rehearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of pipelines (National Fuel, INGAA, ANR, CIG, Tenneco, CNG, and Northwest) and the Joint Parties assert that
the Commission should eliminate from &sect;161.3(f) the requirement that sales and marketing information given
to a marketing affiliate must be contemporaneously disclosed to all potential shippers because it is inconsistent
with the court's decision in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tenneco.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pipelines and the Joint Parties contend that the revised standard provides a limited exclusion for sales and marketing
information that is available from public sources or is related to off-system sales or marketing transactions not
involving the system of an affiliated pipeline but there is no explanation in Order No. 497&hyph;D as to how so limited
an exclusion can be interpreted as responsive to the court's remand. The pipelines and Joint Parties argue that the
Commission's assumption that pipelines obtain sales and marketing information in connection with or when combined
with transportation is not responsive to the court's directive to provide an independent justification for barring
the exchange of sales or marketing information that is wholly unrelated to transportation information. The pipelines
and the Joint Parties submit that Order No. 497&hyph;D evidences neither the independent justification required
by the court, nor a consideration of the action on remand which was suggested by the court. The pipelines and the Joint
Parties assert that the Commission has not examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation
for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made. They argue that the result
is an arbitrary and capricious order which is unsupported by substantial evidence.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The pipelines and the Joint Parties contend that Order No. 497&hyph;D is inconsistent with Order No. 636. They assert
that the Commission has unequivocally found in Order No. 636 that sales services are competitive and has set in motion
a restructuring of the pipeline industry that is intended to result in competition for sales on an even basis by producers,
pipelines, and marketers. The pipelines and the Joint Parties submit that Order No. 497&hyph;D is at odds with Order
No. 636 in its assumption (which is unsupported by record evidence) that pipelines possess sales and marketing information
which flows from the pipelines' anticompetitive market power. They state that, as the Commission documented in Order
No. 636, most pipeline industry market power has already been eliminated, and some individual companies have completed
the transition to competitiveness by unbundling. They further state that to remove the last vestiges of pipeline
market power, as the Commission sees it in Order No. 636, an industry-wide unbundling is to be in place by the start of
the 1993&hyph;94 heating season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that in light of unbundling under Order No. 636, it is inexplicable how the
Commission could see a need to re-promulgate standard (f) with regard to sales and marketing information. They state
that when Order No. 497 was issued, prior to unbundling, the Commission's intent was to prevent preferential treatment
of an affiliated marketer by an interstate pipeline in the provision of transportation services. The pipelines and
the Joint Parties state that, as recognized by the Commission, pipelines have no monopoly power over sales. They assert
that it is only a pipeline's transportation function which even arguably puts it in a position of being able to favor
its own marketing affiliates. Consequently, they argue that the standards of conduct under Order No. 497 should only
apply to pipeline transportation information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pipelines and the Joint Parties contend that the new contemporaneous disclosure requirement in Order No. 497&hyph;D
imposes unnecessary and unreasonable burdens upon pipelines. They state that, as Chair Moler noted in her dissent
to Order No. 497&hyph;D, the standards of conduct under Order No. 497 already preclude pipelines from disclosing
to marketing affiliates any information obtained from non-affiliated shippers, or otherwise giving any advantages
or preferences to their marketing affiliates in the provision of transportation service. The pipelines and the Joint
Parties assert that these requirements effectively prevent pipelines from using any remaining market power they
have over transportation services to benefit their marketing affiliates, and make the Order No. 497&hyph;D disclosure
requirements unnecessary. The pipelines and the Joint Parties do not believe that in light of all of the current competition
in the natural gas industry, pipelines have significant market power over transportation service. However, to the
extent there is any remaining market power over transportation service, the pipelines and the Joint Parties argue
that the Order No. 497 standards of conduct adequately address this issue without a need for the contemporaneous disclosure
requirement for sales and marketing information. They submit that the Commission's imposition of the Order No. 497&hyph;D
contemporaneous disclosure requirement only serves to benefit pipeline competitors, and imposes unnecessary
burdens on pipelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pipelines and the Joint Parties argue that the Commission cites no evidence to support its critical conclusion
that the sales and marketing information that a pipeline derives from its ongoing relationship with its customers
is a product of either past or present anticompetitive market power. They assert that the Commission's error on this
point is exacerbated by its lack of jurisdiction to regulate the disclosure of sales or marketing information at all.
The pipelines and Joint Parties state, as the court noted, because the Commission is authorized to regulate only those
practices that are unduly discriminatory or preferential, the Commission appears to lack the authority to prevent
pipelines from preferring their affiliates with exclusive access to sales or marketing information unless that
sort of preference is undue. The pipelines and Joint Parties contend that the Commission cannot resolve questions
about the very existence of its authority based on nothing more than its sense that the informational advantages that
a gas marketer derives from an affiliated pipeline result from anticompetitive market power rather than the economic
efficiencies of vertical integration. The pipelines and the Joint Parties submit that the contemporaneous disclosure
requirement also exceeds the Commission's lawful authority because the Commission is only empowered to act with
respect to any transportation or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. They state that
the contemporaneous disclosure requirement apparently applies to the sharing of information regardless of whether
a jurisdictional service is being performed. The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that there is plainly no lawful
basis for the Commission to extend its regulation to non-jurisdictional services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pipelines and the Joint Parties argue that even assuming that the pipeline generates certain sales and marketing
information that is not publicly available, mere sharing of this information with an affiliate does not translate
into a transportation advantage for an affiliate, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
even if the pipeline informs an affiliate of a potential sales market, that does not mean that the pipeline can automatically
provide the affiliate with the transportation capacity necessary to complete the deal. Indeed, they assert that
the affording of such a preference is precluded under &sect;161.3(c) which states that a pipeline may not give its
marketing affiliate preference over nonaffiliated customers in matters relating to part 284 transportation, including,
but not limited to, scheduling, balancing, transportation, storage, or curtailment priority. The pipelines and
the Joint Parties contend that all the Commission's contemporaneous disclosure requirement does is to limit the
flow of information in the market in a manner which hinders competition and serves no legitimate purpose.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that with the issuance of Order No. 636, and the restructuring of all interstate
pipelines, pipelines will no longer retain any transportation capacity. They state that Order No. 636 prohibits
a pipeline from retaining or obtaining capacity downstream of the point of unbundling on its system except for storage
needed for system management and balancing for no-notice service, and thus all capacity will be allocated to the pipeline's
shippers. The pipelines and the Joint Parties state that with all of the pipeline's capacity in the hands of its shippers,
the pipeline will have no control over when the capacity will become available. They state that availability will
depend, to a large degree, on its release by firm shipper through the pipeline's capacity release program. Moreover,
they state when the capacity does become available (either through the release program or as interruptible transportation),
the pipeline will have no control over who will get the capacity. They state that the decision will be solely determined
by price paid and other objective criteria as specified by the releasing shipper and/or in the pipeline's tariff.
The pipelines and the Joint Parties submit that even if a pipeline knew of a particular gas supply and a demand for gas
in a particular location and proceeded to pass that information on to its affiliate, no preferential treatment with
respect to the provision of transportation services could result. The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that
as Order No. 636 has dispelled the potential for a pipeline to grant an undue preference with respect to transportation
services (the purported reason behind Order No. 497), the Commission's newly revised contemporaneous disclosure
requirement constitutes nothing more than an arbitrary prohibition against the normal interactions between affiliates,
in a manner which places pipeline marketing affiliates at an unjustified disadvantage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Northwest requests that the Commission clarify that it will not apply standard (f) to any conduct regarding sales
or marketing information prior to the effective date of Order No. 497&hyph;D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tenneco requests that the Commission clarify that the contemporaneous disclosure requirement for information
regarding on-system sales and marketing information conveyed by the pipeline to its marketing affiliate applies
only to the transmission of information by the transportation personnel of the pipeline and not to transmission of
information by the unbundled merchant personnel of the pipeline. Tenneco believes that such a clarification is reasonable
because in the post-Order No. 636 environment the unbundled merchant will be the functional equivalent of a marketing
affiliate because it will not have market power over the sale of natural gas. Further, the pipeline merchant personnel
will be required to operate under the exact same restraints with respect to the pipeline transportation personnel
that marketing affiliate personnel are required to abide by.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tenneco, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the court found that ``the contemporaneous disclosure requirement_at least as it affects information regarding
transportation, where pipelines have monopolistic market power_reflects a reasonable effort to promote a competitive
market without significantly harming existing efficiencies.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, with respect to the contemporaneous disclosure of gas sales and marketing information, the court stated
that based on the record it was ``unable to conclude that standard (f)'s application to sales and marketing is justified;
nor can we be confident that FERC possessed the statutory authority to regulate the transfer of sales and marketing
information from pipelines to their affiliates.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The court remanded the proceeding to the Commission and stated that ``[o]n remand, the Commission should consider
its justification for applying standard (f) to sales and marketing information and ensure that the final requirement
is reasonably tailored to meet the Commission's goals of improving the market and benefitting consumers, as well
as preventing undue discrimination.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Upon further review of the issues raised with respect to the disclosure of certain categories of sales and marketing
information and in light of the court's findings, the substantive protection of other standards of conduct (particularly
standard(e)),
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 structural changes in the industry, and the restructuring mandated by Order No. 636, the Commission will delete from
the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of standard (f) the remaining categories of gas sales and marketing
information. Pipelines with marketing affiliates will only be required to contemporaneously disclose information
related to the transportation of natural gas. The Commission now believes that to impose a general requirement of
contemporaneous disclosure of non-transportation information could have a chilling effect on pipelines marketing
their gas and does not with any degree of certainty improve the market nor benefit consumers. But while we are limiting
the reach of standard (f), pipelines are not relieved of their obligations to refrain from unduly discriminatory
conduct that is prohibited under the Natural Gas Act or the Natural Gas Policy Act, whether or not that conduct is covered
by standard (f) or any of the other standards. Moreover, while the Commission does not choose to continue a standard
requiring contemporaneous disclosure of certain categories of sales and marketing information at this time, this
does not bar the Commission from examining such questions, if relevant and necessary, in specific cases.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Historically, the pipeline collected and maintained extensive data on natural gas supply and markets. As the primary_if
not exclusive_buyer and seller of natural gas, pipelines had all of the data on production, consumption and markets
for the areas they served. However, pipelines today are not the dominant sellers of natural gas they were a decade ago.
About 80 percent of the natural gas pipelines deliver today is shipper-owned gas. Indeed, after the Order No. 636-mandated
restructuring process is complete, nearly 100 percent of natural gas deliveries will be shipper-owned gas. Also,
other structural changes in the industry further weaken the pipeline's knowledge base. Increasingly, contract
pricing relies on nationwide competitive and financial market determinations, such as the NYMEX futures market,
and published spot prices. Also, Order No. 636 establishes a short-term capacity release program for transactions
less than 30 days in duration where even the EBB bidding requirements are waived. Pipelines will be afforded substantially
less information about these types of transactions than traditionally required. For these transactions pipelines
know where the gas is entering their system, and where it is redelivered, but may know nothing about the extent of reserves,
the producers' or consumers' circumstances, or the commercial terms of the sale itself. Often the pipeline does not
even know the identity of the ultimate consumer. Indeed the theory underlying Order No. 636 is that shippers would
have more access to producers and marketers to make their decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
But just as important is the fact that other shippers and producers will know where gas is entering and being redelivered
throughout the system. Order No. 636 requires that this type of information be provided during the restructuring
process, and through the EBB posting requirement required during the right-of-first-refusal, and capacity release
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent that a pipeline collects sales and marketing information from public sources, or from sources outside
its transportation role, release of this information to its marketing affiliate generally does not in any way relate
to the pipeline's monopoly power over transportation. Unnecessary interference with communications between a
pipeline and its marketing affiliates would actually reduce competition, by inhibiting one segment of the industry
from vigorously competing with other natural gas sellers. To do otherwise would create an unlevel playing field tilted
against pipeline merchant service units or marketing affiliates and towards producers, nonaffiliated marketers,
local distribution companies (LDCs), and others. Rather than a balanced approach, this tilted playing field would
give an unfair advantage to non-pipeline merchants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pipeline obtains sales and marketing information from the public domain, its bundled merchant function or its
transportation activities. The public domain information should not trigger standard (f), following the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tenneco
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 court's reasoning. The bundled merchant information is outdated and does not meet the current information standard
mentioned by the court. And finally, the transportation-generated sales and marketing information cannot be shared
with the affiliate in the first instance given the standard (e) prohibition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The only sales and marketing information which could result from a pipeline abusing its monopoly transportation
position by sharing with a marketing affiliate would come from nonaffiliated shippers or potential shippers. Since
standard (e) prohibits the pipeline from sharing any information derived from those sources with its marketing affiliate,
the act of sharing such sales and marketing information both violates standard (e) and triggers the requirement to
comply with standard (f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standards (f) and (e) are compatible with respect to transportation information_pipelines could generate and communicate
transportation information to their marketing affiliates without violating standard (e). For example, as a result
of its own engineering flow analysis, a pipeline could develop information concerning capacity availability. If
that information is shared with a marketing affiliate, standard (f) is triggered. But since the information was not
obtained by the pipeline from a nonaffiliated shipper or potential shipper, standard (e) is not violated.

While these reasons themselves compel modification of standard (f), further changes in the industry structure,
and in pipelines' operations mandated by Order No. 636 provide additional support. Order No. 636 will both level the
playing field for all competitors, and increase the amount of capacity information available from EBBS to all potential
shippers_marketing affiliates and all other sellers, marketers, transporters and consumers alike. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, Order No. 636 requires pipelines to unbundle their own sales from the transportation service. To do this each
pipeline is required to establish separate operating staffs for pipeline (transportation) operations and merchant
operations (merchant function operating unit). Each pipeline is also required to treat its merchant function operating
unit as if it were a marketing affiliate, for purposes of compliance with the standards of conduct and reporting requirements
of Order No. 497, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In practice, many pipelines are establishing separate affiliates to provide the merchant services required by Order
No. 636. This change should further reduce the likelihood that a pipeline would even have sales or marketing information
to pass along to its marketing affiliate (or merchant function operating unit). Indeed, whatever sales and marketing
information a pipeline would have developed from public sources would, for the most part, be available to all other
competitors on a similar basis.

This represents a significant change from past practices. When pipelines were the primary merchants in the interstate
marketplace, merchant services were provided under long-term contracts on an ``on demand'' basis. While the pipelines
had all of the industry's information available to them, and operational control over all of the functions, this information
was aggregated over both time (monthly) and markets. Increasingly, today's merchant services focus on individual
customers and are adjustable on a daily or even hourly basis. The information needed to drive the old-style merchant
services is neither compatible with nor sufficient to meet the demands of today's marketplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, all future sales of gas will take place at pipeline receipt or pooling points. This requires that the pipeline,
acting as a merchant, and the pipeline's marketing affiliates must sell gas at the same point on the system as other
gas sellers. This places all other natural gas sellers on a level playing field with marketing affiliates and the pipeline
as a merchant. And because the Commission has mandated that pipelines allow all shippers flexible receipt, pooling,
and delivery point authority, all shippers should have equal access to available capacity throughout the system.
The designation of pooling points, the pipeline's point of sale for merchant services, and the terms and conditions
governing flexible point authority are all subject to negotiations among the pipeline and the parties in individual
restructuring proceedings_not subject to the pipeline's sole discretion to decide. The result of negotiations
over these significant operating terms and conditions must ultimately be filed by the pipelines as part of their FERC
tariffs and apply equitably to all shippers whether they purchase from the pipeline or anyone else. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, pipelines are encouraged in the Order No. 636 restructuring process to minimize transition costs by assigning_on
a voluntary non-discriminatory basis_gas supply contracts to their former sales customers. Pipelines are also
allowed 100 percent recovery of transition costs. These transition provisions are designed to fairly distribute
the burden of the historic legacy of uncompetitive pipeline purchase arrangements. Coupled with removal of burdensome
regulatory pricing structures, pipeline merchant function operating units should be left in a position to compete
fairly with other merchants without being saddled with the costs of uncompetitive purchase contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, Order No. 636 requires pipelines to establish and maintain EBBs and requires that EBB personnel function
independently of the gas marketing personnel to the maximum extent practicable. Identification of some of the data
to be maintained on the EBB is the subject of negotiation between the pipeline and the parties to the restructuring
proceedings. However, other data are required by Order No. 636 to be on the EBB at all times, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
length of release, rate, quantity, criteria for bid evaluation (which criteria was determined during the restructuring
proceeding) and the pipeline must identify all capacity on its system which is available directly from the pipeline.
Implementation of these EBBs will give all shippers and potential shippers instant access to the most current information
about the availability of pipeline capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Order No. 636 creates a capacity releasing program. Under this program, firm shippers of the pipeline are
allowed to resell their capacity, in whole or in part, and under terms and conditions they choose, to the highest bidding
replacement shipper. Releasing shippers are also allowed to include specific provisions for the recall of released
capacity, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
when temperatures drop below a pre-set minimum level. Releases may be either permanent or temporary, firm or interruptible.
Coupled with flexible receipt and delivery point authority, the capacity release program will allow existing firm
shippers to sell their capacity in the pipeline to others. This will create competition for capacity against the pipeline
itself. Although the pipeline would continue to operate the system, it would no longer be in sole control over who has
access to capacity. Again, the pipelines and their shippers are expected to work together in implementing the Order
No. 636 restructuring process to decide how the pipeline will operate in the new unbundled world.

Tenneco's request that the Commission clarify that the contemporaneous disclosure requirement for information
regarding on-system sales and marketing information conveyed by the pipeline to its marketing affiliate applies
only to the transmission of information by the transportation personnel of the pipeline and not to transmission of
information by the unbundled merchant personnel of the pipeline is moot. The Commission notes, however, that standard
(f), in any form, applies only to the pipeline in its relationship with its marketing affiliate, and now, because of
Order No. 636, its unbundled merchant division is the functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate.

The Indicated Parties assert that the Commission erred in permitting interstate pipelines to cease to submit the
affiliated transportation log (Form 592) 90 days after the Commission has determined that an individual pipeline
is in full compliance with Order No. 636. The Indicated Parties submit that the information available on Form 592 may
be more essential after a pipeline complies fully with Order No. 636 than it is now. The Indicated Parties state that
following full compliance with Order No. 636, an interstate pipeline will be permitted to sell natural gas at negotiated
prices. In this environment, the Indicated Parties argue that such a pipeline may be motivated to favor its own sales
of gas as well as sales made by its marketing affiliates. For example, the Indicated Parties contend that to obtain
a sale at the expense of other sellers, a pipeline could sell its gas at a loss or a very low price, but charge the full transportation
rate. The Indicated Parties assert that this would allow the pipeline to avoid the correlative discount rule under
&sect;161.3(i), and charge all other sellers the maximum transportation rate rather than discounting to obtain
the transportation business. The Indicated Parties argue that to remain competitive, non-affiliated sellers would
be forced to reduce their gas prices below what they would charge if the pipeline discounted its transportation rates
rather than the price at which the pipeline merchant function sells its gas. The Indicated Parties contend that the
non-affiliated sellers would suffer a loss because they would be forced to sell their gas at a loss and pay the full transportation
rate. The Indicated Parties assert that the pipeline, however, would not suffer the same economic detriment because
it would receive the full transportation rate on the movement of its gas. The Indicated Parties submit that they and
other competing merchants will be unable to monitor and detect such favoritism without the information provided
on Form 592. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Indicated Parties assert that the difficulty with the elimination of the filing of Form 592 is that the Commission
and the industry have no experience with the operation of EBBs by a pipeline in full compliance with Order No. 636. The
Indicated Parties argue that the Commission cannot find that the EBBs will prove to be a reliable and accurate source
of the information now supplied on Form 592. The Indicated Parties state that in light of this practical experience,
the Commission recently requested comments on the configuration and operation of EBBs in Docket No. RM93&hyph;4&hyph;000.
The Indicated Parties state that in the list of questions on which comments were requested the Commission asked whether
``any of this information [available on the EBBs can] be used to fulfill existing FERC reporting requirements?''
The Indicated Parties contend that this request demonstrates that the EBBs are an unproven means of communicating
the information now available on Form 592. The Indicated Parties state that even though it had requested comments
on whether it could eliminate any of its current reporting requirements, the Commission, without even waiting for
an answer to its question, erroneously assumed in Order No. 497&hyph;D that the answer would be ``yes'' and eliminated
one of its reporting requirements. The Indicated Parties submit that the disparity between the requests for comments
and the elimination of a reporting requirement in Order No. 497&hyph;D demonstrates that the Commission acted in
an arbitrary and capricious manner without substantial evidence in eliminating the filing of Form 592. The Indicated
Parties assert that the Commission has failed to protect the public interest with its elimination of the requirement
that pipelines file Form 592. The Indicated Parties argue that the Commission should grant rehearing and reinstate
the requirement that pipelines file Form 592. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hadson also asserts that the Commission erred in eliminating the filing of Form 592. Hadson states that under Order
No. 636 pipelines will be able to conduct an essentially deregulated gas merchant business under the pipeline's corporate
entity and while sharing key personnel. Hadson contends that this arrangement, which it does not oppose in and of itself,
nonetheless creates additional opportunities for the pipeline-transporter to favor both its own merchant division
as well as its affiliates and that this increases rather than diminishes the need for public scrutiny. Hadson argues
that, at a minimum, deregulating the pipeline-merchant can certainly not be invoked as grounds for a decrease in the
need for public monitoring by the industry watchdog. Finally, Hadson notes that even requiring the same information
to be disclosed on an EBB is materially different from requiring the information to be filed with the Commission under
the Natural Gas Act since filings with the Commission are subject to 18 U.S.C. 1001 while postings on an EBB are probably
not.

Tenneco asserts that while the Commission recognized in Order No. 497&hyph;D that the EBB requirements in Order No.
636 obviate the need for pipelines to file Form 592 with the Commission, the Commission failed to recognize that certain
information currently required in Form 592 will have little use to anyone in the post-Order No. 636 world. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tenneco states that Item Nos. 7 and 8 require that a pipeline report the position of its marketing affiliate in the pipeline's
transportation queue and the total number of requests in the queue respectively. Tenneco submits that in the unbundled
world pipelines will allocate available capacity among requesting shippers not on a first-come, first-served basis,
but on the basis of the relative value of the request to the pipeline. Tenneco states that the value of the requests for
transportation will involve a calculation based on the price offered and the term of the request, and the precise method
of determining which offer has the highest value to the pipeline will be stated in the pipeline's tariff. Tenneco asserts
that without a first-come, first-served queue in effect, there is no advantage to be gained by maintaining these two
information requirements. Tenneco further asserts that the pipeline capacity release programs will provide yet
another avenue through which shippers desiring firm transportation capacity can obtain it, thus further reducing
the utility of the required information. Tenneco contends that these changes brought about by Order No. 636 will thus
eliminate the need for pipelines to report the queue position of their marketing affiliates and the total number of
requests in the queue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tenneco states that Item Nos. 23 and 24 require pipelines to report whether or not the pipeline will receive take-or-pay
credits for transporting an affiliate's gas and what percentage of the gas transported will be subject to credit.
Tenneco states that because the Commission's take-or-pay crediting program terminated on December 31, 1990, pipelines
have not been able to receive take-or-pay credits since December 31, 1990. Therefore, Tenneco asserts that maintaining
this requirement serves no purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tenneco states that Item No. 32 requires pipelines to identify the location of the producing fields from which gas
requested to be transported for an affiliate originates. Tenneco argues that with the implementation of flexible
receipt and delivery points and capacity release, this information becomes useless. Tenneco contends that shippers
will be using secondary receipt points on their own contracts and acquiring each other's capacity much more than they
have historically. Tenneco asserts that this is precisely the outcome that the Commission is trying to bring about
by mandating flexible receipt and delivery points and capacity release. Tenneco submits that with this increase
in the number of transportation transactions that involve the use of points other than the primary receipt or delivery
point of the entity requesting transportation, requiring pipelines to report this information serves no purpose.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tenneco states that Record No. 3 requires pipelines to report requested receipt and delivery points for transportation
requests of their marketing affiliates. Tenneco asserts that the advent of flexible receipt and delivery points
renders this information useless. Tenneco argues that the marketing affiliate, like any other shipper, will have
the firm right to use any receipt or delivery point on the system to the extent that capacity is available. Thus, Tenneco
contends the utility of maintaining a list of requested receipt and delivery points is vastly diminished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the information required by Item Nos. 7, 8, 23, 24, and 32 of Schedule 2 and all of Schedule 3 will no longer have
value after full compliance with Order No. 636, Tenneco requests that the Commission clarify that this information
need not be maintained on pipelines' EBBs. Tenneco asserts that eliminating the requirement to report it is consistent
with the Commission's goal to decrease needlessly burdensome regulation. Tenneco requests expedited action on
this issue as pipelines are currently setting up their EBBs, and a swift affirmative response will enable the new EBBs
to more accurately reflect the required information.

2. Commission Ruling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission denies the Indicated Parties' and Hadson's requests for rehearing. Their arguments lose sight of
the fact that the Form 592 information must still be provided electronically, thus allowing interested parties and
the Commission staff to monitor the activities of pipelines and their affiliates and to initiate the appropriate
action when evidence of discrimination in favor of affiliates exists. The Indicated Parties' concerns about obtaining
reliable and accurate Form 592 information are unfounded. Section 250.16(g)(2) states that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An interstate pipeline must provide 24-hour access, by electronic means, to the data specified in paragraph (b)(2)
of this section. Access to the information must be provided once the service has begun. A pipeline must, on a daily basis,
either update the information or indicate that no changes have occurred in the log information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most pipelines satisfied this requirement through the use of EBBs in the past, and Order No. 636 now mandates EBBs.
Interested parties have been receiving and will continue to receive the Form 592 information electronically. Thus,
the Indicated Parties' argument that the Commission and the industry have no experience with EBBs is inaccurate.
Moreover, the requirements of Order No. 636 ensure that each pipeline's Order No. 497 EBB must provide for: (a) Downloading
by users; (b) daily back-up of information, which must be available for at least three years; (c) purging information
on completed transactions from current files; (d) display of most recent entries ahead of information posted earlier;
and (e) on-line help, a search function and a menu that permits users to separately access records in the transportation
log and standards of conduct information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 These features allow shippers to take the information that is currently filed on Form 592s off the pipelines' EBBs
and obtain access to the information up to three years after it is posted.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
23
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In these circumstances, the burden on the pipelines from filing Form 592s and the administrative burden on the Commission
from collecting them outweighs any benefits of collecting the data in hard copy.

The Commission also does not believe that Hadson's argument relying on 18 U.S.C. 1001 is a valid reason for maintaining
the Form 592 filing requirement. Section 1001 states: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully
falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or
fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain
false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than
five years, or both.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Hadson's argument implies that because a hard copy of the Form 592 information will not be filed with the Commission
pipelines will knowingly provide inaccurate or incorrect information through electronic means. The Commission
believes that the language of the statute is broad enough to cover electronic postings. However, in order to prevent
any such fraudulent conduct, the Commission deems the electronic posting of the Form 592 information equivalent
to a filing for purposes of 18 U.S.C. 1001.

Since contemporaneously with this order the Commission is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) which proposes

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ozark asserts that the Commission's order on remand ignores the court's instructions requiring the Commission to
consider the effect of Ozark's evidence on the question of control. Ozark contends that it simply relies upon an equally
deficient rationale for concluding, without reference to any evidence, that Tennessee Ozark and Ozark Pipeline
Corporation each, individually, ``controls'' Ozark, thereby making the marketing affiliates of those partners
marketing affiliates of Ozark. Ozark submits that to avoid problems inherent in finding that these partners can exercise
``affirmative control'' over Ozark, the Commission concluded that they can exercise ``negative control'' by simply
withholding their vote and vetoing any transportation transaction that would compete with their respective marketing
affiliates.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ozark argues that the ability to withhold a vote or ``veto'' any particular transaction does not exist as far as open
access transportation arrangements are concerned. Ozark states that open access pipelines, including Ozark, are
required by &sect;&sect;284.8(b) and 284.9(b) to transport natural gas on an open and non-discriminatory basis.
Ozark asserts that it is clearly prohibited from taking actions that would unduly prefer the marketing affiliates
of Ozark's partners and Ozark's partners have an obligation to the partnership to operate the pipeline within legal
parameters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ozark submits that its Commission-approved firm and interruptible rate schedules establish the criteria which
control who receives transportation service from Ozark. Ozark contends that decisions as to who will be permitted
to ship on Ozark may not be made at the whim of a particular Ozark partner. Ozark asserts that if the tariff criteria are
met, the request must be granted. Ozark states that, in fact, at a Management Committee meeting held on June 26, 1991,
Ozark's Management Committee, consisting of representatives of each of the partners, voted unanimously to approve
a resolution authorizing the President of Ozark or his designee to execute interruptible transportation agreements
on behalf of Ozark. Thus, Ozark contends, each of the partners ceded to the Operator the authority to enter into interruptible
transportation agreements. Ozark argues that no partnership vote is required and the Operator is bound by the tariff.
Ozark asserts that it should be obvious that not only are Tennessee Ozark and Ozark Pipeline Corporation not free to
veto transportation transactions but each has relinquished any right it might otherwise have to vote on such transactions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ozark submits that the record before the Commission shows an absence of control. Ozark asserts that the record before
the Commission shows a complete absence of any vetoing of any transportation transaction by any Ozark partner, consistent
with the delegation of authority to enter into such transportation agreements. Ozark argues that the Operator is
required to act in accordance with its fiduciary responsibilities to the partnership, not inconsistent with those
responsibilities. Ozark contends that the Commission's finding here that one partner could prefer its marketing
affiliate by vetoing transportation for others is directly contrary to the Commission's prior findings in this case
that ``[t]here are no facts before us in this proceeding which indicate that Ozark has discriminated in offering transportation
services to any party.''

Ozark submits that previously the Commission assumed that the Ozark partners would act together to provide preferences
to marketing affiliates of one of the partners or that one of the Ozark partners would be willing to grant preferences
to their Ozark partners in the hopes of obtaining reciprocal preferences. Ozark states that here the Commission assumes
that one of the partners will simply veto transactions that would benefit the partnership because the transaction
might compete with a transaction of one of its affiliates. Ozark asserts that there is no evidence to support any such
assumption. Ozark contends that to make such a finding the Commission would have to assume that Ozark would violate
its tariff, the Commission's regulations, and Texas partnership law. Ozark argues that the Commission would also
have to assume that its prior finding that there are no facts showing discrimination in Ozark's offering of transportation
is wrong. Ozark submits that not one of these assumptions is logical, consistent with any information relating to
Ozark, or supported by evidence in the record. Ozark asserts that all of the evidence shows that such control does not
exist including the fact that numerous transportation transactions have been conducted by Ozark for independent
marketers which compete with the marketing affiliates of Ozark partners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ozark states that its decisions as to who it will ship for are subject to review by this Commission and this Commission's
complaint procedures. Ozark contends that if the Commission were to find that Ozark had engaged in such conduct, enforcement
proceedings would commence and Ozark would either be ordered to provide the service required or its blanket certificate
would be revoked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Ozark argues that it does not control any of its individual partners, is not controlled by any of its individual
partners, and is not under common control with any of its individual partners. It asserts that nothing in the record
before the Commission suggests the contrary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ozark also contends that the Commission erred to the extent that it relied on the modified definition of ``control.''
Ozark states that in Order No. 497&hyph;A the Commission modified the definition of ``control'' in &sect;161.2.
Ozark states that on January 16, 1990, it sought rehearing of Order No. 497&hyph;A. Ozark states that the Commission
issued an order granting rehearing for purpose of further consideration but the Commission has never, to the best
of Ozark's knowledge, issued an order on the merits of Ozark's rehearing request. Ozark states that three years have
passed and numerous orders utilizing the definition have issued, including the order in this proceeding, and it considers
its request for rehearing as having been denied. However, to the extent that the Commission is applying the revised
definition to support the result here, Ozark seeks rehearing.

Ozark asserts that the Commission's order is not at all clear whether it is relying upon the modified definition of
``control'' to support its decision here. If the Commission's decision rests at all on ``whether acting alone or in
conjunction with others'' language, Ozark submits that the Commission's decision is in error. Ozark argues that
the effect of the additional language is to establish ``control'' in a 1% voting interest owner of a corporation. Ozark
asserts that the language creates an irrebuttable presumption of ``control'' by anyone holding at least a 10% voting
interest in a corporation, contrary to the clear statement in the balance of the regulation that the presumption of
control is rebuttable. Ozark contends these two effects result from the indisputable fact that any interest holder
must act with the requisite plurality in order for any particular action to be taken by a corporation or a partnership.
Ozark states that in its case unanimity is required for most actions so all partners must vote in the affirmative in
order for particular action to be taken. Ozark asserts that the fact that unanimity is required, again, does not constitute
control but, rather, evidences a lack of control. Accordingly, Ozark submits that the modified definition is inconsistent
with the existence of a rebuttable presumption, is arbitrary and capricious, and lacks any basis in reasoned decisionmaking.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission rejects Ozark's request for rehearing. Ozark argues that the Commission's definition of ``control''
is inconsistent with the existence of a rebuttable presumption. We disagree. Section 161.2 states that ``control
(including the terms `controlling,' `controlled by,' and `under common control with') includes, but is not limited
to, the possession, directly or indirectly and whether acting alone or in conjunction with others, of the authority
to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a company. A voting interest of 10 percent or more creates
a rebuttable presumption of control.''

To consider whether there is control here, we will review all the evidence Ozark has submitted on the issue. On March
10, 1987, Ozark filed an application under section 7 of the Natural Gas Act for a certificate of public convenience
and necessity. In that application, Ozark stated that it is a partnership and submitted its partnership agreement,

 that the partnership will be managed by a management committee, which will consist of equal representatives from
each partner, and will be operated by OPGC. In addition, OPGC selects the President of Ozark, who also acts as the CEO
and the Chairman of the management committee. On July 5, 1988, Ozark emphasized that its General Partnership agreement
specifies that no action may be taken by the management committee except by unanimous approval. On January 3, 1993,
Ozark presented, for the first time, a partial copy of a corporate resolution dated June 26, 1991. This states that
``the President of Ozark or his designee is hereby authorized to execute interruptible transportation agreements
on behalf of Ozark.'' Because Ozark's partners ceded to the President the authority to enter into interruptible transportation
agreements, no partnership vote is required. All of Ozark's firm capacity is committed to Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company and Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation. Therefore, Ozark claims that its partners cannot ``control''
transportation either affirmatively or negatively through veto power.

Ozark's owners are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Ozark Gas Pipeline Corporation (OPGC), which is a direct subsidiary of USX Corporation. Other subsidiaries include,
TXO Production Company, Marathon Oil Company and Delhi Gas Marketing Corporation. The activities of TXO Production
Company, the marketing affiliate, have been subsumed into Marathon Oil Company. However, TXO Production Corporation
still ships on Ozark, as does Delhi Gas Marketing Corporation, another marketing affiliate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Tennessee Ozark Gas Pipe Company, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, which
is in turn, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco, Inc. Tennessee's marketing affiliate is Tenngasco Corporation
(Tenngasco), which is a shipper on Ozark. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

We disagree. The partners still have authority to direct the management and policies of Ozark and could, at any time,
revoke the authority over interruptible transportation from the President. Moreover, under the terms of the partnership
agreement, OPGC selects the President of Ozark and operates Ozark. OPGC's marketing affiliates ship on Ozark. OPGC
has the requisite control described in section 161.2 of the Commission's regulations because it operates Ozark and,
through the President it selects, manages the pipeline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, ``control'' is not limited to authority over firm or interruptible transportation. Informal actions
of the management committee or the partners could provide the marketing affiliates with significant advantages,
such as non-public transportation information. For example, if Ozark intends to build a new pipeline under Part 284
of the Commission's regulations, the partners could convey that information to their marketing affiliates, and
the marketing affiliates would have an advantage over nonaffiliated marketers in obtaining customers. Likewise,
information with respect to the addition of new receipt of delivery points could be of significant advantage to the
marketing affiliates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ozark also states that it has not discriminated in the past and that no Ozark partner has vetoed any transportation
transactions. Ozark asserts that its operating structure together with its history should serve to successfully
rebut a presumption of control. But the partners' ability to control the management and policies of the pipeline is
not linked to whether Ozark has discriminated in the past. In Order No. 497, the Commission found sufficient anticompetitive
conduct industry-wide to substantiate the need for the rule. The court upheld the rule in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tenneco.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission need not produce evidence of discrimination with respect to each pipeline to justify application
of the rule to any one pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, Ozark argues that it is subject to the undue discrimination provisions of section 4 of the NGA and therefore
will not discriminate in favor of its affiliates.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
29
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Despite these prohibitions, the Commission found the need for additional guidelines to deter anticompetitive conduct
and concluded in Order No. 497 that standards of conduct and reporting requirements were appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hadson asserts that the Commission's procedures for acting on &sect;&sect;161.3(j) and 284.286(e) filings are
illegal. Hadson states that the Commission treats these filings as non-tariff filings which are assigned an MG docket
prefix. Hadson states that according to &sect;161.3(j) the filings are made to enable shippers and the Commission
to determine how the pipeline is complying with the substantive standards of conduct. Hadson submits that the filings
cannot achieve this purpose, however, since they are withheld from public notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and in the Commission's daily orders. Hadson contends that they are effectively concealed from public view in the
great majority of cases since shippers and other interested members of the public have no way of knowing when to look
to find a new or revised MG filing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hadson states that, moreover, the Commission has ruled that the MG filings are non-adversarial and that the Commission
may therefore rely upon non-public and off-the-record communications in determining whether a pipeline is in compliance
with the substantive standards or not.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Hadson states that the Commission has further ruled that no one may protest or intervene in the non-public proceedings.
Hadson states that any attempt to assert that a compliance filing is not in compliance with the law will be redocketed
in a new proceeding and treated as a complaint in which the erstwhile protestant bears the burden of conducting discovery
to prove that a pipeline's compliance filing is not in compliance with the law, rather than the pipeline being responsible
for showing compliance.

Hadson argues that similar problems taint the filings under section 284.286 since Order No. 636 appears to generally
incorporate the existing procedures and relies upon them to support the effective deregulation of the unbundled
pipeline merchants under the Subpart J certificates. Hadson states that the basis for this conclusion is that Order
No. 636 appears to maintain the dichotomy between tariff provisions (which presumably would be made in an MT or successor
docket) and procedures (which filing requirement, the Commission states, would be similar to that of &sect;161.3(j)).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
33
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Hadson asserts that the primary difference between the new and the current procedures, and the only apparent reason
for not incorporating &sect;161.3(j) along with the various other sections which were incorporated by reference,
is that the new rules have deleted the statement that the filing will enable shippers and the Commission to determine
how a pipeline is complying with the standards of conduct.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hadson contends that the deletion of the phrase is apparently not accidental since it accurately reflects the fact
that the new filing will not enable shippers or any other member of the public to (1) learn how a given pipeline defines
``operating employee'' or how it interprets the phrase ``practicable,'' (2) receive notice of any such filing, (3)
have an opportunity to comment thereon, or (4) obtain a decision based upon public evidence compiled in a public record
in accordance with applicable law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hadson states that faced with the Commission's determination to leave the definitional difficulties to be resolved
in the individual restructuring dockets, it did not seek judicial review of Order No. 636 on these issues and has diligently
raised these points in its comments on various pipelines' proposed Order No. 636 compliance plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hadson asserts that the issue here is whether the Commission may rely upon what Hadson calls the stealth procedures
of section 161.3(j) for purposes of making its decision in this docket to eliminate the publicly available monitoring
requirement. For the reason set forth above, Hadson submits that the Commission cannot do so.

2. Commission Ruling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission rejects Hadson's argument that its procedures for acting on &sect;161.3(j) and &sect;284.286(e)
filings prohibit public participation. Hadson misinterprets &sect;284.286(e). It requires pipelines to file
procedures for complying with standards of conduct as part of their publicly noticed compliance filings.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
34
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Any interested person can participate in those proceedings and protest pipelines' proposals for complying with
the standards. All the pipelines' compliance filings have been publicly available and Hadson, as well as other interested
persons, have had ample opportunity to comment on those procedures. In fact, Hadson intervened in 91 restructuring
proceedings and filed comments with respect to several pipelines' standards of conduct.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Contrary to Hadson's claims of ``stealth,'' the Commission's decisions with respect to the standards of conduct
will be reviewed in the context of the restructuring proceedings.

Finally, Hadson incorrectly states that the Commission treated the MG filings as non-public. These filings are public
and are available through the Commission's Records Information and Management System. In addition, all conversations
that occurred between the Commission staff and pipelines were memorialized in memoranda that were placed in the Commission's
public files.

Therefore, not only are the MG filings public, but contrary to Hadson's assertions, they have no real relation to our
decision to eliminate the requirement to file Form 592s. The MG dockets concern the pipelines' general implementation
of the standards of conduct. In contrast, Form 592 is a log of specific transportation transactions. As stated, we
are eliminating the requirements to file Form 592s because the information contained in them will be available on
pipelines' EBBs.

However, the Commission does agree that, prospectively, it can facilitate access to pipelines' standards of conduct
filings by publicly noticing them. As a result, the Commission will require all future standards of conduct filings
made under &sect;161.3(j) and all requests for waiver of the standards to include form notices suitable for publishing
in the

E. Interpretation of ``Operating Employee'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to questions raised by Hadson and other companies and in order to assist pipelines in their compliance
with the separation of operating personnel as required by Standard G and the reporting requirements of &sect;250.16(b),
the Commission will clarify what type of employee it considers an ``operating employee.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard G, 18 CFR 161.3(g), states that ``[t]o the maximum extent practicable a [pipeline's] operating employees
and the operating employees of its marketing affiliate must function independently of each other.'' In addition,
under the reporting requirements of &sect;250.16(b), ``[a]n interstate pipeline must file *&blank;*&blank;*
(1)[n]ew and existing tariff provisions containing *&blank;*&blank;* (i) [a] complete list of operating personnel
and facilities shared by the interstate natural gas pipeline and the affiliated marketing or brokering company.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While not mandating organizational separation, Standard G ensures against affiliate preference and the discriminatory
dissemination of information by requiring a pipeline to provide, to the maximum extent practicable, for the independent
functioning of ``operating personnel'' of the pipeline and its marketing affiliate. The contemporaneous disclosure
mandate of Standard F requires that to the extent a pipeline provides to a marketing affiliate any information related
to transportation of natural gas, it must provide that information contemporaneously to all potential shippers,
affiliated and nonaffiliated, on its system. Standard G's requirement that operating employees are to function
independently to the maximum extent practicable will help ensure that the opportunity to share such information
is minimized. If, for example, a pipeline and its marketing affiliate could evade the contemporaneous disclosure
requirement simply by using the same person to arrange transportation on the pipeline and market gas for the affiliate,
the rule would be substantially undermined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout the rulemaking proceeding, however, the Commission has held that complete divestment, divorcement,
or organizational separation of pipelines and their marketing affiliates is not necessary to prevent the abuses
at which the marketing affiliates rule is aimed. The independent functioning requirement does not require a pipeline
to separate all of its employees from those of a marketing affiliate, but rather only operating employees. This determination
is consistent with the Commission's finding that complete organizational separation is unnecessary and may even
be harmful where divestment chills essential day-to-day communications between the pipeline and its affiliate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission stated in Order No. 497&hyph;A that the phrase ```operating employees' can include officers, directors
and managers as well as non-management employees.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
44
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 However, without further clarification of that phrase, pipelines may not be able to identify properly every ``operating
employee,'' especially those shared with their affiliate. Since different pipelines are faced with different practical
circumstances, a person's status as an ``operating employee'' will, in many situations, depend not on his or her occupation
or title, but on his or her actual function within the company.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To provide further guidance, the Commission interprets ``operating employee'' to mean an individual who has day-to-day
duties and responsibilities for planning, directing, organizing, or carrying out gas-related operations, including
gas transportation, gas sales or gas marketing activities. Examples of operating employees include any member of
the board of directors, officers, managers, supervisors, regulatory and technical personnel with duties involving
day-to-day gas purchasing, marketing, sales, transportation, operations, dispatching, storage, or related activities.
Such operating employees may be expected to receive and use information concerning such functions for the benefit
of the specific entity for which they work directly. Under normal circumstances, employees, including highly-placed
operatives such as members of the board of directors or officers of the corporations, who do not have such duties would
not be likely to receive or use transportation-related information subject to Standard F. To the extent a non-operating
person obtains such information and provides it to the marketing affiliate, the pipeline would be required to disclose
the information contemporaneously pursuant to Standard F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employees with no direct operational responsibilities and whose duties are only supportive in nature need not be
considered operating employees. Examples of non-operating employees include support personnel not engaged in
the day-to-day marketing, sales, transportation or other gas-related operations of the affiliated companies,
clerical and secretarial staff, general office building maintenance personnel, and payroll and general accounting
staff.

F. Extension of Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Commission will only extend the sunset date of Order No. 497's reporting requirements from December
31, 1993, until June 30, 1994, because contemporaneously with this order the Commission is issuing a NOPR in Docket
No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;000 which, among other things, substantially revises Order No. 497's reporting requirements.
The Commission believes that extending the sunset provision to June 30, 1994, will allow the Commission enough time
to issue a final rule setting forth the new reporting requirements and will also prevent any gaps in the reporting requirements
which would occur if the Commission simply let the sunset provision lapse.

Nos. 497&hyph;D and 636 (OMB Control No. 1902&hyph;0157).

The information required under FERC&hyph;592 enables the Commission to carry out its legislative mandate under
the NGA and NGPA and will help ensure a viable capacity release market under the Commission's Order No. 636. Specifically,
the required information allows the Commission to review/monitor pipeline transportation, sales, and storage
transactions with its marketing affiliates to deter undue discrimination and to take appropriate action, where
and when necessary. The information is also used by others to indicate whether or not there has been discrimination
in pipeline/affiliate/nonaffiliate transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is notifying OMB that there is no change in the FERC&hyph;592 reporting requirements as a result of
the subject order and requesting that OMB extend its approval of FERC&hyph;592 through June 30, 1994. The 180-day
extension of FERC&hyph;592 is necessary to allow the Commission adequate time to prepare a final rule based on the
related NOPR, issued concurrently with this order, in Docket No. RM94&hyph;6&hyph;000 (Standards of Conduct and
Reporting Requirements for Transportation and Affiliate Transactions). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Interested persons may obtain further information by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941
North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202)
208&hyph;1415]. Comments on the FERC&hyph;592 reporting requirements may also be sent to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 generally requires a rule to be effective not less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 unless good cause is found to shorten the time period. The sunset date for the reporting requirements will expire before
the APA's 30 day publication requirement has been fulfilled thus causing a gap in the reporting requirements. Therefore,
in order to prevent a gap in the rule's reporting requirements, this final rule is effective January 1, 1994.

Statutory Provisions

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 31 of the Trademark (Lanham) Act of 1946, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1113), authorizes the Commissioner to establish
fees for the filing and processing of an application for the registration of a trademark or other mark, and for all other
services and materials furnished by the PTO relating to trademarks and other marks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;179 established the fee for filing a trademark application at $245 per class. Public Law 103&hyph;179
took effect on December 3, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Recovery Level Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing fee schedule, along with the adjustment to the trademark application fee, will recover $518,692,000
in fiscal year 1994, of which $4,830,000 is attributable to the increase in the trademark application fee. The enacted
1994 budget is $504,021,000. An additional $14,671,000 of patent statutory fees will be collected in 1994 and will
be deposited to the Fee Surcharge Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Patent statutory fees are subject to the provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as amended by
Public Law 102&hyph;204. Of the total amount of income expected to be collected in 1994 under 35 U.S.C. 41 (a) and (b),
$103,000,000 must be deposited to the Fee Surcharge Fund for deficit reduction purposes in lieu of seeking general
taxpayer funds from the U.S. Treasury. The $103,000,000 is deposited in a special account in the U.S. Treasury, reserved
exclusively for use by the PTO, and is made available to the PTO through the appropriation process. For 1994, the Congress
appropriated $88,329,000 from the Fee Surcharge Fund.

General Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There will be a grace period of 60 days, beginning December 3, 1993, and ending January 31, 1994. During the grace period,
any party who submits a trademark application, which is otherwise sufficient, with a fee of at least $210, but less
than $245, will be notified of the fee deficiency and permitted to supplement it within a 30-day period set by the notice
of the insufficient fee. If the applicant submits the amount by which the fee is deficient within the 30-day period,
the application will retain its original filing date. If the amount by which the fee is deficient is not submitted within
30 days, the application papers and fee will be returned to the applicant. Any trademark application submitted after
January 31, 1994 with a deficient fee payment will be returned to the applicant.

37 CFR 2.6 Trademark fees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2.6, subparagraph (a)(1), is revised to adjust the fee authorized by the Trademark (Lanham) Act of 1946 in
accordance with the provisions of Public Law 103&hyph;179.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule change is in conformity with the requirements of Executive Order 12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act
of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are no information collection requirements relating to patent and trademark fee rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation was reviewed by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget
under Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PTO has determined that this rule change has no Federalism implications affecting the relationship between the
National Government and the States as outlined in Executive Order 12612.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice and opportunity for comment are unnecessary under 5 U.S.C. 553(6)(b) because this rule change merely restates
a Congressionally-mandated fee change. Because notice of proposed rulemaking is not required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) does not apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PTO published a notice of proposed rulemaking on July 21, 1993, (58 FR 39102) to increase the trademark fee to $245
based on pending legislation that would have given PTO the authority to raise trademark fees in excess of the Consumer
Price Index. The legislation as passed (Pub. L. 103&hyph;179) simply increased the trademark application filing
fee to $245 effective the date of enactment.

NMFS issues this notification to announce that 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) of summer flounder commercial quota available
to the State of North Carolina has been transferred to the State of Rhode Island. This transfer adjusts the commercial
quota for the State of North Carolina to 3,121,750 pounds (1,416,016 kg) and adjusts the Rhode Island quota to 1,946,851
pounds (883,086 kg). As a result of this transfer, NMFS announces that vessels issued a Federal fisheries permit for
the summer flounder fishery may resume landing summer flounder in the State of Rhode Island until further notice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery (FMP) are found at 50 CFR part
625 (December 4, 1992, 57 FR 57358). The regulations require an annual specification of a commercial quota that is
apportioned among the coastal states from North Carolina through Maine. The process to set the annual commercial
quota and the percent allocated to each state are described in &sect;625.20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commercial quota for summer flounder for the 1993 calendar year is set equal to 12.35 million pounds (5.6 million
kg) (January 22, 1993, 58 FR 5658). The percent allocated to each state was adjusted by Amendment 4 to the FMP (September
24, 1993, 58 FR 49937) with 15.68298 percent or 1,936,851 pounds (878,550 kg) allocated to Rhode Island, and 27.44584
percent, or 3,389,565 pounds (1,537,497 kg) allocated to North Carolina.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An emergency interim rule published August 26, 1993, (58 FR 45075), and extended on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62556),
allows two or more states, under mutual agreement and with the concurrence of the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS,
(Regional Director), to transfer or combine summer flounder commercial quota. The Regional Director is required
to consider the criteria set forth in &sect;625.20 in the evaluation of requests for quota transfers or combinations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1993 coastwide commercial quota apportioned to North Carolina effective on January 1, 1993 (58 FR 5658; January
22, 1993), in the amount of 3,435,214 pounds (1.56 million kg) was revised by Amendment 4 to the FMP effective October
25, 1993 (58 FR 49937), reducing the amount by 45,649 pounds (20,706 kg) totalling 3,389,565 pounds (1.54 million
kg). North Carolina made three transfers during 1993 totalling 257,815 pounds (116,942 kg) of summer flounder, reducing
the amount to 3,131,750 pounds (1.42 million kg). Two transfers were made to Virginia for 125,000 pounds (56,699 kg)
each; one was effective on November 3, 1993 (58 FR 59196; November 8, 1993), and the other was effective on November
19, 1993 (58 FR 62050). The third transfer was made to New Jersey in the amount of 7,815 pounds (3,545 kg) and was effective
on November 18, 1993 (58 FR 61844; November 23, 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Regional Director is required to publish a notification in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
advising a state, and notifying Federal vessel and dealer permit holders that, effective upon a specific date, a portion
of a state's commercial quota has been transferred to, or combined with, the commercial quota of another state.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Carolina and Rhode Island have agreed to transfer 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) of North Carolina's commercial quota
to Rhode Island. The Regional Director has determined that the criteria set forth in &sect;625.20 have been met, and
publishes this notification of quota transfer. The revised quotas for the calendar year 1993 are: North Carolina_3,121,750
pounds (1,416,016 kg); Rhode Island_1,946,851 pounds (883,086 kg).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of this quota transfer, the previous notice of closure effective December 22, 1993, is rescinded and vessels
may again land summer flounder in Rhode Island until the available 1993 quota is harvested.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The fishery for coastal migratory pelagic fish (king mackerel, Spanish mackerel, cero, cobia, little tunny, dolphin,
and, in the Gulf of Mexico only, bluefish) is managed under the Fishery Management Plan for the Coastal Migratory Pelagic
Resources of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic
Fishery Management Councils (Councils) and is implemented by regulations at 50 CFR part 642, under the authority
of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Catch limits recommended by the Councils and implemented by NMFS for the Gulf of Mexico migratory group of king mackerel
for the current fishing year (July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994, 58 FR 58509, November 2, 1993) set the commercial
quota of king mackerel in the Florida west coast zone at 865,000 pounds (392,361 kg). In accordance with 50 CFR 642.31(a)(2),
from the date that 75 percent of the zone's commercial quota has been harvested until a closure of the Florida west coast
zone has been effected, king mackerel in or from the EEZ may be possessed aboard or landed from a permitted vessel in
amounts not exceeding 50 per day. Such 50-fish trip limit remains in effect through June 30, 1994, the end of the fishing
year, unless 100 percent of the commercial quota is reached before June 30, in which case the commercial fishery for
king mackerel in the Florida west coast zone is closed by publication of a notice in the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 16, 1992, NMFS promulgated regulations, effective January 1, 1993, establishing a license-limitation-limited-entry
system for the Pacific Coast commercial groundfish fishery. The regulations, among other things, require that an
owner of a vessel wishing to participate in the limited-entry fishery have a Federally issued limited-entry permit
endorsed with an appropriate vessel size endorsement. In view of a delay in issuing certain other regulations necessary
to fully implement this system, this action suspends until April 1, 1994, the effectiveness of the vessel size endorsement
requirement, which limits variances in vessel length from the length specified in a permit. The intent of this action
is to allow vessel owners to participate in the limited-entry fishery who would otherwise be barred from the fishery
by the size endorsement requirement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 16, 1992, NMFS promulgated regulations codified at 50 CFR 663.30&hyph;663.43, and effective January
1, 1993, establishing a license-limitation-limited-entry system for the Pacific Coast commercial groundfish
fishery. The regulations, among other things, require that an owner of a vessel wishing to participate in the limited-entry
fishery, have a Federally issued limited-entry permit endorsed with an appropriate vessel size endorsement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, each limited-entry permit is endorsed with the overall length of the vessel with which it initially qualified
for a permit. Under 50 CFR 663.33(f)(2), a limited-entry permit endorsed for gear other than trawl gear may be registered
for use with a vessel up to 5 feet (1.52 m) longer than, the same length as, or any length shorter than, the size endorsed
on the existing permit. A limited-entry permit endorsed for trawl gear may be registered for use with a vessel between
5 feet (1.52 m) shorter, and 5 feet (1.52 m) longer, than the size endorsed on the existing permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the owner would like to use a limited entry permit with a vessel of a length that exceeds the variance, &sect;663.33(g)
allows the owner to combine two or more limited-entry permits from smaller vessels, in order to ``step-up'' to a permit
for the larger vessel. However, before any permits may be combined, &sect;663.33(g) also requires the Director,
Northwest Region, NMFS (Regional Director), with the professional advice of marine architects and other qualified
individuals, and after consultation with the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), to develop and implement,
through amendment of the regulations, a standardized measure of harvest capacity for the purpose of determining
the appropriate endorsed lengths for limited-entry permits created by combining two or more permits with smaller
size endorsements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the Regional Director has completed the process of consultation with the appropriate persons and the Council,
and has developed regulations to implement the required standardized measure of harvest capacity and associated
rules for combining permits, the regulations have not yet been proposed. However, this proposal will soon be published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public comment, and a final rule is expected to be published and to be effective by April 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In anticipation of issuance by January 1, 1994, of the regulations governing the combining of permits, some vessel
owners have acquired larger vessels and additional limited-entry permits. NMFS estimates that by January 1, 1994,
30 or more vessel owners will have limited entry permits endorsed with the size  of  a qualifying vessel that has been
replaced by a vessel more than 5 feet (1.52m) longer than the qualifying vessel. Under &sect;663.33(f)(2), none of
these vessel owners could participate in the fishery until he/she obtains a single permit endorsed with the size of
the larger vessel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to allow limited-entry permit holders in the situation just described to participate in the limited-entry
fishery until the date by which the Regional Director is expected to have issued the necessary final rule, NMFS is suspending,
until April 1, 1994, the effectiveness of 663.33(f)(2)_the provision of the regulations imposing limitations of
endorsed length on the use of limited-entry permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to take this action would result in limited-entry permit owners who have already obtained, or are in the process
of obtaining, additional limited entry permits for combination into a larger permit being unable to participate
in the limited-entry fishery until the Regional Director issues the necessary final rule. The limited-entry program
is not intended to prevent permit owners from participating in a fishery for which they have obtained the appropriate
limited-entry permits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS does not expect this suspension will result in much, if any, additional harvest capacity entering the limited-entry
fishery during the time of the suspension. The harvest of all major species taken in the limited-entry fishery during
the first 3 months of the calendar year is controlled with restrictive trip limits that serve as a disincentive to any
permit holders bringing new, large-capacity fishing vessels into the fishery.

et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this rule must be in effect at the time limited-entry permits are required for participation in the limited-entry
fishery (January 1, 1994) in order to allow vessel owners who intend to combine permits to participate in the limited-entry
fishery pending establishment of a system to combine permits, it is unnecessary and not in the public interest to provide
prior public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). Also, because this rule temporarily relieves a restriction, it is
being made effective immediately without a 30-day delay in effectiveness under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 8, 1990, President Bush signed into law the 1990 amendments (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535). This statute adds
to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) among other sections, section 403(q) (21 U.S.C. 343(q)), which
makes nutrition labeling mandatory for most foods, and section 403(r)(2) (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(2)), which gives FDA
authority to define nutrient content claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the 1990 amendments, FDA published proposed rules on November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), and final rules on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2066 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) implementing, among other things, the sections of the act on mandatory nutrition labeling and nutrient content
claims, among other things, for foods in conventional food form. Because of the DS act, the final regulations did not
include provisions on the nutrition labeling of, or nutrient content claims for, dietary supplements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DS act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;571) was signed into law on October 6, 1992. In section 202(a)(1), the DS act established
a moratorium until December 15, 1993, on the implementation of the 1990 amendments with respect to dietary supplements
that are not in the form of conventional food. Section 202(a)(2) of the DS act required the Secretary (and, by delegation,
FDA) to issue new proposed regulations that are applicable to dietary supplements no later than June 15, 1993, and
final regulations by December 31, 1993. On June 18, 1993, FDA issued proposed regulations in response to this provision
of the DS act (58 FR 33700 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). Elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FDA is issuing the final rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 10(a)(1)(A) and (B) of the 1990 amendments (21 U.S.C. 343 note), section 403(q) and (r)(2) of the act
are effective 6 months after the promulgation of final regulations or after the date that proposed regulations are
considered to be final regulations. Thus, because the final regulations on the nutrition labeling of, and nutrient
content claims for, dietary supplements are being issued on January 4, 1994, section 403(q) and 403(r)(2) will be
effective with respect to dietary supplements July 5, 1994. However, section 10(a)(3)(B) of the 1990 amendments
provides that if the Secretary and, by delegation, FDA&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;  `` * * * finds that compliance
with sections 403(q) and 403(r)(2) of such Act would cause an undue economic hardship, the Secretary may delay the
application of such sections for no more than one year.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA found such ``undue economic hardship'' existed for the conventional food industry in a final rule published on
January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2070), entitled ``Food Labeling: Establishment of Date of Application'' (hereinafter called
the date of application final rule). In that document, FDA delayed the application of section 403(q) and (r)(2) for
1 year, until May 8, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposed rules on nutrition labeling (58 FR 33715 at 33725) and nutrient content claims (58 FR 33731 at 33748)
for dietary supplements, FDA asked for comment on whether a similar delay in application of section 403(q) and (r)(2)
would be appropriate for dietary supplements. The agency gave interested persons until August 17, 1993, to comment
on whether the 6-month proposed compliance date would cause ``undue economic hardship.'' FDA received approximately
2,000 letters of which approximately one-third contain one or more comments concerning either the date of application
or other economic issues from consumers, consumer advocacy organizations, health care professionals, professional
societies, universities, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, trade associations, and State governments.
A discussion of the agency's decision, and a summary of the comments, concerning the delay of the date of application
and other economic issues and the agency responses follow.

II. Undue Economic Hardship

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments requested that FDA extend the date that the nutrition labeling and nutrient content claim provisions
of the act will be applied to dietary supplements. Most comments requested an additional year, for a total compliance
period of 18 months. One comment proposed a delay of at least 9 months. The comments reported many examples of the difficulties
in meeting a 6-month compliance period. Several comments stated that the amount of time needed to redesign labels
would far exceed the resources available. One comment reported that the insufficient time allowed to revise labels
would result in some products being removed from the market temporarily while new labels are being prepared. An additional
comment requested the extension because of the difficulties in the logistics of revising existing labels, printing,
packaging, and exhausting existing label supplies with a short compliance period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments that requested a delay cited the savings that could be gained with insignificant loss of benefits.
One comment reported that inventory disposal could be reduced by 85 percent with an 18-month compliance period. Another
comment stated that FDA's cost estimate of $20 million represents 1 percent of industry sales but a much larger percentage
of industry profits. The comment explained that extending the compliance period would reduce the costs of compliance
and, therefore, minimize any reduction in profits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested a delay because there will be additional costs for compliance with the upcoming United States
Pharmacopoeia (USP) standards. The comment stated that resources could be better spent if these compliance efforts
were completed concurrently rather than consecutively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested a delay because of the overlap with the final months of the extended period that was allowed for
foods in conventional food form. The comment reported that many conventional food manufacturers and their label
suppliers are rushing to produce final labels for such foods. The comment said that supplement manufacturers will
not be able to secure revised labels for their products from label manufacturers in time to meet a 6-month deadline
because of the competition for label manufacturers' resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that it will be difficult for dietary supplement manufacturers to comply within 6 months, especially
in light of the fact that label suppliers are currently stressed with label orders from manufacturers of food in conventional
food form who are attempting to meet the May 1994 deadline for complying with the 1990 amendments. The agency also agrees
that an extension of the date of application would result in significant savings for the industry. Administrative
costs, printing costs, and label inventory disposal costs are all dependent on the length of the compliance period.
The agency has determined that the costs of the regulations could be reduced with an extension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency made a determination in the date of application final rule that the 1990 amendments will result in an undue
economic hardship on manufacturers of food products in conventional food form (58 FR 2070 at 2075). The agency notes
that the costs of compliance for manufacturers of foods in conventional food form represent less than 1 percent of
sales. The costs of compliance with a 6-month compliance period for dietary supplements is approximately 2 percent
of sales. Therefore, if the agency does not extend the date of application for dietary supplement manufacturers,
that segment of the food industry will be asked to bear higher relative costs than the agency determined were reasonable
for foods in conventional food form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all these reasons, the agency determines that the congressionally mandated date of application will result in
an undue economic hardship for dietary supplement manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The Agency's Determination of a Date of Application of Section 403(q) and (r)(2) of the Act as Applied to Dietary
Supplements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined that undue economic hardship will result if the dietary supplement industry is required
to comply with section 403(q) and (r) of the act within 6 months. As will be shown in the following discussion on the economic
impact, a 6-month delay (total of 12 months to comply) in the application of section 403(q) and (r)(2) to dietary supplements
would result in over 40 percent savings of compliance cost, and a 12-month delay (total of 18 months to comply) would
result in over 50 percent savings. Given the large disparity in costs of compliance for manufacturers of dietary supplements
if they are required to comply in 6 months, as compared to those that are being borne by manufacturers of food in conventional
form, FDA finds that it should tailor the delay to reduce the costs for dietary supplement manufacturers and thus to
minimize the disparity. Therefore, the agency concludes that it is appropriate to delay the application date for
dietary supplements for 12 months, as it did for foods in conventional food form. Thus, the agency intends to apply
section 403(q) and (r)(2) to foods labeled after July 1, 1995. The agency fully expects that some dietary supplement
firms will be able to comply before this date once the pressure on printing labels for foods in conventional food form
is eased after May 8, 1994. Therefore, consumers can expect to begin enjoying the health benefits of the label changes
prior to July 1, 1995.

III. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some comments agreed with the agency's estimates of the costs of relabeling. Many comments were directed at issues
covered by the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM), which addressed the safe use of dietary supplements
(58 FR 33690, June 18, 1993). Several comments stated that the three proposals that the agency issued (there was a proposed
rule on health claims (58 FR 33700 in addition to the proposals on nutrition labeling and nutrient content claims))
and the ANPRM should be considered one proposal. These comments stated that the economic impact of the four documents
would exceed $100 million and would be considered a major rule under Executive Order 12291. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency disagrees. Executive Order 12291 did not apply to advance notices. Therefore, no analysis of that document
was required by that Executive Order. (FDA has not taken any action with respect to the ANPRM that would make it subject
to Executive Order 12866). The three proposals are concerned with the labeling of dietary supplements, while the
ANPRM is concerned with other issues. Thus, the costs and benefits associated with regulatory alternatives described
in the ANPRM can be separated from those resulting from the three proposals on labeling actions. The agency has evaluated
the labeling actions together, however, because it is not possible to separate the impacts of the various labeling
actions. Finally, FDA is taking no further action with respect to the ANPRM at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Several comments objected to the agency's estimate of the number of products that will be affected by the nutrition
labeling and nutrient content claims rulemakings. Two comments stated that there are 25,000 products that are potentially
affected by the rules, rather than the agency's estimate of 5,000 products. Another comment stated that there are
approximately 25,000 herbal products alone that would be required to be tested and relabeled. Another comment objected
to the agency's estimate because the agency failed to include amino acids, herbal products, and other dietary supplements
that have no recognizable food function. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its analysis of the proposals, FDA stated that there could be as many as 25,000 products that could be considered
to be dietary supplements. The agency reduced that number to 5,000, an estimate of the number of vitamin and mineral
supplement products, because: (1) Many products that contain herbs or other similar nutritional substances would
not be subject to the nutrition label requirements because they do not contain the nutrients that must be declared,
and (2) some products marketed as dietary supplements would be unaffected by the 1990 amendments because they bear
drug claims that make them subject to the drug provisions of the act. For these reasons, it is clear that not all 25,000
products would be required to be tested or relabeled in response to the regulations implementing the 1990 amendments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, FDA is convinced by the comments that some herbal products and other dietary supplements might need to be
tested and relabeled as a result of these regulations. FDA is unable to determine exactly how many of those products
would be covered by the food provisions of the act rather than by the drug provisions. Therefore, the agency's final
analysis of the rules is based on a range of products between 5,000 and 25,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Several comments objected to the agency's estimate that approximately 150 firms will be affected by the regulations.
Some comments stated that approximately 500 firms would be affected by the proposed rules if made final. Another comment
stated that 250 herb manufacturers and 150 manufacturers of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals would be
affected. Another comment objected to the agency's source for the number of firms. The comment explained that Dunn
and Bradstreet's Electronic Yellow Pages is primarily a listing for public companies, and the majority of supplement
manufacturers are privately-held corporations. The comment suggested that conservative estimates suggest that
there are a minimum of 150 herb companies alone.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has confirmed that the Electronic Yellow Pages covers both public and private organizations of all types
and sizes. The agency admits that the Electronic Yellow Pages is not a perfect source for the number of firms, but FDA
believes that it is not entirely inadequate. The major difference between the agency's estimate and those of the comments
is the inclusion or exclusion of manufacturers herbal products and products containing other similar nutritional
substances. As stated in the response to the previous comment, the agency has determined that at least some of these
types of dietary supplement products may be subject to the nutrition labeling provisions. However, because many
of these products do not contain significant amounts of nutrients, many manufacturers will not be faced with the necessity
of relabeling their products. For these reasons, the agency believes that its estimate of the number of firms may be
low, but that to include all herbal products manufacturers and manufacturers of other similar nutritional substances
would inflate the estimate. However, the agency has no basis on which to arrive at the actual number of firms. Therefore,
in its final analysis, the agency is estimating the total number of firms affected to be between 150 and 300.

B. Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Several comments disagreed with the agency's estimate of administrative costs. The comments stated that actual
administrative expenses would be at least $1,000 per label. Administrative expenses, according to the comments,
are associated with the creation or redesign, proofreading, legal review, pricing, bid review, and retraining of
customer service and sales staff. One comment estimates that administrative costs to one firm would be 80 to 120 hours
of executive time, or approximately $2,500 to $3,750.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that the factors that determine administrative costs are very complicated. The agency's estimates
of administrative costs are based on a compliance cost model for food labeling created for FDA by Research Triangle
Institute (RTI) (Ref. 1). According to RTI, many firms estimate that administrative effort would be twice as high
for a 6-month compliance period as for a 12-month compliance period. In the dietary supplement proposals, FDA estimated
that for a 6-month compliance period, manufacturers of dietary supplements will incur administrative costs of $850
per firm. The range of administrative cost estimates submitted in the comments was broad and there were no identifiable
patterns to the estimates given. Although FDA acknowledges that its assumptions may have resulted in underestimates,
the comments did not provide enough detailed information to permit FDA to evaluate the administrative cost estimates
that they submitted. Therefore, the agency is not altering its original estimates based on these comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined that total administrative costs for a 6-month compliance period are between $130,000 and
$250,000, depending on the exact number of firms affected by the regulations. As determined by the contractor's study
(Ref. 1), administrative costs are lower with longer compliance periods. A 1-year compliance period results in administrative
costs of between $65,000 and $125,000. An 18-month compliance period results in administrative costs of between
$50,000 and $94,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. One comment stated that the requirement that herbal dietary supplements be required to bear nutrition labeling
would mandate that all herbal products be assayed for their nutrient content. The comment further explained that
testing for 12 nutrients would cost $588 per product for a total of $15 million for 25,000 products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that to the extent that herbal product manufacturers will provide nutrition labeling, herbal products
will need to be assayed for their nutrient content. The agency notes, however, that many herbs do not contain significant
amounts of the nutrients that must be listed in the nutrition label, and that this fact is determinable from reference
works without testing. Thus, these herbs will not need to be tested. Many comments admitted that, in general, herbal
products do not contain significant amounts of nutrients and are not consumed for their nutrient content. However,
some herbal products and combination products will require nutrient testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposals, the agency assumed that dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals will not undergo any additional
testing as a result of the nutrition labeling requirements. Comments did not object to this assumption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in its final analysis, the agency is estimating that as many as 20,000 products may undergo testing once
every 5 years for a total discounted analytical cost over the next 20 years of $33 million (7 percent discount rate).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. One comment agreed, and several comments disagreed, with the agency's estimate of label printing and redesign
costs. The comments that disagreed stated that printing and redesign costs would be at least $800 to $1,200 per label.
One comment stated that the cost of redesigning and printing each label would be 2 hours of desktop redesign, $20 for
linotronic service, and $600 for new plates, for a total of $750 per label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment objected to FDA's assumption that label revisions for supplements are less comprehensive than revisions
for foods in conventional food form. The comment states that incorporating the ``Nutrition Facts'' section plus
the ingredient list will necessitate complete redistribution of information on many labels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the analysis of the proposed rules, the agency estimated that, for a 6-month compliance period, printing and redesign
costs would be approximately $1,000 per label. The comments do not suggest that the agency's estimate is incorrect.
Therefore, the agency's final analysis of printing costs is based on a per label cost of $1,000 for each of between 15,000
and 75,000 labels, or between $15 million and $75 million. According to the RTI study, the length of the compliance
period determines a firm's ability to combine planned label changes with mandated changes. Therefore, incremental
labeling and redesign activities are less costly with lengthier compliance periods. If the agency extended the compliance
period by only 6 months, printing and redesign costs would be between $7.5 million and $37.5 million. The 1-year extension
that the agency is providing will reduce printing and redesign costs to between $6 million and $28 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Several comments provided data on label inventories that would be subject to disposal. These comments stated that
a 4- to 6-month supply of product labels is common, resulting in $3.4 million to $5.1 million of label inventory that
will be discarded. Another comment suggested that its dietary supplement label and box inventory disposal costs
would be $325,000 with a 6-month compliance period, $200,000 with a 1-year compliance period, and $50,000 with an
18-month compliance period. One comment estimated the cost of discarding noncompliant labels would be approximately
$30,000 for one firm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The estimates provided by the comments are in line with the agency's preliminary estimate of label inventory disposal
costs. Therefore, the agency is not changing its estimate based on the comments. The cost of label inventory disposal
for a 6-month compliance period is between $5 million and $25 million, depending on the number of products affected.
According to the RTI study and comments, lengthier compliance periods allow firms to use up more existing label supplies,
thus reducing inventory disposal costs. According to data submitted in response to the Regulatory Impact Analysis
document that was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366), and adjusted to reflect the range of products affected, if the agency had extended
the compliance period for an additional 6 months, inventory disposal costs would be between $3 million and $13 million.
The 18-month compliance period that the agency is providing will result in costs of between $2 million and $9 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Several comments disagreed with the agency's estimate of the cost of inventory disposal. The comments argued that
firms would dispose of finished product in addition to labels. The comments stated that typical product costs for
dietary supplements would result in an inventory value for the disposal of 5,000 products of between $48 million and
$73 million. One firm estimated its own cost of discarding noncompliant inventory would be approximately 30 percent
of finished goods inventory, or about $45,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because these proposals cover only the labeling of dietary supplements, the agency does not agree that there would
be any reason for firms to dispose of any product inventory. Nor did the comments provide an explanation as to why it
would be necessary to do so. Moreover, any product packaged and labeled in accordance with law before the date that
FDA begins to apply the section 403(q) and (r) of the act will not need to be relabeled. Therefore, the agency is not changing
its estimate based on this comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Several comments argued that the agency failed to consider the cost of discarding and redesigning catalogs, product
literature, and advertising. The comments suggested that these costs would be at least $40,000 per firm, or $20 million
for all firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments did not provide an explanation as to why it would be necessary to discard and redesign catalogs and product
literature. The agency does agree that, to the extent that these materials are labeling, they must comply with the
nutrient content and health claims provisions of the act. However, the agency believes that many of the claims made
in these types of materials are drug claims or structure-function claims, not health claims, and therefore are not
subject to these rules. The comments did not present evidence to support a different finding. Consequently, the agency
has no basis on which to conclude that extensive catalog and product literature redesign will be required by these
final rules. Therefore, the agency is not changing its estimate based on these comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Several comments argued that the agency failed to consider the cost of relabeling of product returned from the retailer.
The comments stated that it is common practice in the supplement industry to accept returns from retailers in the event
of a label change. Industry firms would be faced with a number of products returned from retailers unwilling to carry
products with older labels. The comments estimated the cost of processing returns, disposing of product, and applying
for full credit at $48 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any product labeled before the applicability date will not need to comply with the new nutrition labeling and nutrient
content claim provisions. Therefore, no product that is labeled in accordance with law before July 1, 1995, need be
returned, relabeled, or destroyed as a result of these new provisions. However, FDA agrees that to the extent that
product is returned, the cost of disposing of product returned from retailers because of ``old'' labeling should
be considered a cost of these regulations. However, the agency is unpersuaded of the magnitude of the cost and is unsure
of the extent to which ``old'' product will be returned. The comments provided insufficient information with which
the agency could estimate these costs. Therefore, the agency is not changing its estimates based on this comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Several comments expressed concern that the rules may cause the loss of many thousands of jobs, the closing of many
firms, and the loss of products from the marketplace. According to one comment, the proposed rules would cause the
loss of more than $10 million in sales and as many as 100 jobs in one company. Another comment stated a belief that 2 million
Americans will lose their jobs as a result of the regulations. The comments did not provide any specific information
as to how the regulations would cause the loss of jobs and products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that the inability to make certain nutrient content or health claims may reduce the marketability
of certain products and perhaps lead to a company's decision to remove a product from the marketplace. However, these
rules affect only labeling; they do not require any supplement to be removed from the market. Moreover, the agency
does not believe that many products are currently making health claims, as distinguished from drug claims or structure-function
claims. Therefore, the agency has no basis to find that these regulations will cause the problems described in these
comments. The agency believes that there is every reason to expect that the continued marketing of the vast majority
of dietary supplement products will be unaffected by these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. In the analysis of the proposed rules, the agency recognized that the rules could have an adverse impact on small
businesses. Most of the costs associated with labeling regulations are fixed costs, which are typically more burdensome
for small firms than for large firms because of the smaller sales base on which to spread costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that the small business exemption was inadequate because small firms would not be able to avoid
complying with the regulations because of competitive pressure. Another comment stated that the proposals would
be catastrophic to small business owners and workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA notes that the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act Amendments of 1993, which were enacted on August 13, 1993,
provide relief for small businesses from the requirements of section 403(q) of the act. The agency believes that the
new exemption for small businesses will significantly mitigate any negative impact on small firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. One comment stated that the proposed rule regarding health claims will cause pain, suffering, and death that would
not occur were labeling and advertising allowed to include health claims. The comment was unspecific as to why these
results would occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the absence of health claims causes pain, suffering, or death, these regulations provide any party with a vehicle
for submitting data to support a particular health claim for agency review. Therefore, the agency does not agree with
this comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. One comment stated that the regulations will provide benefits by preventing consumers from wasting money on unnecessary
and ineffective dietary supplements. Another comment stated that if someone wanted to waste a little money taking
too many vitamins or supplements in the hope of avoiding serious illness and the need for harsh drugs, they should be
allowed to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because there are sources other than labeling that provide information about the potential uses of dietary supplements,
the agency believes that limiting the use of claims on labels or labeling will be of limited effect in preventing consumers
from purchasing supplements that they erroneously believe will prevent serious illness. However, these regulations
will ensure that the labels of dietary supplements will provide full nutrition labeling to help consumers to maintain
healthy dietary practices, and they will help to ensure that any nutrient content or health claims made in the labeling
of these products are scientifically valid, truthful, and not misleading. For these reasons, these regulations
will provide a significant benefit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Some comments stated that the cost of providing nutrition information on the labels of dietary supplements of
herbs would greatly outweigh any clear public benefit. The comments explained that herbs do not contain significant
amounts of the core nutrients and are not normally consumed for their nutritional value. Therefore, the value to consumers
of including nutrition labeling on herb products is insignificant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees with this comment. However, the agency notes that those products that do not contain significant
amounts of the 14 mandatory nutrients will generally not be required to bear nutrition labeling. Therefore, although
there will be no clear public benefit, there will also be no cost.

D. Summary of the Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the economic implications of the final rules amending on nutrition labeling, nutrient content claims,
and health claims for dietary supplements as required by Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act
(Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity). The Regulatory
Flexibility Act requires analyzing options for regulatory relief for small businesses. FDA finds that these final
rules on dietary supplements, taken together, are not significant as defined by Executive Order 12866. In accordance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that the final rules will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed the comments and has determined that the costs of compliance associated with the 18&hyph;month
compliance period provided by the agency include administrative costs of between $50,000 and $100,000, analytical
costs of between $0 and $33 million, printing and redesign costs of between $6 and $28 million, and label inventory
disposal costs of between $2 and $9 million. Total discounted costs of the final regulations, taken together are between
$8 and $60 million (7 percent discount rate). If the agency did not extend the application of the rules, total discounted
costs would be between $20 and $133 million for a 6-month compliance period, or between $11 and $84 million for a 1-year
compliance period.

The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24 (a)(11) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant impact on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement is required.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its food labeling regulations to establish requirements for the
nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other similar nutritional substances
(hereinafter referred to as dietary supplements). This action is in response to certain provisions of the Nutrition
Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments) and the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 (the DS act).

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33715), FDA published a proposed rule entitled ``Food Labeling; General Requirements for Nutrition
Labeling for Dietary Supplements of Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs, or Other Similar Nutritional Substances'' (hereinafter
identified as ``the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements'') to establish regulations on the nutrition
labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other similar nutritional substances. A document
correcting various editorial errors in that proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40104). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule was issued to implement the 1990 amendments (Pub. L. 101-535), which were signed into law on November
8, 1990. This new law amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) in a number of important ways. One of
the notable aspects of the 1990 amendments is that it added section 403(q) to the act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)). This section
requires that most foods bear nutrition labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to section 403(q) of the act, FDA published a proposed rule on nutrition labeling in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366 at 60393). That document proposed, among other things, a regulation specifically
for the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals (proposed &sect;101.36). It also proposed
to make the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of herbs or other similar nutritional substances subject to
&sect;101.9 (21 CFR 101.9), the general regulation on nutrition labeling. This distinction reflects section 403(q)(5)(F)
(formerly section 403(q)(5)(E)) of the act. This section provides that if a food to which section 411 of the act (21
U.S.C. 350) applies (i.e., a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals) contains one or more of the nutrients required
to be listed in nutrition labeling, ``the label or labeling of such food shall comply with requirements of subparagraph
(1) and (2) [of section 403(q) of the act] in a manner which is appropriate for such food and which is specified in regulations
of the Secretary.'' Other dietary supplements are not subject to section 403(q)(5)(F) of the act and thus are subject
to regulation under section 403(q) of the act as any other food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the proposed rule on nutrition labeling of November 27, 1991, FDA received over 45 responses, each containing
one or more comments, that pertained to the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements. The agency summarized and
discussed the issues in these comments in the preamble of the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule that it issued
on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2079 at 2167). However, the regulations that FDA adopted in that final rule applied only to
the nutrition labeling of foods in conventional food form (&sect;101.9). They did not apply to dietary supplements
because of a moratorium established by the DS act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DS act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;571) was signed into law on October 6, 1992. In section 202(a)(1), the DS act established
a moratorium until December 15, 1993, on the implementation of the 1990 amendments, with respect to dietary supplements.
Thus, FDA did not finalize the proposed rules pertaining to the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins
and minerals (&sect;101.36) or of herbs or other nutritional substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 202(a)(2) of the DS act required that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and by delegation FDA, issue
new proposed regulations that are applicable to dietary supplements no later than June 15, 1993, and final regulations
by December 31, 1993. In response to this provision, FDA issued the June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33715) proposal and is now issuing
this final rule. In addition, elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FDA is issuing final regulations that address the use of nutrient content claims and health claims on dietary supplements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 203 of the DS act instructed FDA not to promulgate regulations before November 8, 1993, that establish
recommended daily allowances for vitamins or minerals other than those recommended allowances specified in &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv)
as in effect on October 6, 1992. Therefore, in the January 6, 1993, mandatory nutrition labeling final rule, FDA retained
the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances (U.S. RDA) values specified in &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv), as in effect on October
6, 1992. These U.S. RDA values were in large measure based on the RDA's in the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) publication
``Recommended Dietary Allowances,'' 7th edition, 1968 (Ref. 1). The agency did, however, change the terminology
for these values from ``U.S. RDA's'' to ``Reference Daily Intakes (RDI's).''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received over 400 responses to its June 18, 1993, proposed rule on the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements,
each of these responses contained one or more comments. Responses were received from consumers, consumer advocacy
organizations, health care professionals, professional societies, universities, industry, trade associations,
and State and local governments. Many comments addressed issues covered by other proposals that are a part of this
overall food labeling initiative, and they will be addressed in those documents. Other comments were outside the
scope of these proposals and will not be discussed here. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
About half of the comments supported the proposal; about half of these comments supported it without modification.
These comments were primarily from health professionals, although a few were from that segment of the food industry
that produces foods in conventional food form. The remainder of the comments that supported the proposal suggested
modifications in various provisions of the proposal. About half of the comments opposed the proposal. These comments
were primarily from consumers who opposed FDA's regulation of dietary supplements. A summary of the comments that
suggested changes and the agency's responses follow:

II. Scope of New &sect;101.36
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. One comment from a manufacturer of dietary supplements supported the proposed rule to allow only vitamins and minerals
that have RDI's or Daily Reference Values (DRV's) to be listed in the nutrition label of dietary supplements of vitamins
and minerals. However, several comments wanted non-RDI vitamins and minerals to be listed, particularly those in
the NAS's ``Recommended Dietary Allowances'' (i.e., chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, selenium,
and vitamin K). The comments pointed out that advances in scientific knowledge have shown that these nutrients are
considered essential to human health. Some comments also suggested listing nutrients such as arsenic, boron, silicon,
tin, and vanadium that they stated are of major significance in human nutrition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of these comments suggested that an asterisk in the ``Percent Daily Value'' column could refer to a footnote,
such as ``No Daily Value has been established for this nutrient.'' Another comment suggested that these additional
nutrients could be listed in a subsection of the nutrition panel below the bar after the last nutrient for which there
is an RDI or DRV. One comment stated that to put information on nutrients of this type outside of the ``Nutrition Facts''
box would be inconvenient and may cause some consumers to overlook the presence of these additional nutrients, some
of which should not be consumed in excess.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency is persuaded that it is appropriate to allow the nutrients that are listed as being essential to humans in
the NAS's ``Recommended Dietary Allowances'' (Refs. 2 and 10), but for which FDA has not established RDI's, to be declared
in the nutrition label of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals when they are present in supplements at more
than insignificant amounts. The agency agrees that there have been significant advances in scientific knowledge
with respect to essential nutrient requirements since 1968. In 1989, the NAS updated its RDA's to include values for
vitamin K and selenium and to make significant revisions in the allowances for several nutrients including vitamin
B6, folate (folic acid), vitamin B12, magnesium, iron and zinc (Ref. 2). In addition, scientific advances permitted
the NAS to revise the values, known as ``Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary Intakes'' (ESADDI's) in 1980 for
chloride (Ref. 10) and in 1989, for three nutrients (biotin, pantothenic acid, and copper), for which FDA established
U.S. RDA's in 1973, and to establish new ESADDI's for manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum (Ref. 2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was in response to these scientific advances that FDA proposed RDI's in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366 at 60390 and 60393) for the nutrients mentioned previously that are included in the
1980 and the 1989 NAS RDA's but for which RDI's have not been established (i.e., chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese,
molybdenum, selenium, and vitamin K). The establishment of RDI's would have allowed these nutrients to be listed
on the nutrition label of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals as well of foods in conventional food form.
However, as stated above, section 203 of the DS act instructed FDA not to promulgate regulations that require the use
of, or that are based upon, recommended daily allowances of vitamins or minerals before November 8, 1993, other than
those specified in &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv), as in effect on October 6, 1992. In accordance with this provision of the
DS act, the agency issued a final rule on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2206) that retained the former U.S. RDA values. As a result,
the final rule did not include RDI's for chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, and vitamin
K.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the prohibition in section 203 of the DS act has now expired, the agency is proposing, elsewhere in this issue
of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, to establish RDI values for those nutrients listed by the NAS as being essential to humans and that do not already have
RDI values. The agency is proposing this action because these nutrients are essential for the maintenance of good
health in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recognition of the essentiality of these nutrients and in response to the comments summarized above, the agency
is requiring in new &sect;101.36(b)(3) that chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, selenium and
vitamin K be included in the nutrition label when present in the dietary supplement. The agency also is providing in
&sect;101.36(b)(4)(vi) that if any of these nutrients are declared, they are to be followed by an asterisk in the ``Percent
Daily Value'' column. The asterisk is to refer to another asterisk that is placed at the bottom of the table and that
is followed by the statement ``Daily Value not established.'' This action is a logical outgrowth of the nutrition
labeling proposal for dietary supplements because that proposal put into issue the question of whether the list of
nutrients that FDA proposed be included in the nutrition label under &sect; 101.36 was the appropriate list. The comments
have persuaded FDA that the list needs to be expanded in the manner described in this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not persuaded, however, that other trace elements for which the NAS has not established RDA's or ESADDI's should
be declared within the nutrition label. The comments that suggested that such elements be included on the label provided
some published reports that certain of these elements have been found to be essential in the diets of various animals
but did not provide sufficient evidence for the agency to conclude that there is scientific consensus about their
essentiality for the maintenance of good health in humans. The agency strongly believes that evidence of the usefulness
of a nutrient for humans is necessary before that nutrient can be allowed to be listed within the nutrition label. This
policy is consistent with current &sect;101.9(i)(5) (redesignated and revised in the January 6, 1993, final rules,
as &sect;101.9(k)(5)) which prohibits a food's label from stating or implying that the food has special dietary properties
because of the presence of a substance when, in fact, the usefulness of the substance has not been established in human
nutrition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in its proposed rule on mandatory nutrition labeling (55 FR 29487 at 29493, July 19, 1990), FDA stated
that it was concerned about the possibility of a large number of nutrients being listed in nutrition labeling and about
the way in which their presence on the label may be interpreted by consumers. FDA expressed concern that the presence
of a large number of nutrients could be misinterpreted as implying that a food has a greater public health significance
than may be the case. The potential for this happening and misleading the consumer about the contribution of the food
to human nutrition is especially likely if the nutrition label were to include nutrients not known to be important
to humans. Therefore, FDA believes that foods that list such nutrients in the nutrition label would be misbranded
under section 403(a) of the act which prohibits misleading information on the labels and labeling of foods. However,
statements about amounts and percentages can be made outside of the nutrition label as discussed in the final rule
on nutrient content claims published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is specifying that the new nutrients to be listed appear in an order that reflects the order that FDA proposed
in the nutrition labeling proposal of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60390). Vitamin K is to be listed after vitamin E with
the fat soluble vitamins, selenium is to be listed before copper, and the remaining nutrients (manganese, fluoride,
chromium, molybdenum, and chloride) are to be listed after copper at the bottom of the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency points out that it is not allowing the listing of these nutrients on the nutrition labels of foods in conventional
food form. Under &sect;101.9(c)(8), quantitative amounts by weight of vitamins and minerals are not listed within
the nutrition label of foods in conventional food form. As a result, the listing of only an asterisk in conjunction
with the statement ``Daily Value not established'' would provide consumers with no indication of the amount of chloride,
chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, selenium and vitamin K present in the food. Therefore, FDA has not provided
in &sect;101.9 for a provision comparable to that in &sect;101.36(b)(3) and (b)(4) that allows for the placement
of these nutrients on the nutrition label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA wishes to point out that &sect;101.36(a) only requires the label of a dietary supplement of a vitamin or mineral
to bear nutrition labeling in accordance with the provisions of &sect;101.36 if the vitamins or minerals in the supplement
have an RDI or DRV. Accordingly, dietary supplements containing only chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese,
molybdenum, selenium, or vitamin K need not adhere to &sect;101.36 until such time as RDI's are established for them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A couple of comments said that nutrients such as fat and sodium should not be required to be declared in the nutrition
labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals. One of these comments said that dietary supplements are
not taken because of their fat or sodium levels, and that these substances should not be declared. Other comments specifically
supported the proposed rule in requiring that nutrients of this type be declared when they are present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is not persuaded that nutrients such as fat and sodium should not be declared in the nutrition labeling of
dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals when present in significant amounts. The majority of the comments supported
FDA's view that this information is needed to fully inform consumers of the nutrient content of these products. Although
dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals are not consumed because of their fat or sodium levels, this type of information
on products that contain significant levels of such nutrients will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary
practices. Therefore, the agency is not making the requested change in the regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A few comments stated that dietary supplements of herbs and of other nutritional substances should be labeled under
&sect;101.36. One of these comments said it would be less confusing if all supplements were labeled in the same manner.
Other comments agreed that dietary supplements of herbs should be labeled in accordance with &sect;101.9 for foods
in conventional food form. However, at least one comment requested that dietary supplements of herbs be exempt from
declaring the ``core'' nutrients if they have to be labeled in accordance with &sect;101.9, and another comment said
that these dietary supplements should not have to list ``Percent Daily Values.'' At least one comment stated that
dietary supplements of herbs should have their own format for nutrition labeling, and a few other comments requested
that dietary supplements of herbs be exempt from all nutrition labeling. One of these comments agreed that FDA did
not have the authority to exempt dietary supplements of herbs from &sect;101.9 and wanted an amendment to the 1990
amendments that would exempt these dietary supplements from nutrition labeling. This comment said that dietary
supplements of herbs are not normally consumed for their nutritive value, and that nutrition labeling on these products
is irrelevant and unimportant to consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33716, June 18, 1993), the
difference in the labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals and of dietary supplements of herbs and
of other similar nutritional substances is a result of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the act. As stated above, this section
provides that if a food to which section 411 of the act applies (i.e., a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals)
contains one or more of the nutrients required to be listed in nutrition labeling, the label or labeling of such food
is to comply with the requirements of section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2) of the act in a manner that FDA determines, by regulation,
is appropriate for such food. Other dietary supplements are not subject to section 403(q)(5)(F) of the act and thus
are subject to regulation under section 403(q) of the act in the same manner as any other food. There is nothing in the
1990 amendments, or elsewhere in the act, that would allow the agency to exempt the broad category of dietary supplements
of herbs and of other similar nutritional substances from section 403(q)(1) and (q)(2) of the act. Thus, supplements
that are not dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals are appropriately subject to nutrition labeling under
&sect;101.9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;101.9, the nutrition label of dietary supplements of herbs and of other similar nutritional substances
may be presented in either a full or simplified format as specified in &sect;101.9(d) or (f). The simplified format
in &sect;101.9(f) may be used when a supplement of herbs or of other similar nutritional substances contains insignificant
amounts of seven or more of the following nutrients: Calories, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, total
carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, and iron. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not persuaded that nutrition labels on dietary supplements of herbs using the simplified format should be exempt
from the requirement to declare the ``core'' nutrients (i.e., calories, total fat, sodium, total carbohydrate,
and protein). The agency has stated its belief in the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule (58 FR 2079 at 2142) that
this core information is essential to aid consumers in learning about the relative nutritional qualities of all foods,
and the information allows consumers to judge the consequences of the food selections they make. No new information
was presented in the comments to change FDA's position on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also advises that &sect;101.9(j)(4) provides that foods subject to &sect;101.9, including dietary supplements
of herbs and of other similar nutritional substances, are exempt from nutrition labeling requirements when all of
the nutrients required to be declared under &sect;101.9(c) are absent or are present in insignificant amounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also not persuaded that nutrition labels on supplements of herbs should be excused from listing ``Percent Daily
Values.'' As called for in section 2(b)(1)(A) of the 1990 amendments, a primary purpose of the nutrition label is to
help consumers make informed food choices by enabling them to both comprehend the nutritional value of the food and
to understand its relative significance in the context of the total daily diet. The consumer research that the agency
reviewed in the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule supports FDA's assertion that the listing of percent Daily
Value improves consumers' abilities to make correct dietary judgments about a food in the context of a total daily
diet (58 FR 2079 at 2125). In part, this improved ability to make judgments is achieved by the use of a consistent system
of percentages, so that virtually all the nutrients on the label can be declared in equivalent units. Also, the percentages
communicate information about the nutrient level in a food without the consumer having to be concerned about the absolute
level or units of the underlying scale being used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for the reasons stated, the agency has not acceded to the requests that dietary supplements of herbs and
of other similar nutritional substances be labeled under &sect;101.36, have their own format for nutrition labeling,
be exempt from all nutrition labeling, or be exempt from declaring the ``core'' nutrients and the ``Percent Daily
Values'' in &sect;101.9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. One comment requested that the language of &sect;&sect;101.36(a) and 101.9(j)(6) be revised to refer to ``dietary
supplements that are represented as a source of vitamins and minerals,'' instead of ``dietary supplements of vitamins
and minerals.'' This comment was concerned that alfalfa tablets that have calcium as a binder would be required to
be labeled under &sect;101.36. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency would like to make clear that it does not consider a product that contains a substance that is a vitamin or
a mineral, but that is used in the food solely for technological purposes, to be a dietary supplement of a vitamin or
mineral because of the presence of that substance. In these circumstances, the product would not be represented as
supplying a vitamin or mineral (see section 411(c) of the act). Thus, alfalfa tablets that have calcium as a binder
would be required to be labeled under &sect;101.9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A few comments requested clarification of the type of nutrition labeling that would be required for ``combination''
products that contain herbs with added vitamins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency advises that the type of nutrition labeling that would be required for products that contain herbs and added
vitamins would depend upon the contents of the product as well as how the product is represented. If a ``combination''
product is primarily a dietary supplement of vitamins and minerals and is marketed as such, the product would have
to be labeled in accordance with &sect;101.36. If the product is not primarily a dietary supplement of vitamins or
minerals and is not represented as such, it would have to be labeled in accordance with &sect;101.9. The agency believes
that the manufacturer makes the determination as to whether a product is primarily a dietary supplement of an herb,
of vitamins or minerals, or of a ``similar nutritional substance'' based on how it labels and formulates the product.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The types of claims that are made on a dietary supplement will both determine, and be limited by, whether it is a dietary
supplement of vitamins or minerals or of herbs or of other nutritional substances. Section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act
states that the labeling and advertising for dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals may not give prominence
to or emphasize ingredients that are not vitamins, minerals, or represented as a source of vitamins or minerals. Thus,
if, for example, a dietary supplement of an herbal extract adds vitamins and minerals yet remains primarily a dietary
supplement of the herbal extract and is advertised as such, section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act would not apply to the product.
This would be the case when the label of such a product made no reference to any added vitamins or minerals other than
in the ingredient list and nutrition label. Section 411(b)(2)(B) is discussed in more detail in the companion document
on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements, which is published elsewhere in this issue of the

 6. One comment requested that the language of &sect;101.36(a) be revised to delete ``and labeling.'' The comment
says that nutrition labeling is not required on labeling under &sect;101.9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees with this comment and is revising the first sentence of &sect;101.36(a) to delete the words ``and
labeling,'' thereby requiring that the required nutrition information appear on the label of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals. FDA notes that &sect;101.9(a)(2) allows the required nutrition information to be placed
on labeling of foods in conventional food form when such foods are not in packaged form. The types of labeling that are
identified in &sect;101.9(a)(2) and that allow the required information to be clearly displayed at the point of purchase
are counter cards, signs, tags affixed to the product, booklets, looseleaf binders, and other appropriate devices.
The only manner in which the agency envisions that dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals would not be sold in
packaged form is when they would be sold directly from bulk containers. If and when dietary supplements of vitamins
and minerals are sold in this manner, &sect;101.36(g) specifically provides that they are subject to the special
labeling provisions in &sect;101.9(j)(16) for foods sold from bulk containers. Section 101.9(j)(16) allows for
the required nutrition information to be displayed to consumers either on the labeling of the bulk container plainly
in view or in accordance with &sect;101.9(a)(2).

A. Serving Size Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. At least one comment stated that information on serving size is not needed because it is given in the directions for
use. Other comments supported the proposed rule stating that serving size information should be declared in the nutrition
label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that information on serving size is as essential on the nutrition label of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals as it is on that of foods in conventional food form. First, this information may not be given
in the directions. For instance, the directions may state ``take 3 tablets a day'' without indicating if they are to
be taken at one setting as one serving or spread out throughout the day in three separate servings. Thus, it is fair to
conclude that in many instances the serving size will not be duplicative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, this information quickly informs the consumer about the amount of the product that contains the levels
of nutrients declared. It also provides a degree of consistency between the nutrition labels of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals and those of foods in conventional food form. FDA concluded in the mandatory nutrition labeling
final rule that if the nutrition label was to be readily observable and comprehensible, it must be presented in as consistent
a manner as possible from label to label (58 FR 2079 at 2136 and 2139). This consistent look to the required nutrition
information on packages of both dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals and foods in conventional food form
will help consumers to find and recognize the information. Consistent treatment is important for the effective use
of the nutrition label by consumers. As a result, the agency is not changing &sect;101.36 to delete the requirement
for serving size information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. One comment stated that the reference amounts for dietary supplements should be specified in absolute terms but
did not provide any data. The comment argued that absolute amounts are needed so that if comparative claims are made,
one product recommending consumption of, for example, one tablespoon per day is not compared to a product recommending
five tablespoons per day. A few other comments supported the proposed definition for reference amounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has defined the reference amount customarily consumed for a dietary supplement in &sect;101.12(b) as
``the maximum amount recommended on the label for consumption per eating occasion or, in the absence of recommendations,
one tablet, capsule, packet, or teaspoonful, as appropriate.'' As discussed in the nutrition labeling proposal
on dietary supplements (54 FR 33715 at 33716), the agency relied upon labeling recommendations in this definition
because it believed that consumption is determined in large part by the amount recommended on the label of these products,
and it lacked the data to specify absolute amounts. The agency requested comments on this approach in the proposal.
No comments provided data for the agency to use in determining absolute amounts that could be used as reference amounts.
Therefore, the reference amount for dietary supplements will continue to be based on labeling recommendations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency does not agree with the comment that absolute amounts are needed to prevent a product with a 1 tablespoon
serving from being compared to a product with a 5 tablespoon serving. Lacking data to the contrary, the agency must
assume that the recommended amount on the label is the amount customarily consumed. Based on that assumption, it is
consistent with &sect;101.13, General Principles for Nutrient Content Claims, which provides for comparative
claims to be based on reference amounts customarily consumed. This topic as it relates to comparative claims is further
discussed in the companion document on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements, published elsewhere in
this issue of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 9. A few comments stated that the term ``Serving Size'' is confusing on dietary supplements. A few comments had questions
about the determination of serving size, and one of these comments requested that the term ``Recommended Intake''
be used instead of the term ``Serving Size.'' Another comment suggested that the term ``Minimum Recommended Serving
Size'' be used when the label directions specify a range of possible intakes for a product (e.g., two to three tablets
per day). This comment was concerned that ``someone reading only the nutritional information portion of the label
will think that the serving amount listed there is the recommended amount when it is really the maximum recommended
amount.'' Other comments disagreed with this position and supported the proposed rule which stated that the serving
size should refer to the maximum amount when a range is specified for a product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked what the serving size is when the label recommends one to four tablets per day. This comment also asked
about serving size when the label recommends two tablets a day. Another comment supported the statement in the proposal
that if there is no amount recommended on the label, the serving size is one unit of the supplement. This comment observed
that the issue arises as to how a determination can be made of ``servings per container'' if there is no recommendation
as to serving size. The comment stated that this issue needs to be considered to avoid a regulatory gap.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is not persuaded that a term other than ``serving size'' should be used to describe the basis for nutrient
declaration for dietary supplements. It would be confusing for consumers if dietary supplements of vitamins and
minerals used a term such as ``Recommended Intake'' and other foods used the term ``Serving Size.'' As discussed in
the nutrition labeling proposal on dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33716), the agency proposed that the nutrition
labeling of vitamin or mineral supplements be presented in a manner that is as similar as possible to the nutrition
labeling of other foods. The agency believes that use of the same term on all labels will help to avoid confusion. As
use of the new nutrition label becomes more widespread, and consumers become familiar with it, they will come to understand
that the serving size represents the amount of product that they are likely to consume in one eating occasion. Thus,
they will come to understand that for a dietary supplement, the serving size represents the amount of that product
that they are likely to consume at those times that they decide to take the supplement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the proposal of June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33715 at 33716), the agency believes that it is more useful for consumers
to have the serving size be based on the maximum amount recommended, and to have the nutrition information be reported
on this basis, than to have serving size be based on the minimum or the average amount. However, in some cases, the serving
size is the same regardless of whether the maximum or minimum amount is used. For example, if label directions recommend
a range of one to three tablets per day, the serving size is one tablet based on the fact that there are three separate
eating occasions per day. If label directions recommend a range of one to four tablets per day, the serving size is also
one tablet given the rounding rules (i.e., four divided by three, rounded off to one). As for the question what is the
serving size if the label recommends two tablets per day, the serving size would also be one tablet because of rounding.
In the absence of recommendations on the label, a serving size of one unit is appropriate for determining the ``Serving
Size'' and the ``Servings Per Container.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 When the serving is one unit, the number of servings per container would duplicate the number of units declared on the
principal display panel. To avoid redundancy the agency is providing in &sect;101.36(b)(2), as proposed, that information
on servings per container need not be provided when the identical information is stated in the net quantity of contents
declaration. However, dietary supplements in liquid or powdered form will have to declare ``Servings Per Container''
because the net quantity of contents information will be reported in net volume or net weight measures, such as fluid
ounces or grams (g), while the serving size will be expressed in common household measures, such as teaspoonfuls.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, the agency has reexamined the proposed rule with respect to these comments on serving size and believes
that no changes are needed.

B. ``Amount Per Serving''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. A few comments stated that nutrition information should not be reported on the basis of ``per serving.'' These
comments requested that the heading ``Amount Per Serving'' be replaced by the term ``Amount Per Day'' or by the terms
``Amount Per Tablet'' or ``Each Tablet Contains.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency does not agree with the comment that nutrition information should be reported as ``amount per day.'' As
explained in the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33717), the agency proposed
in the November 27, 1991, document (56 FR 60366 at 60383) that nutrition information be presented under the heading
of ``Per Unit,'' but that when label directions specified that more than one unit be consumed during a day, it also be
presented under the heading of ``Per Day'' (i.e., dual declaration). The agency proposed dual declaration when more
than one unit was to be consumed per day to more fully inform consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency received a number of comments opposing the dual declaration of nutrition information on supplements.
Some of these comments supported declaration on the basis of ``per day'' because they believed that it is the total
daily amount of nutrients that is important. Other comments favored a ``per unit'' basis because some consumers may
deviate from the recommended intake, or the intake may be presented as a range. In the preamble of the mandatory nutrition
labeling final rule of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2079 at 2168), the agency stated that dual declaration may create a readability
problem for consumers, and that in general a ``per unit'' approach was more useful than a ``per day'' approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33717), however, the agency took a different
approach. It stated that it had tentatively concluded that declaration on the basis of ``per serving'' is preferable
because reporting information solely on a ``per unit'' basis could confuse consumers when more that one unit is to
be consumed at one time (e.g., two capsules with each meal). The agency expressed concern that if consumers do not notice
or do not understand the heading that states ``per unit,'' they might assume that the information is for the amount
specified for consumption at one time (i.e., ``per serving''), particularly because information for foods in conventional
food form is expressed on a ``per serving'' basis. Furthermore, the agency tentatively concluded that consistency
with the labeling of foods in conventional food form in this regard is the best approach because it will reduce consumer
confusion (58 FR 33715 at 33717). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inasmuch as most of the comments supported the proposed rule on this issue, and comments opposing did not provide any
information demonstrating that there is enhanced consumer understanding or ease of use when information is expressed
on a daily basis, the agency is not changing &sect;101.36(b)(3) in response to these comments. FDA has reconsidered
its position in response to comments requesting use of the terms ``Amount Per Tablet'' and ``Each Tablet Contains,''
however, in light of the comments. The agency concludes that where the serving size is one tablet, there is little,
if any, chance for misunderstanding if either of these terms is used in place of the term ``Amount Per Serving.'' Therefore,
the agency is revising &sect;101.36(b)(3) to state that when the serving size of the product is one unit, a heading
consistent with the declaration of serving size, such as ``Amount per Tablet'' or ``Each Tablet Contains,'' may be
used in lieu of ``Amount Per Serving.'' Other appropriate terms, such as ``capsule,'' ``packet,'' or ``teaspoonful,''
may be used in place of the term ``Serving.'' While a consistent change in &sect;101.9(d)(4) appears reasonable,
FDA believes that it is necessary to address such a change through notice-and-comment rulemaking. The agency intends
to propose such a change in the near future.

1. Listing of Nutrient Names and Amounts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Several comments recommended that information on the quantitative amount by weight for the nutrients listed
should be presented in a separate column, rather than immediately following nutrient names. These comments stated
that some consumers buy on the basis of amounts, using them to make product comparisons, and that separate columns
would help consumers to more readily locate this information. An additional comment requested that information
on amounts be presented either in a separate column or after the ``Percent Daily Value'' in parenthesis. On the other
hand, several comments supported the proposed rule, arguing that the format for dietary supplements of vitamins
or minerals should follow the format for foods in conventional food form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency disagrees with the recommendation that information on the quantitative amount by weight for the nutrients
listed should be presented in a separate column. The agency observes that space on the label is conserved by not requiring
a separate column. Furthermore, FDA believes that the comprehensibility of this information will be enhanced when
it is presented immediately next to the name of the nutrient. As discussed in the mandatory nutrition labeling final
rule (58 FR 2079 at 2117), multiple column nutrient information displays are much more difficult than single column
displays for consumers to use for product comparisons. Both FDA's first experimental format study and the major industry
format study found that declaring nutrient amounts per serving in adjacent columns of grams per milligram (g/mg)
amounts and percent Daily Value led consumers to make more mistakes and to take longer on the product comparison type
of task (Refs. 3 and 4). FDA's second experimental study, however, showed that when g/mg nutrient amount information
was placed immediately next to the nutrient name in an unordered array, and percents were placed in a column array,
the adverse effects on product comparison performance disappeared (Ref. 5). Thus, the agency is requiring in &sect;101.36(b)(3)
that the name of each nutrient listed shall be immediately followed by the quantitative amount by weight of the nutrient,
to be consistent with &sect;101.9(d)(7)(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. A few comments requested that only the calcium portion of calcium gluconate be listed in the nutrition panel and
on the principal display panel. Similarly, another comment requested that the agency clarify that vitamin B6 refers
to pyridoxine, not pyridoxine hydrochloride.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency wishes to emphasize that the declaration of the quantitative amount by weight in the nutrition label is
to indicate the weight of a particular nutrient and not the weight of the salt of that nutrient used to make the supplement.
For example, only the calcium portion of calcium gluconate is to be declared in the nutrition label, although in some
circumstances the weight of the whole substance may appear on the principal display panel if it clearly refers to the
whole substance, such as when the statement of identity states ``calcium gluconate, 600 mg.'' Similarly, only the
pyridoxine portion of pyridoxine hydrochloride is to be declared in the nutrition label. The agency believes that
no changes in &sect;101.36 are necessary based on these comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. One comment recommended that biotin and folate be declared in terms of micrograms (&mu;g), not mg, and that calcium
and phosphorus be declared in terms of mg, not g. The comment stated that consumers are more familiar with these nutrients
being expressed in this manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA proposed on July 19, 1990 (56 FR 29476) to change to the units suggested in this comment. However, section 203 of
the DS act prohibited FDA from adopting any reference values for vitamins and minerals different from the U.S. RDA's
contained in &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv), as in effect on October 6, 1992, until after November 8, 1993. Accordingly,
FDA adopted those U.S. RDA values as the RDI's, with biotin and folate expressed in terms of mg and calcium and phosphorus
expressed in terms of g. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the prohibition in section 203 of the DS Act has now expired, the agency is proposing elsewhere in this issue of
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to amend &sect;101.9 to change the units of declaration for biotin and folate to &mu;g and for calcium and phosphorus
to mg. This proposal responds fully to the comment. 14. One comment was opposed to the agency's proposal, in &sect;101.36(b)(3),
to allow amounts of protein below 1 g to be left off the nutrition label. This comment requested that such amounts of
protein be declared because individuals who are highly sensitive to monosodium glutamate (MSG) may have adverse
reactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has recognized that certain individuals are sensitive to MSG and believes that the appropriate means to convey
the presence of this ingredient to consumers is by use of the ingredient statement because MSG is a food ingredient.
The agency reiterates that dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals are required to comply with &sect;101.4
(21 CFR 101.4), which requires full ingredient labeling of food. Furthermore, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1993, the agency proposed changes in the regulations pertaining to ingredient labeling to accommodate
those individuals who are sensitive to MSG. Proposed &sect;101.22 (58 FR 2950) would require that when the amount
of free glutamate in hydrolyzed protein reaches a specified level, the declaration in the ingredient statement must
include the parenthetical ``(contains glutamate).''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reexamined proposed &sect;101.36 in response to this comment and notes that there is an inconsistency
in the labeling of protein, total carbohydrate, and dietary fiber between &sect;101.9 and proposed &sect;101.36.
For example, 0.5 g to 0.99 g of these substances in a dietary supplement of a vitamin or mineral would not be declared
under proposed &sect;101.36(b)(3), yet these amounts in a food in conventional food form would be declared either
as ``1 g'' or ``less than 1 g'' under &sect;101.9(c). To correct this inconsistency, the agency is modifying &sect;101.36(b)(3)
to provide that amounts of nutrients that can be declared as zero in the nutrition label of foods in conventional food
form shall not be declared in the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals. Thus, the agency
is requiring the declaration of protein, as well as total carbohydrate and dietary fiber, when they are present in
amounts of 0.5 g to 1 g. Amounts under 0.5 g would continue to not be listed in the nutrition label of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals, because these amounts would allow a declaration of zero in the nutrition labeling of foods
in conventional form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. One comment recommended that ``active'' ingredients present at less than 2 percent of the Daily Value be allowed
to be listed in the nutrition label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is not allowing vitamins and minerals (except sodium and potassium, which are not included in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv))
present at less than 2 percent of the Daily Value to be listed because the declaration of such amounts would be misleading.
Such values are insignificant under &sect;101.9(f) and may be declared as 0 percent of the RDI in the nutrition labeling
of foods in conventional food form. They are amounts that are dietetically trivial and physiologically inconsequential.
In addition, FDA is concerned that some consumers will be misled by the mere presence of names of nutrients within the
nutrition label, because they would assume that products with more nutrients listed have a greater public health
significance than those with less, regardless of the amount of each nutrient present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is unaware of any reason, nor does the comment present any reason, for allowing the declaration of nutrients
that are present in such small amounts. Thus, the agency is making no change in response to this comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. One comment requested that FDA revise &sect;101.36(b)(3)(i) to more clearly state the increments to be used for
expressing the quantitative amounts by weight of vitamins and minerals. Another comment stated that amounts should
not be rounded. This comment stated, ``We really see no reason why products should not be formulated to contain the
amounts stated on the label, subject to reasonable overages based on shelf-life considerations and the like and reasonable
analytical variation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency inadvertently did not address the increments to be used for expressing the quantitative amounts by weight
of vitamins and minerals. Proposed &sect;101.36(b)(3)(i) stated that amounts of vitamins and minerals are to be
expressed in the increments specified in &sect;101.9(c) using the units of measure and the level of significance
given in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv), except that zeros following decimal points may be dropped. While the agency is adopting
this rule, FDA recognizes that, as the comment points out, &sect;101.9(c) does not address the question of the increments
in which the quantitative amounts of vitamins and minerals are to be declared because in the nutrition labeling of
foods in conventional food form, vitamins, and minerals are declared only as a percentage of the Daily Value. The quantitative
amounts by weight of these nutrients, except for potassium and sodium, which are considered electrolytes, are not
required in the nutrition label of conventional foods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has considered this issue and notes that dietary supplements, unlike most foods in conventional food form,
are fabricated to contain specific amounts of vitamins and minerals. It is for this reason that the vitamins and minerals
in dietary supplements are categorized as Class I nutrients, and that under &sect;101.9(g)(4), a food is misbranded
if it contains less of an added vitamin or mineral than the amount declared on the label. In view of how dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals are made, the agency agrees that it makes no sense to permit the amounts of vitamins and minerals
in such products to be rounded and declared only in specified increments. Therefore, the agency has modified &sect;101.36(b)(3)(i)
to provide that the actual amounts of vitamins and minerals in the supplement are to be declared using the units of measure
specified in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv), except that zeros following decimal points may be dropped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 With respect to levels of significance, that is, the number of decimal places used in declaring amounts, the agency
proposed that only the levels of significance shown in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv) could be presented. In some cases,
however, the number of decimal places allowed is not sufficient to express actual amounts of certain vitamins and
minerals because the amounts are very small. For example, a product that contains 10 percent of the Daily Value for
copper would contain 0.2 mg of copper. If the amount of copper had to be expressed using the same level of significance
as that used in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv) for expressing its RDI (i.e., 2 mg), the lowest amount that could be declared
would be 1 mg, which would be inaccurately high.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that amounts of vitamins and minerals that have nutritional significance can be declared, the agency is
modifying &sect;101.36(b)(3)(i) to provide that amounts shall be expressed in the increments specified in &sect;101.9(c),
except that additional levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient
to express lower amounts (e.g., the RDI for copper is given in whole mg, but the quantitative amount may be declared
in tenths of a mg). Additionally, the agency is modifying &sect;101.36(b)(3)(i) to describe how amounts of the nutrients
from NAS' 9th and 10th editions (Refs. 2 and 10) for which RDI's have not been established are to be declared. Amounts
for chloride, fluoride, and manganese shall be expressed in mg, and amounts for chromium, molybdenum, selenium,
and vitamin K shall be expressed in &mu;g. These values shall be expressed in whole numbers, except that tenths may
be used for fluoride. These values reflect the amounts in which the RDI's or EASDDL's for these nutrients are given
(Refs. 2 and 10). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. One comment stated there was an apparent inconsistency between the requirement in &sect;101.36(b)(3)(ii) that
nutrients ``be listed in the order specified in &sect;101.9(c) except that calcium and iron, when present, should
be grouped with other minerals,'' and the sequence of vitamin D and vitamin E in the examples provided in &sect;101.36(c)(8).
The comment recommended that the appropriate order of nutrients be clarified in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While FDA finds no inconsistency with the sequence of vitamin D and vitamin E in the sample labels provided in &sect;101.36(c)(8),
the agency points out that there was an error in the order of nutrients in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2227). FDA published a correction in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 1, 1993 (58 FR 17104), which listed the order as follows: Vitamin A, vitamin C, calcium, iron, vitamin D, vitamin
E, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, phosphorus, iodine,
magnesium, zinc, and copper. This order is the one used by FDA in the June 18, 1993, proposal on nutrition labeling of
dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals, except that calcium and iron were listed with the minerals, following
pantothenic acid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency wishes to make these regulations as clear as possible. Therefore, in response to the comment's request
for clarification of the appropriate order of nutrients, and to make clear where in the list to include the nutrients
that have no RDI but that are required to be included in the nutrition label on dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals
when they are present, FDA is revising &sect;101.36(b)(3)(ii) to specify the exact order in which vitamins and minerals
are to be declared (see section II. comment 1. of this document). Any nutrients not present in the supplement, or present
at insignificant levels, must be omitted from the list.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 18. At least one comment requested that vitamins be listed in alphabetical order. Another comment requested that
calcium and magnesium be the first minerals to be listed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has not accepted these suggestions. As discussed in the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements
(58 FR 33719), with the exception of calcium and iron, FDA proposed in &sect;101.36(b)(3)(ii) that nutrients declared
in the nutrition labeling of vitamin or mineral supplements be listed in the order that nutrients are listed in the
nutrition labeling of foods in conventional food form. The agency proposed that calcium and iron be listed after the
listing of any vitamins that are present so that all of the vitamins will be grouped together. While vitamin A and vitamin
C are to be listed first, consistent with &sect;101.9(c), they are then followed by the fat-soluble vitamins, then
the water-soluble vitamins and the minerals. The NAS in its RDA publications has traditionally grouped the fat-soluble
vitamins ahead of the water-soluble vitamins. The agency notes that this order is followed on the labels of many vitamin
supplements in the marketplace. The comment requesting alphabetical order gave no convincing justification for
following a different order, and, thus, FDA is not changing the order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the comment requesting that calcium and magnesium be the first minerals to be listed presented no reason
for the agency to make this change. Calcium and iron are required to be the first minerals listed on the labels of foods
in conventional food form. In the absence of any reason for why calcium and magnesium should be the first minerals to
be declared on the labels of supplements of vitamins and minerals, the agency is making no change in the order for minerals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. One comment requested that &sect;101.36(b)(3)(ii) be revised to require that potassium be listed with the other
minerals, preferably last on the list. This comment and others expressed confusion about whether potassium could
be listed and requested clarification. One comment requested that &sect;101.36(b)(3) be clarified to allow for
the voluntary listing of potassium in dietary supplements because, according to the comment, potassium is usually
present at less than 100 mg per tablet, primarily because of existing FDA restrictions on potassium salt preparations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that the listing of potassium needs clarification. Potassium is not required to be listed on the
nutrition label of foods in conventional food form. However, it can be listed voluntarily, and when it is, it is to be
listed under sodium, as an electrolyte rather than with the minerals. In contrast, the agency proposed that potassium
be required to be listed on the nutrition label of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals when present in supplements
at more than insignificant amounts (i.e., 5 mg and above), consistent with the listing of other vitamins and minerals.
The agency knows of no reason why potassium in supplements of vitamins and minerals should be treated differently
from other vitamins and minerals in these products, and the comment did not provide a reason for why the listing of potassium
should be voluntary rather than mandatory. Therefore, the agency is not making this change. However, the agency is
modifying the language of &sect;101.36(b)(3) to make it clear that the declaration of potassium is required when
it is present at more than insignificant amounts. To this end, FDA has revised the second sentence of &sect;101.36(b)(3)
to state: ``In addition, potassium * * * shall be declared, except when present at an amount that allows a declaration
of zero * * *. ''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the placement of potassium within the nutrition label, FDA agrees with the comment that the regulation
should be modified. The proposal stated that nutrients that are present shall be listed in the order specified in &sect;101.9(c),
which would mean that potassium, as well as sodium, would precede the listing of any other vitamins or minerals present
in a supplement. FDA has concluded that it is not appropriate and might confuse consumers to have the declaration of
potassium, as well as that of sodium, precede the declaration of other vitamins and minerals on these labels because
traditionally vitamins have appeared first. The agency agrees with the comment that it is appropriate for potassium
to be listed at the bottom of the list because it is an electrolyte, and the electrolyte, chloride, is listed at the bottom.
For the same reason, the agency concludes that sodium should be listed with the other electrolytes. Accordingly,
the agency is revising &sect;101.36(b)(3)(ii) to state that sodium and potassium should be listed, in that order,
following the electrolyte chloride at the bottom of the list of minerals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. One comment requested clarification regarding the labeling to be used on a package that has two compartments,
each containing a different supplement to be taken at the same time, three times daily with meals. The company asked
if the regulations permit the information for both supplements to be reported aggregately in one nutrition label
that has one column of names and amounts and one column of percent Daily Values. The firm requested that if an aggregate
label is not permitted, the additional nutrition label be permitted in a package insert. The company also asked how
the information should be presented if children one to four years of age are to take the same amount as adults, and how
it is to be presented if such children are to take half the amount of adults. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency advises that if two supplements are to be taken at the same time, one unit of each three times daily, the nutrition
information for both supplements must be reported aggregately. In this situation, the serving size must clearly
state that a serving includes one of each supplement, with one column listing names and the total quantitative amount
by weight for both supplements and another column containing the total percent Daily Values. If this product is also
represented for use by children one to four years of age, the percent Daily Values for this age group would have to be
presented in a third column. In the case where the serving size is different for children, a nutrition label for adults
and a separate nutrition label for children must be used to avoid confusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. A few comments requested that the declaration of the percent of vitamin A present as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene be mandatory. These comments argued that this information is needed to help consumers compare the amounts
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene in various products. They stated that this information would help consumers understand claims such as
``Now with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene.'' One of these comments requested the voluntary declaration of the quantitative amount of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene in addition to the percentage of vitamin A present as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene. This comment stated that calculations of vitamin A and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene values are difficult even for scientists, and that merely providing a percentage will not allow consumers
to readily determine just how much 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene is present in the product. The comment requested that the amount of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene be expressed in mg. Two comments requested that the percent of vitamin A present as retinol also be mandatory.
One of these comments explained that most people are better off getting their vitamin A from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene rather than from retinol because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene is safer in high doses and may help reduce the risk of certain cancers, heart disease, cataracts, and other
health problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not persuaded that the declaration of the percent of vitamin A present as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene should be mandatory because quantitative recommendations about the intake of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene have not yet been established by the scientific community. In the July 19, 1990, mandatory nutrition labeling
proposal (55 FR 29476 at 29493), the agency set out the factors that it considered in deciding whether a nutrient or
food component should be mandatory or voluntary in nutrition labeling:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has proposed to make the declaration of a nutrient or food component mandatory in nutrition labeling when
quantitative intake recommendations with respect to the nutrient or component are highlighted in the reports * *
* (e.g., ``Reduce total fat intake to 30% or less of calories.''&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;  * * *), and the nutrient
or component is of particular public health significance as defined in several recent consensus documents * * *. On
the other hand, for those nutrients or food components for which quantitative intake recommendations are not highlighted
but that do have some public health significance * * *, or for which quantitative recommendations are available but
that are not of pressing public health importance (e.g., the Recommended Dietary Allowances for several vitamins
and minerals * * *), the agency is proposing to make declaration of the nutrient or component voluntary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(55 FR 29487 at 29493.) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency concludes that its decision to have the percent of vitamin A present as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene be voluntary is consistent with these guidelines because quantitative intake recommendations have not
been established. On the other hand, if a claim about 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene is made, information on the percent of vitamin A present as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene is needed to help consumers to understand the claim. Therefore, the agency is modifying &sect;101.36(b)(3)(iv)
to require declaration of the percent of vitamin A present as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene when a claim is made about 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene. The agency tentatively concludes that a parallel change in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(vi) for the labels of foods
in conventional food form is appropriate. The agency intends to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propose this change in the near future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is accepting the comment's suggestion to provide that when the percent of vitamin A present as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene is declared, the quantitative amount of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene may also be declared voluntarily. The agency is persuaded by the comment that this information on the labels
of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals would be useful to those individuals who are interested in maintaining
a certain quantitative intake of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene in their diets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that the comment requested that the amount of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene be declared in terms of mg. However, the agency is requiring that international units (IU) be used in place
of mg to be consistent with the declaration of vitamin A. FDA finds the usefulness of this added information would be
reduced if the units used to quantify vitamin A and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene levels differ. Accordingly, the agency is amending &sect;101.36(b)(3)(iv) to provide that when the percent
of vitamin A present as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene is declared, the quantitative amount in terms of IU may also be declared, e.g., ``Vitamin A 5000 IU (90 percent
(4500 IU) as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene''). The agency intends to propose a parallel change in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(vi) as soon as possible. Until
the agency does so, the agency advises that it is unlikely that it will take enforcement action against foods regulated
under &sect;101.9 that declare 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene in a manner consistent with
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;101.36(b)(3)(iv) as long as they comply with &sect;101.9 in all other respects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the provision on type size requirements for the added statement on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene in &sect;101.36(c)(6) is corrected to refer to paragraph (b)(3)(iv) instead of to (b)(3)(ii). There was
an inadvertent error in this reference in the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to retinol, the agency concludes that, in accordance with the guidelines set out above, the declaration
of retinol should be neither mandatory nor voluntary because of the absence of quantitative intake recommendations
and of public health significance. Thus, the agency is not changing the proposed rule to provide for the inclusion
of retinol in the nutrition label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. One comment requested that &sect;101.36(b)(3)(v) be revised to ``permit common synonyms,'' instead of only
the synonyms specified. This comment stated that allowing all synonyms would provide people with more information
and would ensure that the contents of products were, in fact, comprehensible to more people. The comment mentioned,
for example, that niacin is known by many as vitamin B3 and vitamin E by the name alpha-tocopherol. Another comment
expressed support for restricting the use of synonyms to the ones allowed in the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is not persuaded that the provision on synonyms should be revised to ``permit common synonyms,'' instead
of only the synonyms specified. The terminology that the agency has recognized is that which is used in NAS' RDA table
(Ref. 2). These include: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate (folacin),
and calories (energy). The agency has restricted the use of synonyms to simplify nutrition labeling and to avoid potential
confusion among consumers. The agency believes that allowing the unrestricted use of other synonyms will contribute
to confusion about the nutrients that are present in the product. It will also make product comparisons more difficult
because of the absence of consistent terminology. Therefore, FDA is not making the change requested by the comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. At least one comment requested that the nutrition label of vitamins with iron, for example, be allowed to highlight
the listing of iron. The comment stated that such highlighting is a useful and necessary tool to differentiate various
product lines. The agency is not persuaded that the highlighting of iron in the example described in the comment is
necessary for consumers to differentiate between various product lines because the name, or statement of identity,
of the product must identify the product as a multivitamin with iron. This identification is sufficient to differentiate
the product from other multivitamin products. As discussed in the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule (58 FR
2079 at 2138), FDA is not permitting highlighting of this type because it can be used inconsistently in a way that would
be potentially misleading to consumers. Among products with similar nutrition profiles, some would highlight certain
nutrients and others would not. Consumers could not depend on the fact that all labels of similar products would look
the same, and the differences in highlighting could undermine the credibility of the information on the nutrition
label and lead to consumer confusion. Accordingly, the agency is not providing for the highlighting requested by
the comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. A number of comments suggested that the source of a vitamin or mineral be included in the nutrition label immediately
following the listing of that vitamin or mineral, in a manner similar to the allowed listing of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene as a source of vitamin A. One comment stated that this information should be listed in a separate column entitled
``Source.'' One comment requested that the source information should at least be optional. The comments stated that
if this suggestion is adopted, it will be unnecessary to repeat source information in the ingredient statement, and
one comment requested that the regulations on ingredient labeling be revised accordingly. The comments said that
this approach would conserve space and more effectively communicate source information to consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that the parenthetical listing of the source of a vitamin or mineral in the nutrition label is a common
practice by some, but not all, manufacturers in the dietary supplement industry. The agency finds, however, that
the comments submitted failed to provide adequate justification and supporting information demonstrating that
adoption, on an industry-wide basis, of this manner of expressing nutrition and ingredient information would result
in a nutrition label that is readily observable and comprehensible, as required by the act. Comments have not demonstrated
that consumers will be able to distinguish and understand the meaning of both the nutrition and ingredient information
provided. FDA has no means on which to determine, for example, whether the name of the source of the nutrient is indeed
that and not the chemical name of the nutrient. The comments also failed to provide data to demonstrate that this manner
of presentation truly conserves label space, especially if additional columns are added to the nutrition label.
Further, if as suggested by one comment, source information within the nutrition label were made optional, the consistency
of presentation of information that has been a guiding principle of the agency throughout the food label reform efforts
would be violated. Accordingly, the agency is not providing for the parenthetical listing of nutrient source within
the nutrition label.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency advises, however, that it would be receptive to a adequately supported petition on this issue, and that
it will act expeditiously on such petition. Given that, elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the agency is establishing a date of applicability of July 1, 1995, for the regulation governing nutrition labeling
of dietary supplements, if a petition is promptly submitted, that petition could be acted upon before the date of applicability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any petition submitted to permit source declaration within the nutrition label would have to address, in detail,
at least the issues of how the source information is to be consistently and clearly expressed, and why this manner of
expression is advantageous to the consumer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because a primary purpose of the nutrition label is to allow consumers to compare the nutrition profile of products
at the point of purchase, it is imperative that there be a high degree of consistency in the presentation of nutrition
information for all dietary supplements. FDA would also need information on precisely how source information should
be expressed within the nutrition label. For example, how would the source information be expressed if a single ingredient
(e.g., fish liver oil) is a source of a number of nutrients (e.g., vitamins A and D) within a dietary supplement? If the
source is required to be listed multiple times, how does this conserve label space? Also, would multiple listing of
a source mislead consumers about the amount of the ingredient in the food? Conversely, if a nutrient in a supplement
is provided from several sources (e.g., iodine from kelp and potassium iodide), how would this information be clearly
and consistently conveyed? Would the source listed be all sources, or only the primary source, of the nutrient? If
source listing in the nutrition label were to be limited to the primary source, how would the primary source be determined?
Are safeguards necessary to ensure that consumers are not misled by inappropriate emphasis on certain sources of
nutrients? For example, how would consumers be fully informed and be protected from being misled if a nutrient is derived
from more than one source, and only the primary source is listed, particularly if a valued ingredient provides some,
but not all, of the nutrient in question?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should source information be permitted in the nutrition label only when there is some significance to the source?
For example, because there are potential safety concerns about high intakes of vitamin A from some other sources,
FDA found that there is was a public health reason for permitting 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene to be shown as a source of vitamin A. Should such a finding be a prerequisite for permitting source labeling?
If source labeling is limited to cases in which the source is significant (e.g., particularly valued sources, concern
about other potential sources), how should such significance be consistently determined?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, any petition on source labeling in the nutrition label should address the issue of clarity of presentation.
Section 2(b)(1)(A) of the 1990 amendments states that the nutrition information should be readily observable and
comprehensible. Would adding information about the source of nutrients detract from the comprehensibility of the
nutrition label? Given that source information will be available in the ingredient statement, would source declarations
unnecessarily burden the nutrition label and detract from its primary purpose of providing a nutrient profile of
the product? Would it be more difficult for consumers to find the listing of the quantitative amounts by weight of nutrients
in the nutrition label when source information is given? Petitions on this issue would be strengthened by the inclusion
of consumer survey or other similar data showing that consumers readily observe and comprehend information presented
in the manner suggested by the comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the mandatory labeling final rule (58 FR 2079 at 2170), dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals,
like other foods, are required to bear a complete list of ingredients. Under section 403(i)(2) of the act, the statement
of ingredients must list all ingredients of these foods, including , for example, lactose and other fillers, artificial
colors, flavors, binders, and excipients, as well as the source of the vitamins and minerals in the dietary supplement.
This section of the act provides FDA with authority to grant exemptions from the ingredient listing requirements,
but such exemptions have not been sought by the dietary supplement industry. The agency advises that the fact that
the name of an ingredient appears elsewhere on the label is not, in and of itself, sufficient justification to grant
such exemptions. Therefore, any petition on this subject must address the issue of how this manner of presentation
of the source of nutrients continues to fulfill the primary purpose of the ingredient label to adequately inform consumers
about all ingredients used to make a food, including those that might be of concern because of personal health reasons
(e.g., lactose).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency advises that its current policy, as stated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 2, 1973 (38 FR 20730) and March 16, 1979 (44 FR 16005), and in subsequent correspondence with industry (Refs.
6 and 7), is that the label for dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals must contain a list of nutrients and a separate
full statement of ingredients, except those exempted by section 403(i)(2) of the act, declared by their common or
usual name. This policy is consistent with the ingredient declaration requirements for other types of products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for all the reasons cited above, FDA has decided not to take the action requested by these comments, pending
receipt and review of petitions on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Listing of Percent Daily Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
25. The agency received a number of comments that opposed the use of the term ``Percent Daily Value'' and that stated
that they preferred to continue to use the term ``percent U.S. RDA.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency disagrees with these comments. As explained in the final rule on RDI's that published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2206 at 2207 and 2208), the agency has established two sets of label references values (i.e.,
RDI's, which were previously the U.S. RDA's, and DRV's). Because the agency believed the use of the two terms on food
labels could be confusing to consumers, it established a single term, ``Daily Value'' to refer to both the RDI's and
DRV's (58 FR 2079 at 2124). The comments did not provide any new arguments or data that were not considered in that rulemaking.
Furthermore, the agency advises that it knows of no reason why dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals should
not use the terminology prescribed for foods in general. Consistency in terminology will assist consumers in maintaining
healthy dietary practices by facilitating their use of the nutrition label to construct a healthy diet that includes
both dietary supplements and foods in conventional food form. Therefore, the agency is not making any change in the
regulations in response to these comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26. One comment requested that the agency eliminate the use of the term ``RDI'' and use the term ``DRV'' for both macronutrients
and micronutrients. The comment stated that it is confusing to have more the one term. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment appears to be requesting new terms not only for the nutrition label of dietary supplements of vitamins
and minerals but also for the nutrition label of foods in conventional food form. The terms ``RDI'' and ``DRV'' were
established in the final rule on RDI's (58 FR 2206).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the proposed rule of July 19, 1990 (55 FR 29476 at 29479), the distinction between the RDI's and DRV's
is necessary for several reasons. First, the RDI's are based on the RDA's, which are considered intake levels to be
achieved. However, while some DRV's are based on recommendations to increase or maintain intake of the particular
food component, other DRV's reflect levels that are limitations on intake. Furthermore, many of the DRV's must be
based on a specific caloric intake, and, unlike the RDI's, the DRV's are not relevant for infants and young children.
Finally, the RDI's serve as criteria for use in several regulatory functions, such as the application of the agency's
food fortification policy and the assessment of the nutritional equivalency of imitation foods. The DRV's do not
have such uses. Therefore, FDA believes that it is appropriate to treat RDI's and DRV's as two different sets of reference
values. However, the agency notes that both terms are referred to as ``Daily Values'' on the nutrition label. The agency
believes that the use of a single term on the label will limit consumer confusion. Thus, the concern articulated by
the comment is fully addressed by FDA's current regulatory scheme. Accordingly, the agency is not making the requested
change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27. One comment requested that products containing 5 to 17 mg of potassium should be allowed to state, ``Contains less
than 1 percent of the Daily Value of this nutrient.'' The comment explained that 17 mg of potassium expressed to the
nearest whole percent comes to ``0 percent Daily Value'' (3,500 mg divided by 17, which rounds to zero), yet &sect;101.9(c)(5)
only allows amounts less than 5 mg to be considered as zero. As a result, the nutrition label of such a product would state
15 mg potassium and 0 percent Daily Value. The comment expressed concern that such apparently contradictory statements
would be confusing to consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment identifies a concern applicable to dietary supplements and foods in conventional food form, namely that
consumers may find it confusing when there is a quantitative amount by weight for a nutrient, and yet the percent Daily
Value states 0 percent. This seeming conflict can occur with sodium, potassium, and total carbohydrate on labels
of both supplements and foods in conventional food form, and with some vitamins and minerals in dietary supplements,
when both quantitative amounts by weight and percent Daily Values are given. To avoid any possible confusion that
these apparently inconsistent declarations may cause, the agency is modifying &sect;101.36(b)(4)(ii) to provide
for the declaration of ``less than 1%'' in the percent of Daily Value column when the declaration of the quantitative
amount by weight is greater than zero, and the calculation of percent Daily Value yields a value that is less than 1 percent.
The agency believes that a parallel change in &sect;101.9(d)(7)(ii) for foods in conventional food form is appropriate.
The agency intends to propose this change in the near future. Additionally, the agency notes that, consistent with
&sect;101.9(d)(7)(ii), as modified in the technical amendments (58 FR 44063 at 44077, August 18, 1993), it is modifying
&sect;101.36(b)(4)(i) to specify that the percent of Daily Value shall be calculated by dividing either the amount
declared on the label for each nutrient or the actual amount of each nutrient (i.e., before rounding) by the RDI or DRV
for the specified nutrient and multiplying by 100. The agency is making this change to provide for consistency on the
food label between the percent Daily Value and the quantitative amount by weight. The agency had previously provided
only that the amount declared be used in the calculation.

28. One comment requested clarification of &sect;101.36(b)(4)(iii), which provides that when a product is represented
or purports to be for use by a group other than adults and children older than 4 years of age, the percent Daily Value for
each group must be presented in separate columns. The comment asked if the label of a product represented for use ``for
the family'' would have to include information for all of the groups for which FDA has established RDI's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that it is appropriate for the label of a product represented for use ``for the family'' to include
information for adults and children older than 4 years of age and for children younger than 4 years of age because families
often include children in this age group. Inasmuch as there generally would be safety concerns in feeding infants
supplements intended for use by adults, FDA also advises that the statement ``for the family'' should be modified
to specifically exclude infants if a firm wants to include only a single list of RDI values. The agency does not believe
that this comment requires any change in the language of the proposed rule. However, the agency advises that for clarity,
it has changed the word ``additional'' in &sect;101.36(b)(4)(iii) to ``separate.''

29. One comment requested that the first sentence in &sect;101.36(c)(1), ``The title of 
<!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;Nutrition Facts
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; shall be set in type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label and, unless impractical, shall
be set full width of the nutrition label,'' be revised to use the term ``nutrition panel'' instead of ``nutrition label.''
The comment stated that the ``nutrition label'' could be interpreted to mean the whole label, in which case the phrase
``Nutrition Facts'' would have to be the biggest print on the label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is not persuaded that this revision is needed. In proposed &sect;101.36 and in &sect;101.9, the agency
has consistently used the term ``nutrition label'' to refer to the nutrition information set off in a box presented
under the heading of ``Nutrition Facts.'' Extensive changes would be required in both regulations to make consistent
changes wherever the term ``nutrition label'' is used. Because no other comments indicated a similar concern, the
agency is not making the requested change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. One comment requested that &sect;101.36 be revised to clarify that selective reverse printing may not be used
as a form of highlighting, consistent with &sect;101.9(d)(1)(iv).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees with this comment. It unintentionally failed to address reverse printing in &sect;101.36. In the
nutrition labeling final rule, FDA decided not to permit reverse printing as a form of highlighting because it would
interfere with the ``consistent'' look of the label (56 FR 2079 at 2138). For the same reason, the agency is not permitting
reverse printing on the nutrition labels of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals. Accordingly, the agency
has revised the second sentence of &sect;101.36(c)(1) to read ``The title and all headings shall be highlighted (reverse
printing is not permitted as a form of highlighting) to distinguish them from other information.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
31. One comment stated that labels of multivitamin supplements and multivitamin/multimineral supplements that
have a total surface area available to bear labeling of 10 or less square inches should be exempt from the requirement
in &sect;101.36(c)(4) that all information within the nutrition label shall have at least one point leading (i.e.,
space between two lines of text). Other comments stated that this provision of the proposed rule is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is not persuaded that the nutrition label on small labels should be exempt from the requirement of at least
one point leading. This requirement is much less than that required for foods in conventional food form (e.g., four
point is required between nutrients in &sect;101.9(d)(1)(ii)(C) and does little more than insure that lines of text
do not touch). As discussed in the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33721), the
agency proposed at least one point leading because of concerns about legibility. To maintain a consistent and distinctive
format that is legible, some leading is necessary. Accordingly, FDA is providing for the minimal leading of one point
in the nutrition labeling of dietary supplement of vitamins and minerals and encourages manufacturers to use more
leading whenever possible. FDA is not making a similar change for dietary supplements of herbs and of other similar
nutritional substances because comments did not demonstrate space concerns with those products that would justify
such a change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the changes in this document will help reduce space requirements (e.g., type size changes). If a manufacturer
finds that it is still technologically infeasible or impracticable to fit the nutrition label on a particular package,
it may write to the Office of Food Labeling as provided in &sect;101.36(d)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
32. One comment requested that the kerning requirements be deleted, and that instead, the regulation state that ``letters
should never touch,'' consistent with the technical amendments to &sect;101.9 published on August 18, 1993 (58 FR
44063 at 44065). Another comment requested that labels that are less than 10 square inches should be exempt from the
requirement in proposed &sect;101.36(c)(5) that all information within the nutrition label shall have type that
is kerned (i.e., has proximity of placement) no tighter than -4 setting. At least one comment supported this provision
of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency agrees that the kerning requirements should be made consistent with that for the nutrition labels on packages
of foods in conventional food form. As pointed out in a similar comment with respect to the labeling of foods in conventional
food form (58 FR 44063 at 44065), a numeric kerning value (which in effect limits the proximity of one letter to another)
has meaning only for a particular type setting system. Each such system has a unique numeric scale, and, as a result,
a setting of -4 is meaningless for systems other than the one that FDA used in designing its sample labels. The agency
acknowledges its error in including a single kerning limit that would be required for all type setting systems. Accordingly,
FDA is revising &sect;101.36(c)(5), consistent with &sect;101.9(d)(1)(ii)(D), to delete the requirement for
a -4 setting and to state that letters should never touch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
33. A couple of comments supported the provision in proposed &sect;101.36(c)(6) regarding type size, but more than
ten comments strongly opposed the provision. The agency proposed to require type size no smaller than 8 point for nutrient
information within the nutrition label and to allow no smaller than 6 point type for column headings and footnotes.
In addition, the agency proposed to allow no smaller than 6 point type for all of the information within the nutrition
label of packages having a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches. The comments said
that the total surface area available for labeling for most dietary supplements is well under 40 square inches. They
stated that the proposed 6 point minimum type size is far too large for many labels to include all of the required nutrition
information and to still allow space for the ingredient statement, necessary product codes, lot number, expiration
dates, Universal Product Code (UPC) symbols, front panel copy, and other information commonly provided on dietary
supplement labels. To alleviate this space problem, a number of comments requested that FDA allow smaller type size.
One comment requested a minimum type size of 3.0 point and another 4.0 point. However, most of the comments suggested
a minimum type size of 4.5 point, which they said is consistent with the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association
(NDMA) Label Readability Guidelines used for over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments were divided about when FDA should allow smaller print size. A few comments believed that smaller type
is needed on labels having up to 40 square inches of total surface area. Other comments suggested that such type is necessary
on various-sized labels, such as those with surface areas of less than 25, 15, 12, and 10 square inches. Finally, a few
comments suggested that the regulation should state that type size should be ``as large as possible,'' or that it should
permit manufacturers to decide for themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing many dietary supplement labels, the agency is persuaded that the 6 point minimum type size proposed
for nutrition labeling information is too large for many multivitamin and multimineral supplement labels. The agency
acknowledges that these products often have many nutrients to declare in the nutrition label, are often sold in relatively
small packages/jars, and include on the label other information not required for foods in conventional food form.
Therefore, FDA is accepting the recommendation, supported by the NDMA Label Readability Guidelines, that 4.5 point
minimum type size be allowed on smaller labels. Throughout rulemaking to implement the 1990 amendments, FDA has responded
to consumer concerns that the required nutrition information be presented in a manner that will improve legibility,
particularly to help older and vision-impaired consumers who otherwise would be effectively denied access to the
nutrition information. Because type size is a major determinant of legibility, FDA does not believe type sizes less
than 4.5 points should be allowed on package labels and encourages manufacturers to use larger type size when label
space allows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency finds that this minimum type size of 4.5 points is appropriate on packages having less than 12 square inches
of surface area available to bear labeling. The agency selected less than of 12 square inches of area available to bear
labeling as a result of its review of the comments and because it promotes consistency within food labeling regulations
inasmuch as &sect;101.2(c)(3)(i) uses this package size as the standard for exempting small packages of foods from
type size requirements, and &sect;101.9(j)(13)(i) uses it to differentiate which food packages may use a telephone
number or address for consumers to use in obtaining nutrition information as the functional equivalent of a nutrition
label if no nutrient content or health claims are made on the label. The agency also finds that this decision is reasonable
considering the practical need for smaller packages containing supplements composed of many vitamins and minerals
to have smaller print, and the need for all labels to be as legible as possible. Therefore, the agency is modifying &sect;101.36(c)(6)
to allow for packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches to use 4.5
point type size. FDA is not making a similar change for dietary supplements of herbs and of other similar nutritional
substances because comments did not demonstrate the same space concerns for those products. Additionally, the agency
is correcting &sect;101.36(c)(6) to refer to paragraph (b)(3) instead of to (b)(4) and to refer to paragraph (b)(4)
instead of to (b)(4)(ii). There were inadvertent errors in these references in the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that under &sect;101.36(g), dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals may also use all provisions
allowed in &sect;101.9(j)(13) to help accommodate the nutrition label on small and intermediate-sized packages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 If, despite these provisions, there are still packages for which there is insufficient area available to print all
required information, the agency advises manufacturers to write to the Office of Food Labeling, FDA (HFS&hyph;150),
on a case-by-case basis requesting alternative means of compliance (e.g., reduced type size or leading) in accordance
with &sect;101.36(d)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34. One comment requested that all upper case lettering be allowed for multivitamin and multimineral labels that
are less than 25 square inches in total available surface area to facilitate readability. Other comments agreed with
proposed &sect;101.36(c)(3), which requires that all information within the nutrition label utilize upper and
lower case letters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the technical amendments published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 18, 1993, the agency modified &sect;101.9(j)(13)(i)(B) to allow all upper case lettering to be used on packages
of food in conventional food form that have less than 12 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling (58
FR 44063 at 44072). To be consistent, the agency has modified &sect;101.36(c)(3) to allow packages of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals that have less than 12 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling to use all upper
case lettering. To maximize legibility and to preserve the readily identifiable image of the nutrition label, FDA
is limiting this special provision to small packages (i.e., those with less than 12 square inches of surface area)
rather than the 25 square inches requested in the comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 35. A few comments suggested ways to alleviate space problems other than by using a smaller type size. One comment wanted
to be able to present the nutrition label on any package panel, to use the tabular or linear method of listing nutrients,
and to use the abbreviations specified in &sect;101.9(j)(13)(ii). Another comment requested that the entire labeling,
not just the label on the primary container, be allowed to be used to relate nutrition information. One comment requested
that all supplements with less than 40 square inches of label space be exempt from having a large heading entitled ``Nutrition
Facts,'' a box that surrounds the nutrition panel, and the lines that separate each individual nutrient and the headings.
Other comments requested that the nonfunctional slack-fill regulations be revised to allow containers to be bigger.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that &sect;101.36(g) provides, in part, that dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals are subject
to, among other provisions, the special labeling conditions set out in &sect;101.9(j)(13) for foods in small and
intermediate-sized packages. Section 101.9(j)(13)(i) defines a small package as one that has a total surface area
available to bear labeling of less than 12 square inches and allows for the use of an address or telephone number that
a consumer can use to obtain the required information (e.g., ``For nutrition information, call 1-800-123-4567'')
as the functional equivalent of a nutrition label if no nutrient content or health claims are made on the label. When
foods in small packages either voluntarily or because of nutrition claims bear nutrition labeling, &sect;101.9(j)(13)(i)(B)
also allows the use of smaller type size than that required on larger packages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 101.9(j)(13)(ii) defines an intermediate-sized package as one that has a total surface area available to
bear labeling of 40 or less square inches. This section of the regulations provides several additional special labeling
provisions to assist manufacturers in fitting the required information on both small and intermediate-sized packages.
These provisions, which can apply to dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals in small or intermediate-sized
packages, include using specified abbreviations and presenting the required nutrition information on any label
panel. Additionally, this section provides for presenting the required information in a tabular (i.e., horizontal)
display or linear (i.e., string) fashion: (1) If the product has a total surface available to bear labeling of less
than 12 square inches, or (2) if the product has a total surface area available to bear labeling of 40 or less square inches,
and the package shape or size cannot accommodate a column display on any panel. Nutrition information may be given
in a linear fashion only if the label will not accommodate a vertical or tabular display. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the comment requesting use of labeling, not just the label on the primary container, to convey nutrition
information, the agency advises that it has traditionally required that all required information (e.g., the statement
of identity, net weight statement, ingredient list, name and place of manufacture, and nutrition information) appear
on the label of packaged foods. Labeling, which includes materials not affixed to the package (such as posters, notebooks,
leaflets, and brochures available at the point of purchase), may become separated from the packaged food and are inappropriate
for the delivery of required information. Therefore, FDA concludes that it would not be appropriate to grant the request
in this comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, FDA considers outer packaging that securely encloses a primary container and that is not intended to be separated
from the primary container under conditions of retail sale to be the equivalent of the product label. Therefore, when
a bottle containing a dietary supplement in tablet, granular, or liquid form is placed within a sealed box, the required
information must be present on the outer container where it is available to the consumer at the point of purchase. While
FDA regulations do not require that the information be repeated on the primary container inside the box, the agency
encourages manufacturers to do so, so that consumers will have easy access to the information once the container is
removed from the outer box. Likewise, if supplements are sold in sealed packaging that provides a cardboard display
around the primary container, the full display seen by the consumer becomes the product label. In these situations,
the required information shall be placed on appropriate panels as directed in &sect;&sect;101.1 and 101.2, pertaining
to the principal display panel and the information panel, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It would not be consistent with section 2(b)(1)(A) of the 1990 amendments to allow packaging with less than 40 square
inches of label space to be exempt from graphic requirements such as having the title ``Nutrition Facts'' in the largest
print within the nutrition label, having the required information enclosed within a box, and using hairlines to separate
nutrients and headings. As stated above, the agency concluded in the mandatory nutrition labeling final rule (58
FR 2079 at 2136) that if the nutrition label was to be readily observable and comprehensible, it must be presented in
as consistent a manner as possible from label to label. Thus, in establishing the requirements for the nutrition label,
the agency went to great lengths to give the format a distinctive look (e.g., through the use of a prominent heading,
highlighting of key nutrient information, and enclosure of the information in a box) to facilitate consumer recognition
of the label and to encourage use of the information. Consistency of appearance begins to be lost if these graphic elements
are omitted on certain packages. Such action would make it likely that some consumers would fail to recognize the nutrition
information and to understand the significance of the information that it presented. For this reason, FDA is not providing
the flexibility requested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the agency has reviewed the format requirements in response to these comments concerned about space problems.
To help alleviate space problems, the agency has concluded that it can provide for flexibility in the placement of
the heading,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``% Daily Value.'' When a dietary supplement contains less than 5 calories per serving, ``Calories'' need not be declared.
In this situation, shown in the sample labels in &sect;101.36(c)(8) of the proposal (58 FR 33715 at 33728 through 33730),
the heading ``% Daily Value'' is placed to the right and under the bar beneath the heading ``Amount Per Serving.'' Because
there is sufficient space on one line for both headings, the agency is modifying &sect;101.36(b)(4) to provide that
the heading ``% Daily Value'' may be placed on the same line as the heading ``Amount Per Serving,'' when calorie information
is not required to be declared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, consistent with provisions in &sect;101.9(d)(11)(i) and (ii) that allow lower portions of the vertical format
to be split and moved to the contiguous right, FDA is providing in &sect;101.36(c)(10) that, if space is not adequate
to list the required information in one vertical list (as shown in the sample labels in &sect;101.36(c)(9)), the list
may be split and the lower information moved to the right as long as the headings are repeated. The list to the right should
be set off by a line that distinguishes it and sets it apart from the nutrients and the percent Daily Value information
given to the left. A sample of this split format is included in &sect;101.36(c)(10). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is not convinced by the comment that the nonfunctional slack-fill regulations should be revised to allow
containers of dietary supplements to be larger than otherwise necessary to accommodate the labeling requirements.
As discussed in the final rule on nonfunctional slack-fill (58 FR 64123 at 64134, December 6, 1993), the agency knows
of no reason for treating dietary supplements differently from foods in conventional food form. In response to this
and the other comments suggesting ways to alleviate space constraints, the agency advises that many of the changes
that FDA has made from the proposal will help to reduce space requirements (e.g., reduced type size requirements on
packages of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals). If manufacturers find that it is still technologically
infeasible or impracticable to fit the nutrition label on a particular package, they may write to the Office of Food
Labeling as directed in &sect;&sect;101.9(g)(9) and 101.36(d)(2). The agency points out that any information,
other than the net quantity of contents and statement of identity, may be printed parallel to the base of a package.
Thus, the nutrition label may be printed parallel to the base of a package, which may provide more space for this information.
However, FDA urges manufacturers to strive for consistency of presentation of nutrition information in the market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36. One comment requested that hairlines be required to separate lines of nutrient declarations, and that these hairlines
be centered between the lines of text. This comment also requested clarification that Appendix B to part 101, which
is referenced in &sect;101.36(c)(8), contains several nonrequired elements, such as Helvetica typeface, at least
13 point type for ``Nutrition Facts,'' and a specific thickness for the separating bars on the nutrition label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33716), the agency intends
that the nutrition labeling on vitamin or mineral supplements be presented in a manner that is as similar as possible
to the nutrition labeling of foods in conventional food form. Hairlines are required in the nutrition labeling of
foods in conventional food form as specified in &sect;101.9(d)(1)(v). The agency intended that &sect;101.36 contain
a similar provision. However, it inadvertently failed to specifically provide for hairlines in the proposed rule,
although it included hairlines in the samples labels presented in proposed &sect;101.36(c)(9) and urged that the
graphic specifications set forth in Appendix B to part 101 be followed. These graphic specifications describe the
use of hairlines under C-2. Accordingly, the agency concludes that it is appropriate to modify &sect;101.36(c) to
require hairlines in &sect;101.36(c)(7) and to redesignate paragraphs (c)(7) and (c)(8) as paragraphs (c)(8) and
(c)(9), respectively, to reflect this modification. New &sect;101.36(c)(7) states: ``A hairline rule that is centered
between the lines of text shall separate each nutrient and its corresponding percent Daily Value required in paragraph
(b)(4) of this section from the nutrient and percent Daily Value above and below it, as shown in paragraph (c)(9) of
this section, and shall separate 'Amount Per Serving' from the calorie statement, when the listing of calories is
required.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to Appendix B, the comment is correct in stating that Appendix B contains several nonrequired elements,
such as Helvetica typeface, a specified type size for the title ``Nutrition Facts,'' and a specific thickness for
the separating bars on the nutrition label. The required graphic elements are specified in &sect;101.36(b) and (c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
37. A couple of comments objected to the bar at the bottom of the nutrition label and requested that this requirement
be deleted. They stated that it is unnecessary and may interfere with the scanning of the UPC symbol. Another comment
requested that &sect;101.36(c) be revised to require a bar following the final vitamin or mineral listed. Other comments
supported the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In &sect;101.36(b)(3)(ii), FDA proposed to require a bar at the bottom of the nutrition label of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals to help ensure that the nutrition label on these types of foods has the same readily identifiable
image, or ``look,'' as the nutrition label on foods in conventional food form (58 FR 33715 at 33719). Comments to the
agency's proposed rule on the format for nutrition labeling (57 FR 32058, July 20, 1992) had argued that a consistent
look to the required nutrition information on food packages will help consumers find the information on the package
and to recognize it for what it is--a profile of the nutrient content of the food. These comments convinced FDA that
the specific format elements mandated provide a visually integrated image that will give the nutrition label a uniform
appearance across the various types of packages in the market and will enhance consumer use of the information. Nothing
in the comments on proposed &sect;101.36 provide the basis for a different conclusion. FDA finds that contrary to
the comments' assertion, this bar contributes directly to the consistent look of the nutrition label. To avoid any
possible interference of the bar at the bottom of the nutrition label with the scanning of the UPC symbol, manufacturers
may design the package layout so that the UPC symbol is not adjacent to the nutrition label. Accordingly, the agency
is not modifying &sect;101.36(b)(3)(ii) in response to these comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
38. One comment requested that bars be required after ``Serving Size'' and ``Amount Per Serving.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency points out that &sect;101.36(b)(3) requires that the heading ``Amount Per Serving'' be separated from
other information on the label by a bar above and beneath it. Thus, the upper bar will be beneath the declaration of ``Servings
Per Container'' or, when ``Servings Per Container'' is not required, of ``Serving Size.'' The lower bar would separate
the declaration ``Amount Per Serving'' from the heading ``Percent Daily Value.'' The agency notes that this bar should
follow information on calories, when that information is declared (i.e., when the dietary supplement of vitamins
and minerals contains 5 or more calories), to be consistent with the labeling of foods in conventional food form (&sect;101.9(d)(6)).
However, the agency inadvertently failed to specify in the proposed rule where this bar should be placed. As discussed
in the nutrition labeling proposal for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33716), the agency intended that the nutrition
labeling on vitamin and mineral supplements be presented in a manner as similar as possible to the nutrition labeling
of foods in conventional food form. Therefore, FDA finds that it is the logical outgrowth of the proposal to specify
in this final rule where the bar following ``Amount Per Serving'' should be placed when information on calories is
declared in a nutrition label for a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals. Accordingly, the agency is modifying
&sect;101.36(b)(3) to state: ``The heading 
<!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;Amount Per Serving
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; shall be separated from other information on the label by a bar above and beneath it, except when calories are
listed, the bar shall be placed beneath the calorie declaration.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
39. At least three comments requested that dietary supplements be able to indicate compliance with United States
Pharmacopeia (USP) requirements. One of these comments requested that a new paragraph, &sect;101.36(d)(3), be
added that would provide that the label could bear a box entitled ``Nutrition Facts'' that would contain nutrition
information for USP recognized substances that are the source of vitamins and minerals. Immediately below that box,
the label would bear another section entitled, ``Other Ingredients'' that would list all additional ingredients
present in more than insignificant amounts, followed by a listing of all other added substances incorporated in the
product as excipients. The comment stated that by listing all other ingredients present, consistency with section
411(b)(2)(A)(i) of the act would be achieved. Alternatively, this comment requested that the following sentence
be added after the first sentence of &sect;101.36(d)(2): ``Such allowances will also be considered where a firm produces
an article that purports to comply with the requirements of the official USP and seeks to label it in accordance with
the requirements of the Pharmacopeia.'' The comment stated that this new sentence would allow firms to comply with
USP labeling requirements with FDA's permission. Additionally, this comment requested that the name of products
that meet USP quality standards be followed by the letters ``USP.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both of the comment's suggested changes in &sect;101.36(d) would allow for two very different forms of nutrition
labeling on dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals, depending upon whether a manufacturer chose to follow
FDA's requirements, which are generally consistent with &sect;101.9, or USP's, which would list only USP recognized
nutrients in the top box. A manufacturer's decision to follow the USP approach would result in a nutrition label that
was inconsistent with labels of other dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals, with dietary supplements of
herbs and other similar nutritional substances, and with foods in conventional food form. The comment also appears
to request that the determination of whether or not a nutrient should be listed in the nutrition label should be based
upon its USP status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA finds that it would not be consistent with section 2(b)(1)(A) of the 1990 amendments to provide the flexibility
sought by these comments. As discussed in response to earlier comments, the agency decided in the mandatory nutrition
labeling final rule that if the nutrition label was to be readily observable and comprehensible, it must be presented
in as consistent a manner as possible from label to label. Thus, it was the agency's determination that, whenever possible,
nutrition labeling requirements should ensure a distinctive look and order of nutrients to facilitate consumer
recognition and understanding of the label and to encourage use of the information. Allowing two different nutrition
labeling schemes would make it likely that some consumers would fail to recognize the nutrition information or would
be too confused to be able to use it fully. FDA has made the same decision with respect to dietary supplements and thus
is not providing the flexibility requested. However, in regard to the request that the name of ingredients of USP quality
be allowed to indicate USP status, the agency advises that although statements appearing outside of the nutrition
label are beyond the scope of this final rule, it would not object to the use of truthful and nonmisleading statements
regarding USP status elsewhere on product labels. Further, FDA would not object to the use of the USP symbol in the ingredient
list to identify those ingredients that are USP grade. The agency advises that it will not consider the USP symbol,
when used in this way, to constitute intervening material in the ingredient list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 40. One comment requested that FDA recognize USP methodology. This comment stated that &sect;101.36(d)(1) requires
that dietary supplements comply with &sect;101.9(g)(2), which specifies Association of Official Analytical Chemists
(AOAC) test methodology for nutrient analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency wishes to clarify that &sect;101.9(g)(2) states that when FDA determines compliance, it will analyze
composite samples by appropriate methods as given in the ``Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International,''
15th edition, or, if no AOAC method is available or appropriate, by other reliable and appropriate analytical procedures.
Manufacturers, however, are free to use whatever methodology they believe will give results consistent with methods
used by FDA. Therefore, the requested change is unnecessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
41. One comment requested that the compliance criteria be revised to allow the actual content of any vitamin or mineral
in a dietary supplement to be 90 percent, instead of at least 100 percent, of the declared value. This comment stated
that the proposed rule (i.e., &sect;101.36(d)(1), which refers to &sect;101.9(g)(1) through (g)(2)) requires
that products that contain added vitamins and minerals provide at least the amount declared for each nutrient. The
comment stated that consideration should be given to the fact that many dietary supplements, while formulated to
contain at least 100 percent of the declared amount, are designed to retain only at least 90 percent of their declared
amount over the shelf life declared on these products. The comment attributed this practice to the fact that USP monographs
for several nutritional products require a minimum nutrient content of 90 percent of the label declaration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is not persuaded by this comment. As previously discussed in response to a similar comment in the mandatory
nutrition labeling final rule (58 FR 2079 at 2171), dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals are fabricated products.
The comments provided no convincing reason for why they should not be held to the same standards as foods in conventional
food form that are fortified or enriched. The agency has informed USP that anything less than 100 percent of the value
declared on the label for vitamin and mineral products is not acceptable to FDA, and that the only permissible deviation
from this requirement would be a deviation that is attributable to the variability of the analytical method (Ref.
8). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that, contrary to the statement in the comments, the General Notices of the USP state that a dosage
should be formulated to provide 100 percent of the labeled amount (Ref. 9). The limits in the USP monographs allow for
overages of ingredients known to decrease with time, for analytical error, for manufacturing and compounding variations,
and for deterioration to an extent considered insignificant under practical conditions (Ref. 9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42. One comment pertained to small businesses. The comment stated that ``burdening the manufacturer with the cost
of the nutrition labeling requirements (listing that a vitamin supplement contains no fat, no protein, no carbohydrate,
etc.) would be a useless exercise, especially in the case of the marketing of a single ingredient substance.'' The
comment requested that &sect;101.36(f)(1) of the proposed rule be revised to either delete the nutrition labeling
requirement for small businesses or to allow the nutrition label to declare only those nutrients actually present
in the supplement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that this comment misunderstood the proposed rule. As the comment requested, the agency requires
nutrition labeling ``only with respect to those substances actually contained in the supplement.'' Manufacturers
are not burdened with the cost of declaring that a vitamin supplement contains no fat, no protein, or no carbohydrate
if they do not. Only nutrients present in significant amounts are required to be declared under &sect;101.36(b)(3).
Therefore, the agency is not changing the regulation in response to this comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA notes that Congress recently passed, and the President signed on August 13, 1993, the Nutrition Labeling and Education
Act Amendments of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-80) that modified the treatment of small businesses. As a result of this change,
the exemption from nutrition labeling requirements for small businesses that are food manufacturers will be based
on the number of employees in a firm and the number of units of each product sold. FDA expects to publish a proposal to
amend &sect;&sect;101.9 and 101.36 to reflect the new law.

F. Misbranding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
43. One comment stated that &sect;101.9(k)(1) through (k)(6) should not apply to dietary supplements. The comment
stated that &sect;101.9(k)(1) is overbroad such that it suppresses truthful, nonmisleading speech about the beneficial
properties of a nutrient supplement product that may, by virtue of the supplement's inherent properties, not only
be a food but also aid in the prevention, cure, mitigation, or treatment of any disease. This comment did not focus on
why &sect;101.9(k)(2) through (k)(6) should not apply to dietary supplements. Other comments specifically mentioned
that the first sentence of &sect;101.9(k)(5) is vague, confusing, and contradictory. This sentence provides that
a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its label or labeling represents, suggests, or implies that the food has dietary
properties when such properties are of no significant value or need in human nutrition. These comments suggested
that this sentence be revised to read: ``A food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its label claims or represents that
the food has a significant value or need in human nutrition when the scientific evidence for the claim does not exist.''
These comments argued that this change is necessary because ``significant value or need in human nutrition'' is a
matter of consumer perception. They said that to a small child, the need for eating spinach is very low, but to the mother
the need for spinach is very high. Other comments specifically agreed that &sect;101.9(k) should apply to dietary
supplements of vitamins and minerals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency does not agree with the comment that &sect;101.9(k)(1) through (k)(6) should not apply to dietary supplements,
or that &sect;101.9(k)(1) suppresses truthful, nonmisleading speech. The comment did not provide any basis for
the agency to conclude that this provision is not applicable to dietary supplements, or that it suppresses truthful,
nonmisleading speech. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule on nutrition labeling of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2079 at 2167), the agency pointed out that the provisions
of &sect;101.9(i) (redesignated as (k)) had long been in effect at the time Congress drafted the 1990 amendments.
While Congress did enact provisions under the 1990 amendments that allow for health claims on foods, nothing in the
act or in the legislative history of the act suggest that Congress intended that &sect;101.9(i) should be changed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nor did the comments present any persuasive arguments that &sect;101.9(k)(5) of the proposed rule should be amended.
The agency does not agree that whether or not a significant value or need in human nutrition has been established is
a matter of consumer perception. The agency notes that the phrase ``significant value or need in human nutrition''
was promulgated and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 19, 1973 (38 FR 2125). In that final rule (38 FR 2125 at 2128), the agency explained that over the years there
have been a number of ingredients of products marketed as nutrients and nutritional supplements that have not been
shown to be essential in human nutrition, such as rutin, other bioflavonoids, para-aminobenzoic acid, and inositol.
The agency stated that calling attention to these ingredients in a manner that implies some nutritional benefit is
misleading. The agency concludes that the language of &sect;101.9(k)(5) remains clear and does not need clarification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agency is making no change in &sect;101.9(b) in response to these comments.

IV. Other Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA did not receive any comments that dealt specifically with the other provisions of the proposal. In the absence
of any basis for doing otherwise, FDA is adopting those provisions as proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its dietary supplement labeling proposals of June 18, 1993, FDA stated that the proposed rules on the labeling of
dietary supplements, taken as a whole, would have associated costs of approximately $20 million. Thus, the agency
concluded that the proposed rules do not constitute a major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291. In accordance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), FDA explored whether the proposed rules may have a significant
impact on small businesses and tentatively concluded that they do not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has evaluated the many comments that it received in response to its economic impact analysis. Because the issues
raised in the comments relate to all three proposals, FDA has combined its discussion of these comments and presented
them in the final rule regarding a delay in the date of application, which is published elsewhere in this issue of the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has examined the economic implications of the final rules amending 21 CFR as required by Executive Order 12866
and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available
regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits
(including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity).
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that the agency analyze options for regulatory relief for small businesses.
FDA has concluded, based on its review of the available data and comments, that these final rules are not significant
as defined by Executive Order 12866. Further, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies
that these final rules will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses.

VI. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(11) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

cooked). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

5The label statements are meant to provide guidance to manufacturers on the presentation of serving size information
on the label, but they are not required. The term ``piece'' is used as a generic description of a discrete unit. Manufacturers
should use the description of a unit that is most appropriate for the specific product (e.g., sandwich for sandwiches,
cookie for cookies, and bar for ice cream bars). The guidance provided is for the label statement of products in ready-to-serve
or almost ready-to-serve form. The guidance does not apply to the products which require further preparation for
consumption (e.g., dry mixes, concentrates) unless specifically stated in the product category, reference amount,
or label statement column that it is for these forms of the product. For products that require further preparation,
manufacturers must determine the label statement following the rules in &sect;101.9(b) using the reference amount
determined according to &sect;101.12(c).

Nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The label of a dietary supplement of a vitamin or mineral that has a Reference Daily Intake (RDI) as established
in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv) or a Daily Reference Value (DRV) as established in &sect;101.9(c)(9), shall bear nutrition
labeling in accordance with this regulation, as illustrated in paragraph (c)(9) of this section, unless an exemption
is provided for the product in paragraph (f) of this section. Dietary supplements of herbs or other similar nutritional
substances shall bear nutrition labeling in accordance with &sect;101.9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The declaration of nutrition information on the label and in labeling shall contain the following information,
using the headings and format specified, under the heading of ``Nutrition Facts''. The nutrition information shall
be enclosed in a box by use of lines, shall be all black or one color type, and shall be printed on a white or other neutral
contrasting background whenever practical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The subheading ``Serving Size'' shall be placed under the heading and aligned on the left side of the nutrition
label. The serving size shall be determined in accordance with &sect;101.9(b) and &sect;101.12(b), Table 2. Serving
size shall be expressed using a term that is appropriate for the form of the supplement, such as ``tablets,'' ``capsules,''
``packets,'' or ``teaspoonfuls.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The subheading ``Servings Per Container'' shall be placed under the subheading ``Serving Size'' and aligned
on the left side of the nutrition label, except that this information need not be provided when it is stated in the net
quantity of contents declaration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A listing of all nutrients required in &sect;101.9(c) that are present in the dietary supplement in quantitative
amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in &sect;101.9(c). Those nutrients that are not
present, or that are present in amounts that would be declared as zero, shall not be declared. In addition, potassium,
vitamin K, chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, and selenium shall be declared, except when present
in quantitative amounts by weight that allow a declaration of zero. The name of each nutrient listed shall be immediately
followed by the quantitative amount by weight of the nutrient. Nutrient names and quantitative amounts shall be presented
in a column under the heading of ``Amount Per Serving'' and aligned on the left side of the nutrition label. The heading
``Amount Per Serving'' shall be separated from other information on the label by a bar above and beneath it, except
that when calories are listed, the bar shall be placed beneath the calorie declaration. When the serving size of the
product is one unit (e.g., one tablet), a heading consistent with the declaration of the serving size, such as ``Amount
Per Tablet'' or ``Each Tablet Contains,'' may be used in place of the heading ``Amount Per Serving.'' Other appropriate
terms, such as capsule, packet, or teaspoonful, may be used in place of the term ``Serving.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) These amounts shall be expressed in the increments specified in &sect;101.9(c), except that the amounts of vitamins
and minerals, excluding sodium and potassium, declared on the nutrition label shall be the actual amount of the vitamin
or mineral included in the dietary supplement, using the units of measure and the levels of significance given in &sect;101.9(c).
In declaring the amounts of vitamins and minerals, zeros following decimal points may be dropped, and additional
levels of significance may be used when the number of decimal places indicated is not sufficient to express lower amounts
(e.g., the RDI for copper is given in whole milligrams (mg), but the quantitative amount may be declared in tenths of
a mg). Amounts for chloride, fluoride, and manganese shall be expressed in mg, and, amounts for chromium, molybdenum,
selenium, and vitamin K shall be expressed in micrograms. These values shall be expressed in whole numbers, except
that tenths may be used for fluoride. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Nutrients that are present shall be listed in the order specified in &sect;101.9(c); except that, when present,
vitamin K shall follow vitamin E; calcium and iron shall follow pantothenic acid; selenium shall follow zinc; and
manganese, fluoride, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, and potassium shall follow copper. This results
in the following order for vitamins and minerals: Vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, thiamin, riboflavin,
niacin, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, biotin, pantothenic acid, calcium, iron, phosphorus, iodine, magnesium,
zinc, selenium, copper, manganese, fluoride, chromium, molybdenum, chloride, sodium, and potassium. A bar shall
separate the last nutrient to be listed from the bottom of the nutrition label, as shown in the sample labels in paragraph
(c)(9) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the product contains two or more separately packaged dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals (e.g.,
the product has a packet of supplements to be taken in the morning and a different packet to be taken in the afternoon),
the quantitative amounts may be presented as specified in this paragraph in individual nutrition labels or in one
aggregate nutrition label with separate columns declaring the quantitative amounts for each package as illustrated
in paragraph (c)(9)(iii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The percent of vitamin A that is present as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene may be declared, to the nearest whole percent, immediately adjacent to or beneath the nutrient name (e.g.,
``Vitamin A 5000 IU (90 percent as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene)''), except that the declaration is required when a claim is made about 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene. The amount of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene in terms of international units (IU) may be included in parentheses following the percent statement (e.g.,
``Vitamin A 5000 IU (90 percent (4500 IU) as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene)'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The following synonyms may be added in parenthesis immediately following the name of these nutrients: Vitamin
C (ascorbic acid), thiamin (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate (folacin), and calories (energy). Energy
content per serving may be expressed in kilojoules units, added in parentheses immediately following the statement
of caloric content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) All nutrients shall be displayed with uniform type size, style, color, and prominence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A listing of the percent of the Daily Value (i.e., the percent of the RDI as established in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv)
or DRV as established in &sect;101.9(c)(9)), where appropriate, of all nutrients listed in the nutrition label,
except that the percent for protein may be omitted as provided in &sect;101.9(c)(7) and no percent shall be given for
sugars, vitamin K, chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, selenium. This information shall be presented
in one column aligned under the heading of
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``% Daily Value'' and to the right of the column of nutrient names and amounts. The headings ``% Daily Value (DV),''
``% DV,'' ``Percent Daily Value,'' or ``Percent DV'' may be substituted for ``% Daily Value.'' The heading ``% Daily
Value'' shall be placed on the same line as the heading ``Amount Per Serving'' or placed beneath this heading and the
bar underneath it, except that ``% Daily Value'' shall be placed beneath this bar when calorie information is required
to be declared. Calorie information shall be placed beneath ``Amount Per Serving'' and above the bar. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The percent of Daily Value shall be calculated by dividing either the amount declared on the label for each nutrient
or the actual amount of each nutrient (i.e., before rounding) by the RDI or DRV for the specified nutrient and multiplying
by 100, except that the percent for protein shall be calculated as specified in &sect;101.9(c)(7)(ii). The numerical
value shall be followed by the symbol for percent (i.e., %).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The percentages based on RDI's and on DRV's shall be expressed to the nearest whole percent, except that ``Less
than 1%'' may be used in place of ``0%'' when the declaration of the quantitative amount by weight is a value greater
than zero.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The percent of Daily Value for vitamins and minerals shall be based on RDI values for adults and children 4 or more
years of age unless the product is represented or purported to be for use by infants, children less than 4 years of age,
pregnant women, or lactating women, in which case the column heading shall clearly state the intended group. If the
product is for persons within more than one group, the percent of daily value for each group shall be presented in separate
columns as shown in paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If the product contains two or more separately packaged dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals (e.g.,
the product has a packet of supplements to be taken in the morning and a different packet to be taken in the afternoon),
the percent of Daily Value may be presented as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section in individual nutrition
labels or in one aggregate nutrition label with separate columns declaring the percent of Daily Value for each package
as illustrated in paragraph (c)(9)(iii) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) If the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein,
the value shall be followed by an asterisk that refers to another asterisk at the bottom of the nutrition label that
states ``Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) When no percent is given for sugars, vitamin K, chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, or selenium,
an asterisk shall be placed in the ``% Daily Value'' column that shall refer to another asterisk that is placed at the
bottom of the nutrition label that is followed by the statement ``Daily Value not established.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Nutrition information specified in this section shall be presented as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The title of ``Nutrition Facts'' shall be set in a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label
and, unless impractical, shall be set full width of the nutrition label. The title and all headings shall be highlighted
(reverse printing is not permitted as a form of highlighting) to distinguish them from other information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All information within the nutrition label shall utilize a single easy-to-read type style.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) All information within the nutrition label shall utilize upper and lower case letters, except that all uppercase
lettering may be utilized for packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling of less than 12 square
inches.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All information within the nutrition label shall have at least one point leading (i.e., space between two lines
of text).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Letters should never touch.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) All information within the nutrition label on packages that have a total surface area available to bear labeling
of less than 12 square inches shall have type size no smaller than 4.5 point; packages that have from 12 to 40 square inches
of surface area available to bear labeling shall have type size no smaller than 6 point; and packages with more than
40 square inches of surface area available to bear labeling shall have type size no smaller than 8 point, except that
on packages with more than 40 square inches of available surface area, type size no smaller than 6 point may be used for
the listing of information on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene, as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section, for the headings required by paragraphs (b)(3)
and (b)(4) of this section (i.e., ``Amount Per Serving'' and ``% Daily Value''), and for the footnote required by paragraph
(b)(4)(v) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) A hairline rule that is centered between the lines of text shall separate each nutrient and its corresponding percent
Daily Value required in paragraph (b)(4) of this section from the nutrient and percent Daily Value above and beneath
it, as shown in paragraph (c)(9) of this section, and shall separate ``Amount Per Serving'' from the calorie statement,
when the listing of calories is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) In the interest of uniformity of presentation, FDA urges that the information be presented using the graphic specifications
set forth in Appendix B to Part 101, as applicable.

(d)(1) Compliance with this section shall be determined in accordance with &sect;101.9(g)(1) through (g)(8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When it is not technologically feasible, or some other circumstance makes it impracticable, for firms to comply
with the requirements of this section, FDA may permit alternative means of compliance or additional exemptions to
deal with the situation in accordance with &sect;101.9(g)(9). Firms in need of such special allowances shall make
their request in writing to the Office of Food Labeling (HFS-150), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington,
DC 20204.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the location of nutrition information on a label shall be in
compliance with &sect;101.2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f)(1) Dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals are exempt from this section when they are offered for sale by a
manufacturer, packer, or distributor who has annual gross sales made or business done in sales to consumers that is
not more than $500,000 or has annual gross sales made or business done in sales of food to consumers of not more than $50,000,
Provided, That the food bears no nutrition claims or other nutrition information on a label or labeling or in advertising.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For purposes of the paragraph, calculation of the amount of sales shall be based on the most recent 2-year average
of business activity. Where firms have been in business less than 2 years, reasonable estimates must indicate that
annual sales will not exceed the amounts specified. For foreign firms that ship foods into the United States, the business
activities to be included shall be the total amount of food sales, as well as other sales to consumers, by the firm in
the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Dietary supplements of vitamins and mineral shall be subject to the special labeling conditions specified in
&sect;101.9(j)(5)(i) and (j)(5)(ii) for food, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically

I. Regulatory History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 8, 1990, President Bush signed into law the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments)
(Pub. L. 101&hyph;535). The 1990 amendments revised the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) in a number
of important ways. One of the most notable aspects of the 1990 amendments is that they establish FDA's authority to
regulate nutrient content claims on food labels and in food labeling. Section 403(r)(1)(A) of the act, which was added
by the 1990 amendments, provides that a product is misbranded if it bears a claim in its label or labeling that either
expressly or implicitly characterizes the level of any nutrient of the type required to be declared as part of nutrition
labeling, unless such claim has been specifically defined (or otherwise exempted) by regulation. The 1990 amendments
also direct the Secretary and, by delegation, FDA to promulgate regulations to define specific nutrient content
claims including ``free,'' ``low,'' ``light'' or ``lite,'' ``reduced,'' ``less,'' and ``high'' (section 3(b)(1)(A)(iii)
of the 1990 amendments).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60421 and 56 FR 60478), FDA published two documents in which it proposed, among other things,
to define nutrient content claims, to provide for their use on foods labels, and to establish procedures for the submission
and review of petitions regarding the use of specific nutrient content claims. These proposals applied to dietary
supplements as well as foods in conventional food form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 6, 1992, the President signed the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992, Title II of Pub. L. 102&hyph;571 (the DS
act). Section 202(a)(1) of the DS act established a moratorium on the implementation of the 1990 amendments with respect
to dietary supplements until December 15, 1993. Section 202(a)(2)(A) required the Secretary, and by delegation
FDA, to issue proposed regulations on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements no later than June 15, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA issued final regulations that implemented the 1990 amendments with respect to nutrient content claims on foods
in conventional food form on January 6, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as the ``final rule on nutrient content claims'')
(58 FR 2302). FDA modified these final regulations slightly in a document that made technical corrections to them
(58 FR 44020, August 18, 1993) (hereinafter referred to as ``the technical corrections document''). In response
to the requirements of the DS act, FDA published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33731) a proposal to: (1) Include dietary supplements under the coverage of the general principles
for nutrient content claims; (2) provide for the use of expressed and implied nutrient content claims on labels or
in labeling of dietary supplements; and (3) provide for petitions for nutrient content claims for dietary supplements
(hereinafter referred to as the ``proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received approximately 500 letters in response to its June 18, 1993, proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary
supplements. Each letter contained one or more comments. The letters were from a wide range of sources, including
consumers; consumer organizations; professional associations; Federal, State, and local government agencies;
industry; and industry trade associations. Many comments generally supported the proposal or various provisions
of the proposal. Other comments addressed issues outside the scope of the proposal (e.g., freedom of choice, access
to health care, access to dietary supplements) and will not be discussed here. Many comments suggested modifications,
revisions, or revocations of various aspects of the proposal. A summary of the comments, the agency's responses to
the comments, and a complete discussion of the agency's conclusions with respect to nutrient content claims for dietary
supplements follows.

II. Nutrient Content Claims for Dietary Supplements_FDA Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. A couple of comments contended that FDA lacks the statutory authority to prohibit claims for substances for which
no reference value (i.e., Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or Daily Reference Value (DRV)) has been established. The
comments also stated that the agency lacks legal authority to promulgate regulations governing products bearing
a nutrient content claim for a nutrient or other substance not explicitly named in section 403(q)(1) or (q)(2) of the
1990 amendments. The comments said that the references to section 403(q)(1) or (q)(2) of the act are references to
those nutrients that the 1990 amendments require to be listed (``mandatory nutrients'') on the nutrition label.
The comments argued that under these provisions, a food may be subject to a misbranding charge under section 403(r)(1)
of the act only if it characterizes, either explicitly or implicitly, the level of a mandatory nutrient in the food.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments also stated that the 1990 amendments did not provide FDA with misbranding authority over products that
bear a claim characterizing the level of a nutrient or other substance that is not listed in section 403(q)(1) or (q)(2)
of the act. The comments maintained that, regardless of whether a RDI or DRV has been established, no special requirements
should apply if a manufacturer of a substance not covered by section 403(q)(1) or (q)(2), such as garlic, wished to
claim that his product was ``high in garlic'' or a ``good source of garlic.'' The comments argued that while FDA maintains
its general misbranding authority over products bearing claims that characterize the level of a nonmandatory substance,
FDA still must meet its burden of proving that any such claims are actually ``false or misleading in any particular''
under the general misbranding provision, section 403(a)(1) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 403(r)(1)(A) of the act states that a food intended for human consumption is misbranded if it bears a claim
that expressly or by implication ``characterizes the level of any nutrient which is of the type required by paragraph
(q)(1) or (q)(2) to be in the label or labeling of the food * * *.'' The statute uses the same language in section 403(r)(1)(B)
to describe the substances that could be the subject of a health claim. A health claim is a claim that ``characterizes
the relationship of any nutrient which is of the type required by paragraph (q)(1) or (q)(2) to be in the label or labeling
of the food to a disease or a health-related condition&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;  * * *.'' Under section
403(r)(1)(B), a health claim may be made in accordance with section 403(r)(5)(D) as well as section 403(r)(3). Thus,
because a statute must be read as a whole, the language in section 403(r)(1)(A) and (r)(1)(B) of the act that describes
the substances that may be the subject of a nutrient content or of a health claim must be read in conjunction with section
403(r)(5)(D), which addresses health claims for vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances
that are components of dietary supplements. Thus, the ``nutrients of the type required by paragraph (q)(1) or (q)(2)''
that are the subject of sections 403(r)(1)(A) and (r)(1)(B) of the act include vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other
similar nutritional substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislative history of ``other nutritional substances'' reveals that its coverage is broad and could, in appropriate
circumstances, include garlic. See 136 Cong. Record S16609 (daily ed. October 24, 1990) (discussion between Senators
Metzenbaum and Symms). Therefore, while a label claim that a food contains garlic that is intended to describe the
taste of the food would not be subject to section 403(r)(1)(A) of the act, a claim that describes the garlic content
in a way that reveals that garlic is being referred to as a nutritional substance would be subject to that section. Under
section 403(r)(1)(A) of the act, the latter claim would misbrand the food unless its use has been authorized by FDA
under section 403(r)(2). Thus, FDA rejects the comments that disagreed with the proposed coverage of the nutrient
content claim provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has relied on the RDI's and DRV's in defining nutrient content claims under section 403(r)(2) of the act because
it has concluded that if the characterization of the level of a nutrient is to have any meaning, there must be a level
that can be used as a reference in determining whether the characterization is valid and appropriate. The RDI's and
DRV's provide such levels. Thus, in &sect;101.54(a) (21 CFR 101.54(a)), FDA has limited the use of ``good source,''
``high,'' and ``more'' claims to use with nutrients for which an RDI or DRV has been established. FDA is not aware of
any other alternative standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If interested persons are aware of other standards that can be used as reference values to establish the validity of
content claims for substances for which RDI's and DRV's have not been established, those persons should make FDA aware
of those standards through &sect;101.69 (21 CFR 101.69) or other appropriate means. FDA will carefully consider
using such standards as the basis for content claims for the substances involved.

III. Basis for Nutrient Content Claims For Dietary Supplements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Relationship to January 6, 1993 Final Rules, Consistency with Established Nutrient Content Claims, Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Many comments supported consistency in definitions for nutrient content claims between foods in conventional
food form and dietary supplements. However, one comment stated that consistency in definitions for nutrient content
claims for dietary supplements and foods in conventional food form is inappropriate. The comment argued that FDA
has chosen to define nutrient content claims that are not meaningful to the supplement industry and to consumers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many comments pointed out that dietary supplements are intended to contribute, with foods in conventional food form,
to consumers' daily nutrient intake. Thus, the comments argued that it is important that the terms used to describe
the levels of nutrients in both dietary supplements and foods in conventional food form be consistent. These comments
maintained that consumers would be confused if claims were to be allowed on dietary supplements that were not defined
in the same manner as those for foods in conventional food form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comments that said that consistency with established nutrient content claims is inappropriate
as a basic principle for defining nutrient content claims for dietary supplements. There is much about dietary supplements
that suggests that the principles that guide FDA in defining nutrient content claims for dietary supplements should
be the same as the principles that guide the agency in defining nutrient content claims on foods in conventional food
form. Dietary supplements that are not intended for use as drugs have traditionally been regulated as foods and, as
such, must be evaluated within the context of the total daily diet. In addition, nutrients from dietary supplements
serve the same physiological function as nutrients from foods in conventional food form. While some consumers seek
to ensure that the nutrient content of their diet is adequate through foods in conventional food form, other consumers
seek to ensure nutritional adequacy by making dietary supplements part of their diets (Ref. 1). Consistent use of
terms on dietary supplements and on foods in conventional food form will thus help consumers to construct a nutritionally
adequate total daily diet by allowing consumers to make meaningful comparisons among these products. It will also
facilitate use of these terms by consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the years, FDA has stressed the importance of consistent definitions and descriptive terms as a necessary requirement
for effective education and for preventing misleading labeling (Ref. 2). If terms were given different definitions
depending on whether they were to be used to describe foods in conventional food form or dietary supplements, it would
make it much more difficult for the public to understand what these terms are intended to convey about a particular
food. Moreover, a single definition for a particular term eliminates any possibility that ambiguities could be created
by the use of that term. Therefore, the agency concludes that for nutrient content claims, the definition of a particular
term should be the same regardless of the type of food that it is being used to describe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, FDA has been criticized for treating dietary supplements differently than other foods. FDA has no
desire to discriminate in any way against supplements. Thus, by having a single definition for a particular nutrient
content claim, FDA is providing the basis for dietary supplements to make the same claims as other foods and to be factored
into the diet like other foods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, as discussed in the proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements (58 FR 33731), FDA recognizes
that dietary supplements differ in at least two respects from foods in conventional food form. First, dietary supplements
are likely to contain much higher levels of nutrients than foods in conventional food form. Thus, additional nutrient
content claims that are specific for dietary supplements may be appropriate. As discussed later in this document,
the agency intends in the near future to initiate a separate rulemaking to establish such claims for dietary supplements.
Second, dietary supplements generally do not contain several nutrients (e.g., fat, cholesterol) found in foods
in conventional food form. Therefore, in this document, FDA is limiting the use of certain claims that are useful for
describing foods in conventional food form but that do not meaningfully describe dietary supplements.

B. General Principles
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Substitute Foods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. One comment objected to the requirement to use the word ``imitation'' on dietary supplements that are nutritionally
inferior to other products of the same type. The comment argued that FDA was never given the authority to decide on formulations
of dietary supplements, and that setting such formulations is the exclusive role of the manufacturer. Further, the
comment stated that there is nothing ``imitation'' about ``less'' in the supplement industry, and that a requirement
that a supplement be labeled ``imitation'' if it is nutritionally inferior to another product forces manufacturers
to increase potencies in order that their products will not have to be labeled ``imitation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 403(r)(2)(A)(ii) of the act, for a food to be labeled as ``[nutrient] free,'' the nutrient must usually
be present in the food or in a food for which it substitutes, as that term is defined by the Secretary (and by delegation,
FDA) for the food. Accordingly, the agency defined ``substitute foods'' in &sect;101.13(d) (21 CFR 101.3(d)) in
the final rule on nutrient content claims (58 FR 2302 at 2411) for the purpose of identifying the characteristics that
substitute foods must have if they are to bear nutrient content claims that highlight differences between them and
the foods for which they substitute. The definition states that a substitute food is one that may be used interchangeably
with another food that it resembles, i.e., to which it is organoleptically, physically, and functionally (including
shelf life) similar and to which it is not nutritionally inferior, unless it is labeled as an ``imitation.'' Additionally,
&sect;101.3(e)(1) (21 CFR 101.3(e)(l)) states that a food shall be deemed to be an imitation, and thus subject to the
requirements of section 403(c) of the act, if it is a substitute for or resembles another food but is nutritionally
inferior to that food. Thus, the issue that the agency must consider is whether dietary supplements that are foods
should be subject to these provisions on substitute foods as any other foods are. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has no evidence that manufacturers will increase the potencies for their products to avoid the use of this
term and disagrees that this provision will interfere with a manufacturer's right to decide on product formulations.
It is extremely unlikely that the term ``imitation'' will ever be used on dietary supplements, particularly dietary
supplements of vitamins and minerals. The issue of whether a supplement would be an ``imitation'' would arise only
when a manufacturer chooses to make a ``free'' or ``low'' claim for sugar or sodium on a dietary supplement (see comment
4). In such circumstances, under section 403(r)(2)(A)(ii) of the act, the manufacturer must identify a product on
the market with which its product can be used interchangeably, to which the manufacturers product is not nutritionally
inferior, and that contains sodium or sugar. Such a product may include the version of the manufacturer's product
that contains sodium or sugar. As long as such a product exists, the manufacturer's product need not be labeled as an
imitation. Moreover, if because of the way the manufacturer has formulated its product, there is no product with which
it is used interchangeably, the product can be called ``______, a sodium-free food.'' Only in the rare situations
in which neither of the conditions apply would the product have to be called ``imitation'' for it to bear a ``free''
or ``low'' sodium or sugar claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 101.13(d)(1) and (d)(2) are designed to ensure that material differences between the substitute food and
the reference food are conspicuously stated on the label or labeling of the food, so that consumers can make fully informed
judgments about the value of the substitute food and its usefulness in maintaining healthy dietary practices. If
a product has substantially less of a nutrient than the reference food, and to that extent is materially different
and inferior in nutrient content, then ``imitation'' is an entirely appropriate term. For this reason, the agency
concludes that there is no reason to apply the substitute food provisions any differently to dietary supplements
than to other foods.

2. Requirements for ``Low'' and ``Free'' Claims
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Several comments from dietary supplement manufacturers and trade associations questioned the need to allow ``low''
and ``free'' claims for nutrients such as fat and cholesterol that are not typically found in dietary supplements.
One comment suggested that ``free,'' ``low,'' and ``reduced'' claims for calories, fat, and cholesterol on dietary
supplements should be permitted only on dietary supplements that are a significant source of calories, such as protein
supplements. The comment argued that consumers do not expect most dietary supplements to contain significant amounts
of calories, and that it is nonsensical and confusing to permit dietary supplements that are not a significant source
of calories to make a claim about reduced amounts of calories, fat, and cholesterol contained therein. Another comment
stated that Americans who consume dietary supplements do not do so because the products are ``low in fat,'' ``cholesterol
free,'' or ``low calorie,'' and that consumers are not interested in the fat content of dietary supplements. The comment
argued that consumers care about the substances in the products and the benefits that those products can have for their
health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements, the agency requested comment on the need for extending
``free,'' ``low,'' and ``reduced'' claims to dietary supplements (58 FR 33731 at 33745). The agency has reviewed
the comments that it received and is persuaded by them that it not meaningful to allow claims about the calorie, fat
(including saturated fat), or cholesterol content of most dietary supplements. Most of these products do not contain
those nutrients, and most consumers do not expect that they do. Thus, consumers would not generally look to these products
in making dietary choices that are designed to control the amount of calories, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol
in the foods they eat. In fact, claims about these nutrients in most dietary supplements would only serve to confuse
consumers. While it is true that FDA is requiring information about these nutrients in the nutrition label of supplements
of herbs and of other similar nutritional substances, this requirement derives mainly from the limitation on the
exemption in section 403(q)(5)(F) of the act (formerly section 403(q)(5)(E)). See the final rule on general requirements
for nutrition labeling for dietary supplements published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the agency recognizes that there are some dietary supplements, such as protein supplements, in which the
amount of calories in the product is significant to consumers. On these products, the source of the calories, particularly
whether they are from fat, is relevant and useful information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA has decided, based on the comments that it received to only allow calorie, fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol
claims on those dietary supplements in which the amount of calories is important to consumers. In attempting to define
what this level of calories should be, the agency looked first to &sect;101.9(f)(1) and (j)(4), which said that a food
has ``insignificant'' calories for the purposes of nutrition labeling if it has an amount of calories that can be rounded
to zero. Section 101.9(c)(1) states that ``less than 5 calories'' per serving may be expressed as zero, the same amount
that is defined as ``calorie free.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While FDA does not have information on the caloric content of dietary supplements, it would not be unreasonable to
expect that many dietary supplements contain more than 5 calories (cal) per serving, particularly children's chewable
vitamin and mineral supplements, supplements that contain herbal extracts, and supplements that contain caloric
binders and fillers. Thus, to tie the use of ``free,'' ``low,'' and ``reduced'' calorie, fat, and cholesterol claims
on labels of dietary supplements to the presence of more than an ``insignificant amount'' of calories in the food would
be over-inclusive and would allow many products in which the amount of calories is not significant to consumers to
bear such claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA next looked at the definition of ``low calorie'' in &sect;101.60(b)(2) (21 CFR 101.60(b)(2)) for use in determining
which dietary supplements should be allowed to bear ``free,'' ``low,'' and ``reduced'' claims. Section 101.60(b)(2)
defines a ``low calorie'' food as a food that contains 40 cal or less per reference amount customarily consumed (hereinafter
referred to as reference amount) and per 50 grams (g) if the reference amount is small. FDA believes that 40 cal per reference
amount represents a reasonable level for demarcating a dietetically relevant source of calories for dietary supplements.
In a product that contains this amount of calories, the source of the calories (e.g., fat) is of significance to consumers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the agency is revising &sect;101.62(a) (21 CFR 101.62(a)) by adding paragraph (a)(4) to state that
``free,'' ``low,'' and ``reduced'' claims for fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol may not be made for dietary supplements
that meet the criteria in &sect;101.60(b)(1) and (b)(2) for ``calorie free'' and ``low calorie'' claims. FDA is also
revising &sect;101.13(b) by adding new paragraph (b)(5) to reflect these provisions. As a consequence, claims that
identify all products of that class of being ``low'' or ``free'' of a nutrient (e.g., ``vitamin C supplement, a fat-free
supplement'') will also be prohibited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, to use the same criteria (i.e., that a product may not be ``calorie free'' or ``low calorie'') as a basis for
when a calorie claim may be made, has the effect of prohibiting the very claims that the criterion seeks to permit, namely
``calorie free'' and ``low calorie'' claims. Such a criterion would permit only relative calorie claims (e.g. ``reduced'')
on dietary supplements. Therefore, a slightly different scheme for permitting calorie claims on certain dietary
supplements, such as protein supplements, must be derived.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While, as stated above, the agency believes that calorie claims should not be permitted on most dietary supplements,
it does believe that ``calorie free'' and ``low calorie'' claims may be appropriate if an equivalent amount of a similar
food (i.e., another protein supplement) that the labeled food resembles and for which it substitutes would normally
contain an appreciable amount of calories. Such a claim would highlight that the labeled food had a different calorie
profile than would be expected in the similar product. It would also serve to direct a consumer to a product that had
a lower amount of calories. Because the food would meet the criteria for ``low calorie'' and would be so labeled, it
would not be necessary to highlight any comparative differences between the labeled and the similar food as would
be required for a relative claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agency is revising &sect;101.62(a) by adding new paragraph (a)(4) to state that claims for calories
may not be made on labels of dietary supplements that meet the criteria in &sect;101.60(b)(1) or (b)(2) for ``calorie
free'' and ``low calorie'' except when an equivalent amount of a similar dietary supplement (e.g., another protein
supplement) that the labeled food resembles and for which it substitutes normally exceeds the definition for ``low
calorie'' in &sect;101.60(b)(2). It is including similar language in &sect;101.13(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments specifically objected to claims for calories, fat, and cholesterol. Claims for sodium and sugar content
were not mentioned. Since the sugar and sodium levels in dietary supplements can vary substantially, the agency finds
that claims about the sugar and sodium content of dietary supplements may be useful in helping consumers to make purchasing
decisions that will assist them in maintaining healthy dietary practices. Thus, extending the definitions of ``low,''
``free,'' and ``reduced'' for sugar and sodium to dietary supplements is appropriate irrespective of the calorie
level of the dietary supplement. Therefore, FDA concludes that there is no need to place limitations on claims for
sugar and sodium content other than those in &sect;&sect; 101.60(c) and 101.61, respectively. As explained below,
FDA is amending these provisions to reflect their application to dietary supplements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. In discussing type size for nutrient content claims, one comment stated that every new statement that is required
on dietary supplement labels will create a problem for manufacturers, particularly if they are constrained by minimum-type
size requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency acknowledges that dietary supplements are frequently packaged in small containers, and for this reason,
FDA specifically asked for information on the impact of the type size proposal on dietary supplements that are packaged
in small containers (58 FR 33731 at 33734). No suggestions or examples were presented to assist the agency in deciding
how to address this problem. Therefore, the agency has made no special provision for dietary supplements in the type
size requirements for nutrient content claims. FDA discusses the type size requirements for the nutrition labeling
of dietary supplements in the final rule on nutrition labeling of dietary supplements published elsewhere in this
issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA stated in the technical corrections document (58 FR 44020 at 44020 and 44021) that there was a need to specify the
minimum type size for labeling information (e.g., accompanying information) required under the nutrient content
claims regulation. As a result, the agency modified &sect;101.2(b) to include &sect;&sect;101.13, 101.54, 101.56,
101.60, 101.61, 101.62, and 101.65 in the list of sections set out in &sect;101.2(b) for which a minimum type size for
required label information is specified. For consistency, the agency also modified &sect;101.2(f) to include &sect;&sect;101.13,
101.54, 101.56, 101.60, 101.61, 101.62, and 101.65.The effect of these revisions for dietary supplements is that
label information required by the nutrient content claims regulations, but whose type size is not otherwise specified,
will be required to be in letters or numbers no less than one-sixteenth of an inch in height unless otherwise specified
by &sect;101.2(c). FDA believes that making nutrient content claims on dietary supplements subject to this requirement
is appropriate because this requirement is the logical outgrowth of the proposal. In the proposal on nutrient content
claims for dietary supplements, FDA raised the issue of how to make nutrient content claims on dietary supplements.
The question of how to ensure the legibility of the referral statement, which is required by section 403(r)(2)(B)
of the act, is one that is at least implicitly raised by this issue. Thus, the agency's decision to explicitly address
the question of the type size of the referral statement in this final rule represents the logical outgrowth of issues
that were raised in the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency pointed out in the technical corrections document that if there are circumstances in which the product
is not able to comply with type size requirements, manufacturers may request an alternative means of compliance (e.g.,
permission to use a reduced type size) in accordance with &sect; 101.9(g)(9). Section 101.9(g)(9) states that when
it is not technologically feasible, or some other circumstance makes it impracticable, for firms to comply with nutrition
labeling requirements, they may write to the Office of Food Labeling, Food and Drug Administration, and request an
alternative means of compliance. For the reasons explained above, dietary supplements of herbs and other similar
nutritional substances are appropriately subject to this provision even though it was not specifically set out in
the proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements. A similar provision is included in &sect;101.36(d)(2)
of the final regulation for nutrition labeling for dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals, in a companion document
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. These provisions allow flexibility to ensure that there will be either sufficient space to make nutrient content
claims on the labels of dietary supplements, or that manufacturers will have recourse to request relief.

b. Disclosure levels
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. One comment stated that there are a certain number of products, such as chewable tablets containing sodium ascorbate,
for which information on sodium might be useful to consumers in maintaining healthy diets. The comment suggested
that the agency urge supplement manufacturers to include information on sodium content, even though the sodium level
might not reach the threshold levels established in &sect;101.13(h)(1) that would trigger a required statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency disagrees that there is a sufficient basis for requiring either the declaration of total sodium content
on the principal display panel of a dietary supplement or for requiring a referral statement directing the consumer
to the nutrition label for information about sodium content on all dietary supplements. Section 101.13(h)(1) specifies
that the referral statement (i.e., ``See [appropriate panel] for information about [nutrient requiring disclosure]
and other nutrients'') is required only when the sodium (or fat, saturated fat, or cholesterol) content of a product
exceeds the disclosure level. FDA finds that there is no reason to provide a different rule for dietary supplements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To the extent, as the comment suggests, that information on sodium content would be useful, it will be provided on the
nutrition label as long as it is present at more than an insignificant level. Section 101.36(b)(3), which lists the
nutrients that must be included in the nutrition label of a dietary supplement of a vitamin or mineral, provides that
all nutrients listed in &sect;101.9(c), including sodium, must be declared on the nutrition label of a dietary supplement
of vitamins and minerals, except that nutrients present at levels that would be declared as zero shall not be declared.
(For sodium, the amount that is declared as zero is less than 5 milligrams (mg) per serving.) Section 101.9(c) itself
requires that sodium be listed on the nutrition label of other dietary supplements. Consumers thus will be able to
readily find the amount of sodium in a product by examining the nutrition label. Because the comment provided no basis
for its suggestion other than usefulness, FDA is not making any special provision for the declaration of sodium on
dietary supplements.

4. Relative Claims, Reference Foods, ``Modified''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. One comment requested that the agency clarify in &sect;101.13(j) that for dietary supplements, the reference
food may be a source of the nutrient in either a dissimilar food within a product category or a similar food. The comment
stated that the most helpful information to a consumer purchasing a dietary supplement often may be a comparison of
the vitamin or mineral content to a recognized source of the nutrient, e.g., ``contains more vitamin C than two 8 oz
glasses of orange juice.'' In addition, the comment maintained that the examples used in the proposed rule on nutrient
content claims for dietary supplements (58 FR 33731 at 33737) for comparing dissimilar foods within the same product
category (e.g., potato chips as a reference for pretzels) generally does not apply to dietary supplements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that a clarification is warranted to reinforce that &sect;101.13(j) applies to dietary supplements
as well as to foods in conventional food form. Section 101.13(j)(1)(i)(A) states that for ``less'' (or ``fewer'')
and ``more'' claims, the reference food may be a dissimilar food within a product category that can generally be substituted
for one another in the diet (e.g., potato chips as reference for pretzels) or a similar food (e.g., potato chips as reference
for potato chips). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that adding examples that are specific for dietary supplements will clarify that for ``less'' (or
``fewer'') and ``more'' claims, the reference food may be a dissimilar food within a product category for which the
labeled food can generally be substituted (e.g., orange juice as a reference for vitamin C tablet) or a similar food
(e.g., one brand of multivitamin as a reference for another brand of multivitamin). Accordingly, the agency is revising
&sect;101.13(j)(1)(i)(A) to include these examples.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, to clarify &sect;101.13(j)(1)(i)(B) for ``light,'' ``reduced,'' ``added,'' ``fortified,'' and
``enriched'' claims, the agency is revising this regulation to include an example of a reference food that is a similar
food (e.g., one brand of multivitamin for another brand of multivitamin).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. One comment agreed that the term ``modified'' would rarely be a useful term for vitamin/mineral supplements but
stated that this term might be useful for certain dietary supplements that contain ``other similar nutritional substances.''
The comment stated that there are techniques for concentrating certain fish oils that are high in omega-3 fatty acids.
The comment suggested that the use of the term ``modified'' might serve to distinguish products containing the concentrated
fish oils from other fish oil products that would have to be taken several times a day to provide the same amount of fish
oil and thus result in the consumption of significantly more calories. The comment argued that use of the term ``modified''
on dietary supplements should be authorized to maintain the principle of consistency between foods in conventional
food form and dietary supplements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees. FDA has defined ``modified'' for use as part of the statement of identity on foods to reflect the
fact that a change has been made in a food (56 FR 60421 at 60454). The term is not to be used alone, nor is the term to be used
to describe products that have not been altered (58 FR 2302 at 2367 and 2412). Based on the comment, the agency concludes
that this term may have some limited usefulness for dietary supplements, and thus this term may be used on such products
when they meet the conditions of &sect;101.13(k). FDA finds, however, that no change in &sect;101.13(k) is necessary
to authorize this use of the term.

5. Reference Amounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. One comment stated that if comparative claims (e.g., ``reduced sodium'') were to be made for dietary supplements,
there need to be reference amounts (i.e., reference amounts customarily consumed) established so that one product
recommending consumption of, for example, one tablespoon (tbsp) per day is not compared to a product recommending
five tbsp per day. The comment argued that the proposal allows very flexible reference amounts for supplements (i.e.,
whatever the manufacturer is recommending for consumption) and suggests that reference amounts of reference foods
(as established in &sect;101.13(j)) be specified in more concrete terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is not persuaded by the comment that more concrete terms are needed for reference amounts at this time. The
agency has established in the final rule on general requirements for nutrition labeling for dietary supplements
published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a definition for the reference amount customarily consumed for dietary supplements in &sect;101.12(b) as ``the
maximum amount recommended on the label for consumption per eating occasion or, in the absence of recommendations,
1 tablet, capsule, packet, or teaspoonful, as appropriate.'' This definition is based on comments received on the
proposal for mandatory nutrition labeling for dietary supplements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 101.13(p)(1), which FDA proposed to apply to dietary supplements, states that unless otherwise specified,
the reference amount customarily consumed set forth in &sect;101.12(b) through (f) shall be used in determining
whether a product meets the criteria for a nutrient content claim. The comment did not suggest an alternative to the
reference amount that could be used as the basis for comparative claims for dietary supplements. Therefore, given
the fact, as the agency said in the proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements (58 FR 33731 at 33732),
that a consistent approach to nutrient content claims on dietary supplements and on foods in conventional food form
will increase consumers' ability to use and understand such claims, FDA is not adopting a different approach to comparative
claims for dietary supplements than the one that it adopted for foods in conventional food form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency acknowledges that there is a potential for unfair marketing and misleading claims if the serving size is
manipulated upwards or downwards to enable a product to make a nutrient content claim. The agency retains the authority
to regulate any such misleading claims under section 403(a) of the act. Issues concerning serving size are further
discussed in the companion document on nutrition labeling for dietary supplements, published elsewhere in this
issue of the

A. Use of RDI's and DRV's in Formulating Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Many comments stated that limiting nutrient content claims to those nutrients with RDI's or DRV's was unnecessarily
restrictive. Several comments suggested that content claims should be authorized with respect to a nutrient as long
as it has either an RDI or DRV as established by FDA in &sect;101.9(c) or a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) as established
by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) (Ref. 4). Other comments also stated that nutrient content claims should
be authorized for nutrients for which NAS has established Estimated Safe and Adequate Daily Dietary Intakes (ESADDI's).
Other comments suggested that FDA should expand the number of vitamins and minerals with RDI's when it publishes the
final RDI/DRV rule following the expiration of the DS act moratorium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that the current list of RDI's does not represent the entire list of nutrients for which dietary recommendations
have been established. The agency had proposed to establish RDI's for all nutrients for which RDA's or ESADDI's were
provided in the 1989 edition of the NAS RDA's (56 FR 60366). However, under the DS act, the agency was constrained to
retain the label reference values established in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv) until at least November 8, 1993. These values
were based on the 1968 RDA's. The 1968 RDA's did not contain recommended dietary values for a number of nutrients for
which NAS has subsequently provided RDA's or ESADDI's. RDA's for vitamin K and selenium were established subsequent
to 1968 and are listed in the 1989 edition of the NAS RDA's (Ref. 4). Furthermore, the 1980 and 1989 editions of the NAS
RDA's provided ESADDI's for chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum. Now that the moratorium established
by the DS act has expired, the agency is proposing elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to establish RDI's for all nutrients for which RDA's or ESADDI's are provided in the 1980 and 1989 editions of the NAS's
Recommended Dietary Allowances but for which RDI's or DRV's have not been established by FDA. Once RDI's are established
for these additional seven nutrients, nutrient content claims may be made for them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA intends to consider revising all of the RDI's to conform to the most recent levels established by NAS. However,
FDA is aware that NAS is in the process of reevaluating the basis on which RDA's are determined. It is considering the
issue of whether values should be selected to prevent deficiencies or to promote optimal wellness. The agency believes
that its action should await completion of the NAS process. FDA is committed to working with NAS to help resolve this
issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, as stated in response to comment number 1 above, FDA has concluded that it is not possible to define nutrient
content claims for nutrients for which no reliable reference standards such as the RDI's and DRV's have been established.
The agency believes that authorization for nutrient content claims for nutrients for which no RDI or DRV exists (e.g.,
vitamin K) needs to be deferred until RDI's or DRV's are adopted. In the interim, quantitative nutrient information
may be listed in the nutrition label as discussed in the final rule on general requirements for nutrition labeling
for dietary supplements published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, manufacturers may provide amount or percentage statements as described in &sect;101.13(i)(3) for those nutrients
that do not have RDI's or DRV's. For example, while there is no RDI for fluoride, under this provision, manufacturers
may declare the amount of the nutrient present (e.g., 2 mg fluoride) on any panel outside of the Nutrition Facts box.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. One comment stated that claims should be permitted for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that claims regarding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene (e.g., ``contains 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene'') are claims about an ingredient that make implied representations about the level of vitamin A that is
present in the food as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene. This conclusion is consistent with section 403(r)(1)(A) of the act, which states that a food can be misbranded
by a statement that expressly or by implication characterizes the level of a nutrient in a food. The agency considers
that the claim ``contains 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene'' implies that there is enough 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene in the food to constitute a ``good source'' of vitamin A (i.e., it contains 10 percent or more of the DV for
vitamin A from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene). Such a claim is provided for in &sect;101.65(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. One comment advocated defining nutrient content claims for ultratrace nutrients including boron, silicon,
vanadium, arsenic, and tin. The comment stated that claims about these ultratrace elements should be permitted on
the basis of the RDA, ESADDI, or the amounts found in the average well-balanced diet. Additionally, this comment argued
that reference values should be available for ultratrace nutrients once reputable scientific evidence is established
that such nutrients serve important metabolic or physiological functions in the body. The comment also suggested
that label information be permitted for choline and inositol.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency disagrees. The trace elements arsenic, nickel, silicon, boron, cadmium, lead, lithium, tin, vanadium,
and cobalt, as well as choline and inositol, have not been shown to be essential in humans. No RDA's or ESADDI's for these
substances have been established by NAS. NAS states that several of these substances ``naturally present in foods
are known to be required in the diets of various animal or microbial species, but there is little or no evidence of their
dietary essentiality for humans'' (Ref. 4). While NAS acknowledges that some of these classes of substances may ``one
day be candidates for RDA's,'' it states that there is currently no evidence that these substances are essential in
humans (Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the ``Summary'' section of the 10th edition of the NAS RDA publication (Ref. 4), the NAS RDA's are based
not only on data from nutrient intake measurements but also on information from nutrient balance studies, experimental
intake studies, biochemical measurements, epidemiological observations of nutrient status, and extrapolation
of data from animal experiments. FDA does not agree with the comments that it is desirable to base label reference values
for nutrient content claims solely on individual scientific research publications, no matter how current, or solely
on data on amounts of the trace element found in well-balanced diets. The existence of such data does not mean that there
is scientific agreement on the essentiality of the nutrient or on the recommended level in the diet. Should agreement
on the essentiality of additional nutrients be reached, timely and appropriate changes to the label reference values
can be made through FDA's rulemaking procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as stated above, manufacturers are free to declare the amount of the trace elements, or choline or inositol,
on the product label outside of the ``Nutrition Facts'' panel in accordance with &sect;101.13(i)(3). Such a statement
of amount is not considered to characterize the level of the nutrient in the food, as would claims such as ``high'' or
``more.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. One comment stated that although no RDI's have been established for certain vitamins and minerals, nutrient content
claims could be based on reference foods that are recognized sources of those nutrients. For example, the label could
state that ``Brand X provides more vitamin K than two servings of cabbage,'' based on the vitamin K content of the reference
amount for vegetables without sauce listed in &sect;101.12, Table 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency disagrees. Until a reference standard is established there is no basis for confidence that cabbage is a
good source of vitamin K. There is also no basis for confidence that the amount of vitamin K in the food that is to be the
subject of the claim is nutritionally significant. Elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the agency has proposed to expand the list of nutrients with RDI's, including vitamin K. At this time, however, FDA
concludes that it would be premature to authorize such claims.

a. ``Good source'' and ``high'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. One comment encouraged the agency to maintain the proposed definitions for ``good source'' and ``high'' for dietary
supplements. The comment argued that a higher level (e.g., 40 percent of the RDI) would suggest to consumers that daily
nutrient intakes could be achieved by consuming only a few foods, which is inconsistent with dietary guidelines.
The comment maintained that if a new higher claim level was adopted for supplements, it would likely also apply to foods
in conventional food form based on the logic of the proposal for nutrient content claims for dietary supplements (i.e.,
consistency in definitions). The comment stated that users of dietary supplements are well aware of the elevated
nutrient levels in these products, and that a new paradigm is not needed to inform consumers of these levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, several comments did not support the proposal to use the same definitions for ``good source'' and
``high'' claims as those used for foods in conventional food form. The comments argued that the terms ``good source''
and ``high'' should not carry the same meaning for supplements as for foods in conventional food form, that most supplements
contain at least 100 percent of the Daily Value for most of the nutrients they provide, and that consumers expect most
of these products to contain at least 100 percent of the Daily Value. The comments maintained that allowing any product
with as little as 10 or 20 percent of the RDI to carry ``good source'' and ``high'' claims would confuse and mislead consumers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment questioned whether it is appropriate to permit the use of these nutrient content claims on vitamins and
mineral supplements since it implies that supplements are comparable to, and acceptable substitutes for, foods
in conventional food form. The comment also noted that nutrition educators feel strongly that supplements can enhance
the nutrient intake from foods in conventional food form but can never replace them since foods in conventional food
form provides other important components. On the other hand, many comments supported the proposal to extend the same
definitions for ``good source'' and ``high'' for foods in conventional food form to dietary supplements. These comments
emphasized the importance of consistency in definitions to assist consumer education.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested clarification on whether the terms ``good source'' and ``contains'' will be permitted for
dietary supplements. The comment maintained that such claims provide consumers with important information regarding
the precise content of various nutrients and should not be subject to discriminatory treatment solely on the basis
of whether such claims are made for a nutrient in a dietary supplement as opposed to one in a conventional food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has reviewed these comments and is not persuaded that the definition of the terms ``good source'' and ``high''
should be different for dietary supplements than for foods in conventional food form. The agency finds that the definitions
for foods in conventional food form and dietary supplements should be consistent. As directed by the 1990 amendments
(section 3(b)(1)(A)(iii)(VI)), FDA defined the term ``high,'' and the synonyms ``rich in'' and ``excellent source
of,'' for use on labels and in labeling in &sect;101.54 (58 FR 2302 at 2344). In &sect;101.54(c)(1) of final rule on
nutrient content claims, the agency stated that the term ``good source'' may be used to describe a food when a serving
of the food contains 10 to 19 percent of the RDI or the DRV for a nutrient. Likewise, the agency stated that the term ``high''
may be used to describe a food when a serving contains 20 percent or more of the RDI or the DRV. FDA concluded that the use
of these terms would permit a sufficient number of food items to bear ``good source'' and ``high'' claims to allow consumers
to use the claims in selecting foods that are better sources of nutrients (58 FR 2344). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While FDA recognizes that under the present definitions, most, if not all, dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals,
potassium, and fiber would qualify for ``good source'' or ``high'' claims, the agency does not agree with those comments
that argued that the definitions, as proposed, would be confusing or misleading to consumers. As suggested by the
IOM report on nutrition labeling (Ref. 6), the use of consistent and targeted content claims increases consumers'
confidence in the validity of the claim. FDA is aware of no evidence to support an alternate conclusion. The basic principle
of consistency in definitions of nutrient content claims is discussed in detail in comment 2 of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the agency recognizes that consumers expect dietary supplements to be concentrated sources of nutrients.
Consumer studies support this conclusion (Refs. 1 and 5). FDA acknowledges that the terms ``good source'' and ``high''
might be of limited utility in comparing nutrient content among dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals because
virtually the entire class of products would qualify for such claims. However, these terms may be useful for some single
source dietary supplements of calcium, biotin, or fiber or for multinutrient preparations containing these nutrients.
These nutrients are generally found in dietary supplements at levels below the Daily Value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, FDA believes that these terms would be useful in highlighting the nutrient content of some herbs and
other similar nutritional substances that have nutrients at levels high enough to qualify for the definition of one
of the above terms. For these reasons, the agency is not persuaded to preclude the use of these terms for dietary supplements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees with the comment that stated that dietary supplements cannot replace foods in conventional food
form in all respects because the latter foods supply other important components. However, FDA recognizes that dietary
supplements can be a useful part of the diet for those who wish to make sure that they consume at least the RDI amount for
all vitamins and minerals or for those who wish to increase their daily intake of a particular substance above those
levels that are ordinarily available from conventional foods. Thus, FDA finds that use of these terms on dietary supplements
is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is convinced that consistency in definitions of nutrient content claims across the food supply is necessary.
Consistency facilitates consumer education by limiting the number of terms that the public must learn and interpret.
Moreover, different definitions for the same terms for dietary supplements and foods in conventional food form would
be confusing to consumers because of the difficulties inherent in learning alternate definitions for the same term.
There is a greater chance of error and misinterpretation when several definitions must be learned for the same term.
Thus, different definitions would likely do more harm than good. Accordingly, the agency concludes that the proposed
definitions for ``good source'' and ``high'' are appropriate, and that there is no reason to define the terms differently
for dietary supplements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency would like to clarify that ``good source'' and ``contains'' as defined &sect;101.54(c)(1) are nutrient
content claims that can be used for foods in conventional food form as well as for dietary supplements. There is nothing
in this final rule that states that the use of these terms would not be allowed for dietary supplements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. One comment stated that under FDA's proposal, consumers who want truly high levels_that is, levels that exceed
the RDI_would have no means of identifying those products, other than reading the fine print on the back of each supplement
label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment acknowledged that consumers might also be confused if ``high'' had one meaning when the claim appears
on labels of dietary supplements and a different meaning when the claim appears on labels of foods in conventional
food form. To avoid that inconsistency, the comment urged FDA to prohibit the claims ``good source'' and ``high''
on supplements. Further, the comment suggested that the agency should define the term ``high potency'' and allow
it to be used only on supplements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees that the terms ``good source'' and ``high'' should be prohibited on the labels of dietary supplements.
The agency recognizes that a claim of ``high'' will not specifically identify those products that have levels of nutrients
that exceed the RDI. However, the quantitative amount of a nutrient in a dietary supplement is often a part of the statement
of identity for the product, and additional quantitative information regarding the level of a nutrient may also be
found in amount or percentage statements on the principal display panel. In addition, as a result of the agency's new
format requirements, the nutrition label for dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals provides quantitative
information on the levels of specific nutrients as well as the percent DV for each nutrient in a more legible format.
Consequently, consumers will have easy access to information regarding the levels of specific nutrients and may
adjust their levels of intake accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, as discussed in the previous comment, while the terms ``good source'' and ``high'' may be of limited utility
for dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals, these terms may be useful in highlighting the nutritional content
of single nutrients, such as biotin and calcium, that are generally found in products at levels well below the RDI,
as well as of dietary supplements of herbs and other similar nutritional products. Therefore, FDA concludes that
precluding the use of these terms on dietary supplements is unjustified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, FDA believes that there is a sufficient basis to consider defining the term ``high potency'' or some similar
term as a nutrient content claim. FDA's tentative view is that this term, or a similar term when defined, could provide
a way for manufacturers to describe the higher levels of nutrients in dietary supplements. (See comment 25 for further
discussion of this matter.)

b. ``More'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
16. One comment stated that consumers could be misled if comparative claims are made among high potency vitamin/mineral
supplements. The comment stated that if, for example, one brand of 300-mg vitamin B6 tablets claimed that it contained
``more'' than a competitive 250-mg product, then the consumer may get the misleading impression that the former product
is better. The comment maintained that as customers shop for supplements, they will be able to readily observe whether
one product is more potent than another without label claims suggesting superiority of one over another. If such a
claim resulted in better sales, then a ``horsepower race'' would ensue. The comment recommended that ``more'' claims
for vitamins and minerals not be allowed if the nutrient potency of the reference product already meets or exceeds
100 percent of the Daily Value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency acknowledges that there is the possibility that some manufacturers may choose to increase potencies in
order to make a ``more'' claim in comparison to another brand, but the agency disagrees that the limitation suggested
by the comment is warranted at this time. The agency points out that ``more'' claims for nutrients with an RDI or DRV,
including those products with nutrients in megadoses, such as those in the example cited by the comment, must include
the following information: The percentage (or fraction) that the nutrient was increased relative to the RDI or DRV,
the identity of the reference food, and the quantitative amount of the nutrient present (e.g., contains ``20 percent
more of the DV for vitamin B6 per tablet than product `x'. The vitamin B6 content of product `x' is 250 mg. This product
contains 300 mg vitamin B6.'') The nutrition label of a product containing 300 mg of vitamin B6 must state that the product
contains 1,500 percent of the Daily Value. The agency acknowledges that the amount of information required to make
a ``more'' claim is considerable, but such information is necessary to allow consumers to readily see how the amount
of a nutrient for which a ``more'' claim is made fits into the total daily diet. Furthermore, FDA believes that the concern
regarding ``horsepower races'' in dietary supplements stems from concerns of possible unfair marketing among manufacturers
as well as from safety concerns inherent in the addition of very high levels of nutrients to supplements. Similar concerns
with foods in conventional food form led to the establishment of FDA's fortification policy in 1980. This policy,
while published in &sect;104.20, does not have the force of a regulation. However, the agency has not found evidence
of widespread ``horsepower races'' with such foods. The agency urges industry, particularly industry associations,
to develop standards regarding nutrient levels and to monitor compliance with those standards to minimize any safety
problems.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
17. One comment from a trade association stated that the literal reading of section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act prohibits
giving prominence on the label of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals to ingredients that are not vitamins
or minerals. The comment argued that these prohibitions result in the withholding of information that is of interest
to consumers, and that it is increasingly common for manufacturers to market products that offer a combination of
vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary substances. The comment stated that the principal reason for the purchase
of these products is not their vitamin and mineral content but the other ingredients. The comment invited FDA to join
the supplement industry in seeking an amendment to section 411 of the act that will remedy this problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment disagreed with FDA's interpretation of section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act and suggested that this section
merely prohibits giving prominence or emphasis to such ingredients. The comment argued that nutrients other than
vitamins and minerals or sources of vitamins and minerals should be permitted to appear outside or immediately following
the nutrition label, providing that such information is not emphasized by, for example, being presented in type size
greater than that used in the nutrition label. The comment stated that such limited declarations would not conflict
with current provisions of the act and would be fair and reasonable means of communicating about the presence of ingredients
that provide added value to many dietary supplement products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is persuaded by these comments that a clarification of those sections of the proposal relating to section
411(b)(2)(B) of the act is needed. Section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act states that the labeling and advertising for dietary
supplements of vitamins and minerals may not give prominence to or emphasize ingredients that are not vitamins, minerals,
or represented as a source of vitamins or minerals. Because of this provision, nutrient content claims about ingredients
that are not vitamins or minerals (e.g., ``more fiber,'' ``high protein'') may not be made on dietary supplements
of vitamins or minerals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It must be emphasized that this provision pertains only to dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals. If, for example,
an herbal extract includes vitamins and minerals but is labeled as an herbal extract, in compliance with &sect;101.9
and other applicable provisions, and is advertised as such, section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act would not apply. The same
is true for a product that is primarily a protein supplement. A protein supplement with added vitamins and minerals
that is labeled and advertised as a protein supplement could declare that it is high in fiber. Such claims are permissible
as long as they are made in accordance with section 403(r) of the act, and they are not false or misleading in any particular.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act makes clear that in the labeling and advertising of dietary supplements
of vitamins and minerals, ingredients other than vitamins or minerals cannot be emphasized or given prominence.
FDA interprets prominence not solely as a function of type size. Declaring an ingredient outside or immediately following
the nutrition label is another means of giving prominence. For example, a statement such as ``5 g psyllium,'' except
in extremely limited circumstances, cannot be made on the principal display panel, outside the nutrition label,
or immediately following the nutrition label of a dietary supplement of vitamins and minerals because such placements
give prominence to that ingredient. However, the declaration of psyllium in the ingredient list would not be construed
as giving prominence to that ingredient. On the other hand, ``5 g psyllium'' could be declared in an amount statement
on the principal display panel, outside, or immediately following the nutrition label on protein supplements, on
dietary supplements of herbal extracts, and on dietary supplements of other similar nutritional substances so long
as these dietary supplements are not subject to section 411 of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that if a sugar is an ingredient in a dietary supplement of vitamins or minerals, claims about the amount
of sugar actually in the product would have to be restricted. However, ``sugar-free'' and ``no added sugar'' are absence
claims that assert that sugar is not an ingredient. The agency concludes that the use of these terms is acceptable on
dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals, as well as on other types of dietary supplements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of this clarification, the agency believes that section 411(b)(2)(B) of the act, as written, is sufficiently
flexible to accommodate claims on products that are not dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals. FDA believes
that it is therefore unnecessary to amend section 411 of the act.

2. Nutrient Content Claims for Sugar Content
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
18. One comment questioned the appropriateness of allowing ``sugar-free'' claims for a dietary supplement containing
less than 0.5 g of sugars. The comment stated that many supplements come in capsules or tablets that weigh slightly
less or not much more than 0.5 g, and therefore, supplements that are mostly sugars could use the term ``sugar-free.''
The comment suggested that the term ``sugar free'' on a dietary supplement should mean a much lower amount of sugars,
or that the product should be totally devoid of sugars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment also argued that terms such as ``negligible source of sugar,'' ``dietarily insignificant source of sugar,''
and ``trivial source of sugar'' are not synonymous with ``sugar-free'' because such terms connote the presence of
some sugar content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not persuaded by the comment that 0.5 g or less of sugars per serving is an inappropriate definition of insignificance
for sugars for dietary supplements. Section 101.60(c)(1) provides that for a food in conventional food form to make
a ``sugar free'' claim, the food must contain less than 0.5 g of sugars per reference amount. Less than 0.5 g of sugars
per reference amount is an amount that is consistent with the agency's policy of defining ``free'' claims at or near
the reliable limit of detection and in an amount that is dietetically inconsequential (56 FR 60421 at 60432). As a result,
even frequent consumption of a food bearing a ``sugar free'' claim would not result in an intake of sugars that would
affect the overall diet in any meaningful way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA acknowledges that there may be situations in which a dietary supplement may contain a significant proportion
of sugars on a weight basis and be able to make the claim ``sugar free.'' The agency believes, however, that even in such
instances, if the total amount of sugars in a serving of the product is less than 0.5 g, its net contribution to the total
daily diet would be inconsequential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, FDA considers it important that nutrient content claims correspond with the nutrition label, which
serves as a source of specific information for consumers concerning the nutritional value of the food. The nutrition
labeling regulations allow foods containing less than 0.5 g sugars per labeled serving to declare 0 g of sugars (&sect;&sect;101.9(c)(6)(ii)
and 101.36(b)(3)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA rejects the suggestion that it permit use of the term ``sugar free'' only where there is an absolute absence of sugars.
FDA believes that it is appropriate to apply the term ``free'' to a nutrient when a food contains that nutrient in a dietetically
trivial or physiologically inconsequential amount, even though the nutrient is present at a level at or near its reliable
limit of quantitation, because with modern analytical methods, the level at which the presence of a nutrient may be
quantified is becoming increasingly smaller (58 FR 2302 at 2320). The agency believes that it is appropriate to focus
on dietary insignificance, and very trivial amounts have no impact on the diet for the purpose of defining ``sugar
free.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also disagrees that the terms ``negligible source of sugar,'' ``dietarily insignificant source of sugar'',
and ``trivial source of sugar'' are inappropriate synonyms for ``sugar free.'' Section 403(r)(2)(A)(i) of the act
states that a nutrient content claim must be defined by regulation. In addition, section (3)(b)(1)(A)(ix) of the
1990 amendments provides that those regulations may include similar terms commonly understood to have the same meaning.
The agency is not aware of any reason why the above terms are inappropriate synonyms for ``sugar free.'' Although these
synonyms do not convey the absolute absence of sugar, they reflect that the amounts are dietetically trivial and of
no dietary significance. Therefore, the agency rejects this comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 19. One comment stated that the term ``no added sugar'' can be used only when a product is expected to contain sugar,
but that consumers do not know when supplements are expected to contain sugars. The comments suggested that FDA should
not preclude the use of the term ``no added sugars'' as this term would be useful to consumers in identifying those products
without sugar.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is persuaded that a review of the conditions for the use of the term ``no added sugar'' is warranted. FDA did
not propose to preclude the use of the term ``no added sugar'' on all dietary supplements. The agency finds that this
term is appropriate for some dietary supplements, such as children's chewable vitamins, that are frequently sweetened.
Section 101.60(c)(2) states that the terms ``no added sugar,'' ``without added sugar,'' or ``no sugar added'' may
be used only if: (1) No amount of sugars, as defined in &sect;101.9(c)(6)(ii), or any ingredient that contains sugars,
or that functionally substitutes for added sugars is added during processing or packaging, (2) the product does not
contain an ingredient containing added sugars, (3) the sugars content has not been increased above the amount present
in the ingredients by some means such as the use of enzymes, (4) the food that it resembles and for which it substitutes
normally is formulated with sugars, and (5) the product bears a statement that the food is not ``low calorie'' or ``calorie
reduced'' (unless the food meets the requirements for a ``low'' or ``reduced calorie'' food) and that directs consumers'
attention to the nutrition label for further information on sugar and calorie content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As is the case for foods in conventional food form, the agency believes that to avoid misleading consumers, the term
``no added sugar'' should be limited to dietary supplements that would be expected to contain added sugars. The agency
advises that the purpose of a ``no added sugar'' claim is to identify a food that differs from a similar food because
it does not contain the added sugars that would normally be present in the similar food. For this provision to be of practical
benefit to consumers, it must preclude the use of the claim on a food where the sugars that are normally added are replaced
with an ingredient that contains sugars that functionally substitute for the added sugars. Thus, the agency concludes
that the use of any ingredient that contains sugars that would normally be added to a food precludes the use of the ``no
added sugar'' nutrient content claim. The agency believes that claims concerning the absence of added sugars on products
that would not normally contain added sugar (e.g., dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals for adults) are likely
to mislead consumers into thinking that a particular brand may be more desirable when compared to other brands of the
same product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA acknowledges that consumers may not know every type of product that could be expected to contain sugar. However,
the final rule on nutrition labeling for dietary supplements published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 specifies that sugars will be listed in the ingredient label and must be declared in the nutrition label if present
in more than insignificant amounts. Through these provisions the consumer can readily ascertain which products
contain sugars.

C. Implied Nutrient Content Claims
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Claims That are not Nutrient Content Claims
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 101.65(b)(1) of the final rule on nutrient content claims provides that statements that declare the absence
of food components or ingredients that are not nutrients of the type required to be declared on the nutrition label,
and that are intended to facilitate avoidance for such reasons as food intolerance (e.g., lactose free), religious
beliefs, dietary practices such as vegetarianism or other nonnutrition related reason, (e.g., ``100 percent milk
free''), are not nutrient content claims. In the proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements, the
agency tentatively concluded that this paragraph is applicable to dietary supplements and requested comment on
other examples that are appropriate for dietary supplements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Comments suggested that other examples of terms in this category include the following: gluten free, wheat free,
corn free, yeast free, starch free, milk free, egg free, soy free, no artificial ingredients, nonirradiated, and
no synthetic ingredients. The comments requested that FDA confirm that these statements are allowed on the label.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the terms that were submitted in the comments other than ``egg free'' would constitute nutrient content claims.
The term ``egg free'' can be interpreted as an implied claim about cholesterol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency points out that it does not currently have a definition for ``artificial'' except as that term applies to
flavors and colors. Similarly, it has no definition for ``synthetic'' except as that term applies to flavors and colors.
Although these terms have not been defined by FDA, the agency believes that they are not nutrient content claims unless
they are used in a context in which they explicitly or implicitly describe the level of a nutrient. However, even if
these terms are not nutrient content claims, manufacturers who use them must make sure that their use is not false or
misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. FDA proposed to include dietary supplements in the coverage of &sect;101.65(b)(4). This section states that
when an ingredient constitutes essentially 100 percent of a food, so that the name of the ingredient is the statement
of identity, the name of the ingredient generally does not constitute an implied nutrient content claim unless it
is used in a context to suggest that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount. FDA used a statement of identity
for a dietary supplement in which an ingredient constitutes essentially 100 percent of a supplement (e.g. ``60 mg_vitamin
C'') as an example. One comment pointed out that 60 mg vitamin C tablets contain excipients (fillers, binders, lubricants,
disintegrants) other than vitamin C. The comment requested clarification as to whether, in the example of vitamin
C tablets, &sect;101.65(b)(4) requires that the amount claimed in the statement of identity constitute 100 percent
of the claimed amount of a food in &sect;101.65(b)(4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the example added to &sect;101.65(b)(4), the amount refers to the claimed nutrient. A tablet stating ``60 mg_vitamin
C tablets'' should contain 60 mg of that nutrient. The agency recognizes that a nutrient will not constitute precisely
100 percent of some dietary supplements, such as vitamin tablets or capsules, and advises that small amounts of excipients,
binders, lubricants, or disintegrants added for technological purposes are allowable in addition to the stated
nutrient content. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, FDA points out that under &sect;101.3(c), if a food is marketed in various optional forms, the particular
form is a necessary part of the statement of identity. Because vitamin C is marketed in tablet, capsule, and liquid
form, the form is part of the name. Therefore, this food should be called ``60 mg-vitamin C tablets.'' The agency acknowledges
an error in this regard in the proposal and is revising &sect;101.65(b)(4) to make the correction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. One comment stated that it is not unusual for a dietary supplement to contain several nutrients of one type and a
single nutrient of another type, such as ``multiple-vitamins with iron.'' The comment requested confirmation that
``with iron'' would not represent an implied nutrient content claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency advises that a term such as ``with iron,'' when used on the statement of identity of a supplement, is intended
to describe the nature of the food. When a statement of identity simply states ``with iron'' or specifies the amount
of iron in a product (e.g., ``multivitamin with 15 mg iron''), the statement is not a nutrient content claim. Such statements
fall under &sect;101.65(b)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as the agency stated in &sect;101.65(b)(5), there may be cases in which other statements on the label or labeling
would have the effect of making the statement into a nutrient content claim. For example, if the labeling of a multivitamin
with iron includes a discussion of the importance of iron in the diet, FDA believes the statement ``with iron'' would
be an implied claim that the multivitamin is a good source of iron. If the labeling is devoid of such information, FDA
would be unlikely to consider the name to be an implied nutrient content claim. The agency will evaluate such claims
on a case-by-case basis in the context of the entire label and labeling to determine whether they are nutrient content
claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. One comment maintained that FDA failed to address whether the currently used claim of ``high in antioxidants''
was within the scope of the proposed regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the term ``high in antioxidants'' was not explicitly discussed in the proposed regulations for nutrient content
claims for dietary supplements, the agency considers it to be an implied nutrient content claim that would come under
&sect;101.65. FDA's view is that this claim implies that the food on which it appears contains a ``high'' amount (i.e.,
at least 20 percent of the RDI, see &sect;101.54(b)(1)) of each antioxidant. One problem with this claim, however,
is that there is no established definition of ``antioxidants.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that a logical place to start in defining this term is section 3(b)(1)(A)(x) of the 1990 amendments. That
provision directed FDA to determine whether a health claim on antioxidant vitamins and cancer, could be authorized
under the standard that it established for dietary supplements under section 403(r)(5)(D) of the act. In its proposed
regulations to implement the 1990 amendments, in response to this provision, FDA considered the effects of vitamin
C, vitamin E, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene on cancer because these nutrients are the vitamins or provitamins that function as antioxidants (56 FR
60624, November 27, 1991). In the final rule on antioxidant vitamins and cancer, FDA concluded that its selection
of these nutrients was appropriate (58 FR 2622, January 6, 1993). Thus, the agency has determined that the direct-acting
antioxidant vitamins or provitamins include vitamin C, vitamin E, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene. Based on its review of the information presented at a recent conference entitled ``Antioxidant Vitamins
and Cancer and Cardiovascular Disease,'' which was initiated by FDA, the agency is not aware of any basis to expand
this list because the biological role of other vitamins as direct antioxidants has not been confirmed (Ref. 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it is arguable that FDA could authorize ``high in antioxidants'' as an implied claim pertaining to antioxidant
vitamins as a logical outgrowth of the proposal, because the claim applies to foods in conventional food form as well
as to dietary supplements, the agency believes that the better course is to propose to authorize such a claim. In addition,
the definition of ``antioxidants'' is not free from controversy. The agency is aware, based on its review of dietary
supplements whose labeling currently includes a ``high in antioxidant'' claim, that some manufacturers view this
term as including certain minerals. Antioxidant minerals have not been addressed by the agency, and, therefore,
final rules implementing the 1990 amendments do not provide for claims about them. Thus, FDA finds that a rulemaking
on the definition of ``antioxidants'' will provide an opportunity to establish the precise meaning of this term.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, FDA intends to address this issue as quickly as possible in a forthcoming proposal. Given that, elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the agency is establishing a date of applicability of July 5, 1995, for this regulation, FDA anticipates that there
is sufficient time to take final action on such a proposal before that date.

2. ``Healthier''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
24. One comment from a manufacturer observed that FDA proposed a regulation concerning use of the term ``healthy''
(proposed &sect;101.65(d)(2) (58 FR 2949)) in the January 6, 1993 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 2944 at 2949). The comment notes that ``healthy'' and similar terms are used in a variety of contexts. For example,
one of the manufacturer's dietary supplements is labeled as ``the way to
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
a healthier life.'' The comment suggested that this claim should not be deemed to be subject to the ``healthy'' definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA advises that it is in the process of finalizing regulations on the January 6, 1993, proposal for the claim ``healthy.''
The use of terms such as ``healthy,'' ``healthier,'' ``healthiest'' will be addressed in that final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its final rule on nutrient content claims, FDA concluded that a claim that a food, because of its nutrient content,
may be useful in maintaining healthy dietary practices is a claim that characterizes the level of a nutrient in that
food (58 FR 2302 at 2375). Accordingly, the agency provided in &sect;101.65(d)(1) that such statements are implied
nutrient content claims and are subject to the requirements of section 403(r) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the agency also stated that when a term such as ``healthy,'' ``wholesome,'' or ``nutritious'' appears on
a food label in a context that does not render it an implied nutrient content claim, it is not subject to the requirements
of section 403(r) of the act (58 FR 2302 at 2375). Under such conditions, the use of the term is subject to section 403(a)
of the act, and FDA will consider whether it is misleading on a case-by-case basis. The agency intends to give more specific
guidance in the final rule on ``healthy.''

1. General Nutrition Claims Such as ``High Potency,'' ``High Absorption,'' and ``Balanced''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. General issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements, FDA requested comment on terms, ``high potency,''
``high absorption,'' and ``balanced,'' which are often encountered on labels or in labeling of dietary supplements
and which seem to imply that the dietary supplement will contribute to good health (58 FR 33731 at 33748). The agency
requested comment on whether there are established meanings for these terms, and, if so, whether they characterize
the level of the nutrients in the food. FDA stated that if comments demonstrate that there are accepted definitions
used in the dietary supplement industry for these terms that characterize the level of nutrients, and that if it determines
that these definitions will assist consumers in maintaining healthy dietary practices, FDA will proceed with further
rulemaking to adopt the definitions or to propose new ones. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also stated that if the agency agrees that such terms are nutrient content claims, under the provisions of the statute,
such claims would be prohibited after the effective date for final rules, until such time as they are defined by FDA
by regulation. Further, FDA stated that if comments demonstrate that there are accepted definitions for these terms,
and they do not characterize the level of nutrients, in accordance with &sect;101.65(d)(1) such terms would not be
subject to section 403(r) of the act unless used in a nutritional context in association with an explicit or implicit
claim or statement characterizing the nutrient content of the food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. Several comments maintained that the terms ``high potency,'' ``high absorption,'' and ``balanced'' are implied
nutrient content claims and urged the agency to define or prohibit these terms. The comments stated that it is inappropriate
and fraught with possibilities for deception to allow each manufacturer to define such claims. One comment stated
that although these terms imply features of nutrient content to consumers, they do not have any established or useful
meaning with regard to dietary supplements. The comment argued that these terms seem to be more specific to dietary
supplements than to other food, so that their applicability in helping consumers make appropriate nutritional choices
from the variety of foods available seems limited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, several comments stated that these terms do not inherently refer to the level of nutrients, are not
nutrient content claims, and therefore should not be defined. These comments maintained that such terms are formulation
descriptions, which properly and truthfully describe the nature and type of the product. These comments contended
that these terms have been used for many years, and that consumers have come to understand that products so described
provide an amount of the primary nutrients in the formulation that is at least equal to the RDA's for those nutrients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment argued that FDA precedent exists for excluding such terms from regulation as nutrient content claims.
The comment stated that as formulation descriptions, these terms are useful to consumers in helping them to make product
choices, and manufacturers should be allowed to continue to use these terms in a manner that is consistent with FDA's
policy on claims such as ``maximum strength'' for internal analgesics in the over-the-counter drug review (i.e.,
kept outside the scope of this rulemaking). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that these terms seem to have more direct application to dietary supplements than to foods in conventional
food form. Furthermore, these terms may have some utility in helping consumers select among dietary supplements.
However, while these terms have apparently been used for years to imply superiority, the agency is uncertain what
they mean to consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency disagrees that these terms should be regulated in the same manner as terms such as ``maximum strength,''
which are used on the labels of over-the-counter drug products. The over-the-counter drug regulations include maximum
amount limitations. Section 411(a)(1)(A) of the act prohibits limits on the potency of dietary supplements of vitamins
or minerals except on the basis of safety. Therefore, the situations are not analogous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that each of these terms should be evaluated individually because they do not seem to be synonymous.
``High potency'' seems to focus on nutrient level or content, but ``balanced,'' as one comment suggested, seems to
be a formulation claim. ``High absorption'' seems to focus on how the body responds to the nutrient. The agency will
address each of these terms in more detail in the comments that follow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Definition for ``high potency''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
26. The majority of comments stated that the term ``high potency'' or ``full potency'' is an implied nutrient content
claim and should be defined. Several definitions were offered for this term. A few comments stated that multivitamins
and minerals are termed ``high potency'' when the majority of nutrients with established RDA's are present at the
levels equal to or in excess of the RDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, another comment stated that the term should be restricted to formulations that contain micronutrients
at levels of at least twice the applicable RDI or DRV because a multivitamin at 100 percent of the DV might be ``high potency''
compared to a food in conventional food form but not ``high potency'' when compared to other dietary supplements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment suggested that FDA should require a ``high potency'' single-ingredient supplement to contain at
least twice the RDI, and that the front of the label should disclose what multiple of the RDI the supplement contains.
The comment acknowledged that under this scheme, some nutrients, such as calcium and selenium, would not qualify
to carry a ``high potency'' claim, because they are rarely sold at double the RDI. The comment suggested that if the
supplement industry begins to market those supplements at higher doses in order to make ``high potency'' claims,
then FDA could establish a lower minimum level, such as 50 percent more than the RDI for selenium or 50 percent of the
RDI for calcium. Those minimum levels would apply to those nutrients only. The comment also suggested that FDA should
allow ``high potency'' claims on multinutrient supplements when more than one-third of the nutrients that they contain
meet the minimum level required for a high potency claim, and the label discloses which nutrients are present at high
levels. For example, the label of a ``high potency'' multivitamin could carry an asterisk next to the claim, with the
following disclosure: ``contains high levels of [number] vitamins.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the comment stated that it is not reasonable to require that all of the nutrients in a multinutrient supplement
be present at levels that are necessary for high potency claims because many nutrients are not_and should not_be sold
in such high doses. For example, the comment suggested that ``high potency'' claims should be allowed on a multivitamin-and-mineral
supplement that contains at least double the RDI of vitamins A, C, E, B6, B12, thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin but smaller
amounts of vitamin D, iron, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and copper. The comment stated that the latter nutrients are
typically sold at doses lower than double the RDI and may pose a risk at high levels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has reviewed the comments and is persuaded that ``high potency'' is a claim that characterizes the level of a nutrient
and therefore meets the definition in &sect;101.13(b) of a nutrient content claim. FDA also is persuaded by the comments
that this is a term that FDA should define in order to ensure that it will be useful to consumers in maintaining healthy
dietary practices. However, given the range and diversity of the suggested definitions, the agency is not prepared
to offer a definition of ``high potency'' at this time. FDA intends to review the suggestions it received on this issue
and based on information received in comments, issue a proposed rule on an appropriate definition of ``high potency.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that there is a need to provide this definition as quickly as possible. Therefore, FDA intends to act
on this matter as expeditiously as its resources allow.

c. Definitions for ``high absorption''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
27. A couple of comments stated that the term ``high absorption'' does not refer to the level of nutrients but rather
to bioavailability or how efficiently the nutrients are released from the product and absorbed into the bloodstream.
One comment stated that ``high absorption'' means that the product meets the definition for ``high,'' and that a ``high
amount'' is digested and assimilated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment stated that from a biological viewpoint, the extent to which nutrients are absorbed from food or supplements
depends not only on the chemical form of the nutrient itself but on the chemical environment presented by the carrier
food in which it is contained and on the physiological state of nutrient need of the individual consumer. Given these
factors, the comment stated that it is difficult to provide a meaningful definition of absorbability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested that the label should disclose information about the bioavailability of the product. Another
comment suggested that FDA should allow labels to make ``high absorption'' or similar claims only when the manufacturer
supplies bioavailability data showing that the product is better absorbed than a standard supplement. The comment
stated that the agency should not allow this claim on supplements that simply meet or exceed the United States Pharmacopeial
Convention's (USP's) (or other) standards for disintegration or dissolution, because meeting those standards
does not ensure that the product is well absorbed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency agrees that the term ``high absorption'' generally refers to how well a nutrient is absorbed into the system.
A product can be well absorbed irrespective of the quantitative amount found in the product. Accordingly, FDA finds
that ``high absorption'' is not a nutrient content claim and thus will not define this term. The use of this term is subject
to section 201(n) and 403(a) of the act, however. The agency expects that any product bearing a ``high absorption''
claim will contain the nutrients that are the subject of the claim in a form than can be readily assimilated by the body.
In addition, manufacturers who make a ``high absorption'' claim should have data available to support the claim and
should be prepared to make such data available to regulatory officials on request. Failure to do so could lead the agency
to conclude that there is no basis for the claim, and thus that it is false or misleading.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
d. Definitions for ``balanced''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
28. A few comments stated that ``balanced'' is not a nutrient content claim. One comment suggested that ``balanced''
refers to the ratio of nutrients, not the level, and that the term can apply equally to products containing low or high
quantities of nutrients. Another comment stated that there is little need for FDA to define ``balanced'' because
most multinutrient supplements that are currently on the market do not contain nutrients in proportions that would
impair the absorption or utilization of other nutrients. The comment suggested that until researchers gain further
information on the most favorable proportions of nutrients in supplements, the agency should leave this term undefined
and therefore prohibited. Another comment suggested that ``balanced'' be defined as any supplement containing
from 50 to 150 percent of the RDI for each vitamin and mineral component of the product for which an RDI has been established.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is persuaded by the comments that the term ``balanced'' does not typically characterize the level of nutrients,
but rather that it is a formulation claim that addresses the ratio of nutrients. The term ``balanced'' may be used in
different ways, each of which relates to the formulation of a product. For example, the term ``balanced'' may refer
to the assortment of nutrients that are present in a product, or it may reflect interactions between the nutrients
present, such as sparing effects or impairment or enhancement of absorption. Accordingly, this term does not meet
the definition for a nutrient content claim in &sect;101.13(b). Therefore, the use of the term ``balanced'' is subject
to sections 403(a) and 201(n) of the act and not section 403(r) of the act. The agency will determine whether the use
of this term is misleading on a case-by-case basis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
e. Temporary suspension of the use of terms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
29. One comment stated that use of the terms ``high potency,'' ``high absorption,'' and ``balanced'' should not be
suspended temporarily during the rulemaking process because such a suspension would result in unnecessary labeling
costs. Another comment requested additional time to comment on the definition of ``high potency'' and suggested
that until FDA defines this term, the agency should permit dietary supplement manufacturers to continue to use this
term as it is currently being used. The comment suggested that as an executive agency, FDA has inherent authority to
refrain from enforcing a statutory provision in circumstances in which the enforcement would do more harm than good.
The comment argued that to the extent that ``high potency'' is being used as part of a brand name (and was being used before
October 25, 1989), the 1990 amendments permit its continued use in the brand name until FDA has defined the term (section
403(r)(2)(C) of the act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment argued that there is no reason for FDA to prohibit the use of a nutrient content claim while a definition
is being developed. Further, the comment noted that an enforcement moratorium would avoid the relabeling problem
that would arise if FDA disapproves and then reapproves use of the term within a short period of time. The comment stated
that FDA will continue to have authority to prohibit use of the term when such use is false or misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that it intends to define ``high potency'' as a nutrient content claim in a separate rulemaking as quickly
as possible. The agency is postponing the date that it will apply this final rule on nutrient content claims on dietary
supplements until July 1, 1995. This postponement is discussed in detail in the document on the date of application
for the nutrition labeling and nutrient content claim requirements for dietary supplements found elsewhere in this
issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. FDA intends to complete its rulemaking on ``high potency'' in sufficient time to assure implementation by the time
that dietary supplement manufacturers will be required to comply with the nutrient content claim provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also advises that the term ``high potency,'' when used as part of a brand name, would fall under section 403(r)(2)(C)
of the act, if as the comment stated, it was used as part of the brand name before October 25, 1989. However, once this
term is defined by the Secretary, it will have to be used in a manner that complies with that definition. In addition,
use of the term in the brand name is subject to section 403(a) of the act, which prohibits the use of false and misleading
labeling irrespective of whether the use of the term in the brand name is exempt under section 403(r)(2)(C) of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed previously, the comments did not demonstrate that there are accepted definitions for any of these terms.
However, the comments have convinced the agency that the terms ``high absorption'' and ``balanced'' do not generally
characterize the level of nutrients. Accordingly, the agency concludes that these terms are not subject to section
403(r) of the act.

4. Age Specific Claims
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
30. One comment stated that there are products with brand names that imply that the product is especially useful for
a particular segment of the population. The comment argued that it would therefore be appropriate for FDA to require
that these special formulas comply with clearly defined requirements (e.g., that they contain high amounts of particular
vitamins and minerals that are needed by the relevant group). Another comment maintained that such names mislead
consumers because they provide no explanation for those special population claims, and that in many cases, the supplements
do not contain levels of nutrients that are appropriate for the special population named in the claim. The comment
suggested that FDA should, at the very least, require labels to provide an explanation for these claims. For example,
an explanation for a product with a brand name implying that it is useful for women might state that ``this product is
especially suited for young women because it contains 100 percent of the RDI for folic acid and iron and 30 percent of
the RDI for calcium.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that products marketed for special population groups may include claims or brand names that can be misleading.
These claims and brand names seem to imply a particular benefit for certain subgroups of the population and often do
not disclose how or why they meet the needs of that particular subgroup. Disclosure of such facts would help to protect
a product from being misbranded under section 403(a) of the act because its labeling would reveal material facts about
the product's claimed special usefulness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, such claims about the usefulness of a product for particular population groups generally fall under section
403(j) of the act to the extent that they represent the product to be for special dietary use. As special dietary use
claims, they are outside the scope of this rulemaking. Among other things, &sect;105.3 defines ``special dietary
uses'' as ``uses for supplying particular dietary needs which exist by reason of a physical, physiological, pathological
or other condition, including but not limited to the conditions of disease, convalescence, pregnancy, lactation,
allergic hypersensitivity to food, underweight, and overweight; [and] [u]ses for supplying particular dietary
needs which exist by reason of age, including but not limited to the ages of infancy and childhood'' (&sect;105.3(a)(1)(i)
and (a)(l)(ii)). The agency intends to consider proposing regulations for such products. However, because of resource
constraints and other agency priorities, any such proposal will not be available in the immediate future. In the interim,
such claims will continue to be subject to the general misbranding provisions of sections 201(n) and 403(a) of the
act.

5. ``Natural''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
31. Several comments suggested that FDA define the term ``natural'' for dietary supplements because that term is
widely used in the labeling of dietary supplements even though there is no established definition of that term, and
it is misleading as it is now used. For example, one comment stated that studies indicate that natural vitamin E (d-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
alpha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 tocopherol) is better utilized than synthetic vitamin E (dl-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
alpha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and other tocopherols), but that ``natural'' claims now appear on products containing synthetic vitamin E, misleading
consumers who think they are getting a better utilized product. The comment stated that in other instances, companies
use the term ``natural'' to mean that the product contains no artificial ingredients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment acknowledged that FDA has struggled with how to define this term for foods in conventional food form. This
comment suggested that the agency need not resolve the dilemma at this time, but that it should simply establish a supplement-specific
definition, just as FDA has established a special definition for ``natural flavor'' in &sect;101.22. Another comment
suggested that FDA should allow ``natural'' claims on products containing only the naturally occurring form of a
vitamin. The comment suggested that FDA could request comments about whether to limit ``natural'' claims to nutrients,
such as vitamin E, that appear to offer some advantage when consumed in a natural form. The comment also stated that
many consumers will want the option of purchasing other nutrients in the natural form as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not persuaded by the comments that the term ``natural'' should be defined at this time. As one comment acknowledged,
the agency has recently expended its resources exploring the use of this term, and it was unable to arrive at an acceptable
definition (58 FR 2302 at 2407). FDA currently lacks sufficient resources to thoroughly explore and develop proposed
regulations for the use of this term on dietary supplements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule on nutrient content claims, the agency determined that it would maintain its current policy (as discussed
in the general principles proposal (56 FR 60421 at 60466) of interpreting this term to mean that nothing artificial
or synthetic (including all color additives regardless of source) has been included in, or has been added to, a food
(Ref. 7). FDA also decided that it would continue to distinguish between natural and artificial flavors as outlined
in &sect;101.22. The agency concludes that, for the reasons cited above, it is appropriate to apply this policy to
dietary supplements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this regard, FDA also points out that &sect;101.9(k)(6) states that a food labeled under the provisions of this
section shall be deemed to be misbranded under sections 201(n) and 403(a) of the act if its label or labeling represents,
suggests, or implies, ``that a natural vitamin in a food is superior to an added or synthetic vitamin or to differentiate
in any way between vitamins naturally present from those added.''

V. Other Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA did not receive any comments that dealt specifically with the other provisions of the proposal. In the absence
of any basis for doing otherwise, FDA is adopting those provisions as proposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its dietary supplement labeling proposals of June 18, 1993, FDA stated that the proposed rules on the labeling of
dietary supplements, taken as a whole, would have associated costs of approximately $20 million. Thus, the agency
concluded that the proposed rules would not constitute a major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291. In accordance
with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354), FDA explored whether the proposed rules may have a significant
impact on small businesses and tentatively concluded that they do not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has evaluated the many comments that it received in response to its economic impact analysis. Because the issues
raised in the comments relate to all three proposals, FDA has combined its discussion of these comments and presented
them in the final rule regarding the date of application published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has examined the economic implications of the final rules amending 21 CFR as required by Executive Order 12866
and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available
regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits
(including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity).
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires the agency to analyze options for regulatory relief for small businesses.
FDA has concluded, based on its review of the available data and comments, that these final rules are not significant
as defined by Executive Order 12866. Further, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies
that these final rules will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses.

VII. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(11) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the June 18, 1993, proposal on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements (58 FR 33731 at 33749), FDA announced
that the agency had submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review the collection of information
requirements contained in proposed &sect;101.69, for petitions regarding the use of nutrient content claims in
conjunction with food labeling on dietary supplements. Also in that document, FDA published its estimated annual
collection of information burden for this provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the more than 500 comments received in response to the dietary supplement proposal addressed the content of
petitions under the proposed nutrient content claim petition requirements. Thus, the agency's estimated annual
reporting and recordkeeping burden from the health claim petition requirements contained in this final rule remains
unchanged from that announced in June.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has submitted copies of the final rule to OMB for its review of these reporting requirements.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its food labeling regulations to make dietary supplements of vitamins,
minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances (dietary supplements) subject to the same general requirements
that apply to all other types of food with respect to the use of health claims that characterize the relationship of
a substance to a disease or health-related condition on the label or in labeling and the content of petitions for obtaining
authorization for such health claims. This action is being taken in response to provisions of the Nutrition Labeling
and Education Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments) and the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 (the DS act) that bear on health
claims.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 8, 1990, President Bush signed into law the 1990 amendments (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535). This new law amended
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) in a number of important ways. One of the notable aspects of the 1990
amendments is their confirmation of FDA's authority to regulate health claims on food labels and in food labeling.
The new provisions amended the act by adding a provision, section 403(r)(1)(B) (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(B)), that provides
that a product is misbranded if it bears a claim that characterizes the relationship of a nutrient to a disease or health-related
condition, unless the claim is made in accordance with sections 403(r)(3) of the act (which pertains to foods in conventional
food form) or 403(r)(5)(D) (which pertains to dietary supplements). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress enacted the health claims provisions of the 1990 amendments to help U.S. consumers maintain healthy dietary
practices and to protect these consumers from unfounded health claims. The House Report of June 13, 1990, states,
``Health claims supported by significant scientific agreement can reinforce the Surgeon General's recommendations
and help Americans to maintain a balanced and healthful diet'' (Ref. 1). In addition, the statement of the House Floor
Managers noted that ``There is a great potential for defrauding consumers if food is sold that contains inaccurate
or unsupportable health claims'' (Ref. 2). The House Report characterized the need for regulation of health claims
as ``compelling'' (Ref. 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's first step to effect the health claims provisions of the 1990 amendments appeared in the form of a November 27,
1991, proposed health claims regulation (56 FR 60537) (hereinafter referred to as ``the health claims proposal'').
That document proposed to establish general requirements pertaining to the use of health claims that characterize
the relationship of a food component to a disease or health-related condition on the labels and in labeling of both
foods in conventional food form and dietary supplements. The health claims proposal contained definitions to clarify
the meaning of specific terms used in the regulations, preliminary requirements that a component of food must meet
to be eligible to be the subject of a health claim, a scientific standard for assessing the validity of claims, general
labeling requirements for health claims that are permitted by regulation, and prohibitions on certain types of health
claims. Also, the health claims proposal contained provisions pertaining to the required content of petitions for
health claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the health claims proposal, FDA received over 6,000 letters, each containing one or more comments,
from consumers, health care professionals, universities, State and local governments, foreign governments, trade
organizations, consumer advocacy organizations, research institutes, industry, and professional organizations.
Many of the comments pertained to dietary supplements. The agency summarized and addressed the issues raised in the
comments in the final rule on health claims that published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2478) (hereinafter referred to as ``the health claims final rule''). The health claims final
rule became effective on May 8, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the health claims proposal pertained to dietary supplements as well as foods in conventional food form,
the final rule applied only to the latter type of foods. In October of 1992, Congress passed the DS act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;571),
which imposed a moratorium on FDA implementation of the 1990 amendments with respect to dietary supplements until
December 15, 1993. The DS act provides that by June 15, 1993, FDA was to have issued proposed rules to implement the 1990
amendments with respect to dietary supplements, and that by December 31, 1993, the agency is to issue final rules based
on these proposals. The DS act also amends the 1990 amendments to reflect the fact that if the agency does not issue final
rules with respect to health claims for dietary supplements by December 31, 1993, the proposed regulations are to
be considered final regulations at that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33700), FDA responded to the DS act by issuing a proposal that sets forth a standard and procedure
for making health claims for dietary supplements (hereinafter referred to as ``the dietary supplement health claims
proposal''). In that proposal, FDA proposed to make health claims on dietary supplements subject to the same general
requirements that apply to health claims on all other types of food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the dietary supplement health claims proposal, FDA received over 1,200 letters, each containing one
or more comments, from consumers, health care professionals, universities, State and local governments, trade
organizations, consumer advocacy organizations, research institutes, industry, and professional organizations.
Some comments agreed with one or more provisions of the proposed rule without providing further grounds for support
other than those provided by FDA in the preamble to the proposal. Other comments disagreed with one or more provisions
of the proposal without providing specific grounds for their disagreement. Many comments addressed issues that
are beyond the scope of these regulations and will not be addressed in this document. For example, some responded to
various aspects of FDA's June 18, 1993, advance notice of proposed rulemaking concerning the general regulation
of dietary supplements (58 FR 33690). Most of the comments, however, addressed the proposed regulations and provided
specific grounds in support of their positions. The agency has summarized and addressed the issues raised in the comments
in the discussion that follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

II. Regulatory Approach
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Approach Based on FDA's Review of the 1990 Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1990 amendments did not provide a specific standard for when a health claim should be authorized on dietary supplements
or a specific procedure for authorizing such claims. Under section 403(r)(5)(D) of the act, the establishment of
such a standard and such a procedure is left to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)
(and, by delegation, FDA). Thus, in the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33702), FDA reviewed
the legislative history of the 1990 amendments to identify the features that Congress intended would guide the agency's
choice of a scientific standard and procedure for regulating health claims on dietary supplements. FDA identified
the following features that it believes should guide its choice:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
o The regulations are to deal only with the procedure and standard for health claims for the substances in dietary supplements.
They are to have no bearing on the availability of any dietary supplements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
o The regulations must prohibit the use of health claims that are not authorized under their provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
o The regulations must ensure that any health claims that appear in labeling are scientifically valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
o The regulations must ensure that any health claims that appear in labeling are understandable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
o The regulations should be such that all segments of the food industry are treated fairly and in a consistent manner,
unless there is an appropriate basis on which to draw a distinction. This factor embodies a principle of equity implicitly
in the act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With these features in mind, FDA considered all of the approaches of which it was aware that might be used to regulate
dietary supplements. The agency tentatively concluded that it should adopt an approach that would subject dietary
supplements to the same standard that applies to foods in conventional food form. FDA stated that it was its tentative
view that that approach strikes the appropriate balance between the congressional concern for consumer fraud, public
health, and sound science, on the one hand, and the desire to provide the consumer with information on the other. Furthermore,
the agency advised that if it adopts this standard for dietary supplements, all foods will be regulated under the same
standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA pointed out that under the same procedure that applies with respect to claims for substances in food in conventional
food form, there is a premarket review that ensures that the safety of the substance that is to be the subject of the claim
has been established as well as the scientific validity of the claim. A claim linking a substance to a disease, whether
on a food in conventional food form or on a dietary supplement, is intended to increase intake of that substance. Thus,
the agency said, it is important to ensure that a claim encouraging such increased intake can be safely implemented.
Therefore, FDA proposed to adopt the same procedure for health claims for dietary supplements as for foods in conventional
food form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Availability of Dietary Supplements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. A great many comments, primarily from consumers, raised objections that indicated that the commenters were misinformed
about the proposed regulations, or that they simply did not believe what FDA stated in the dietary supplement proposal.
Many of the comments expressed considerable anger, resentment, and even fear over the proposal. A large number of
these comments characterized the proposal as an attack against the dietary supplement industry. Many of these comments
stated that FDA is plotting to ban all dietary supplements. A number of comments explained that the proposed regulations
would limit the number of dietary supplements available to consumers by limiting the amount of health information
that could appear on supplement labels and thus diminish supplements' marketability. The comments maintained that
FDA's proposed policy of requiring premarket review of a supplement's safety is contrary to the agency's stated intent
to preserve supplement availability and consumer choice. Some of the comments maintained that many manufacturers
would be put out of business. Many of the comments argued that the nation's health would be adversely affected, and
that health care costs would increase without dietary supplements to maintain good health. Some comments contained
testimonials that certain dietary supplements were responsible for curing and preventing a variety of diseases,
including cancer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a few comments pointed out that assertions that FDA plans to ban dietary supplements are unfounded. A number
of these comments predicted that the vast majority of dietary supplements will remain in the marketplace because
about 80 percent of supplement labels are already in compliance with the proposed provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no basis for virtually all of the concerns raised in the comments about the availability of dietary supplements.
Nothing in these regulations will make them unavailable to consumers. These regulations focus only on ensuring that
health claims, if made on the labels or in the labeling of dietary supplements, are scientifically valid and understandable.
Thus, the availability of dietary supplements will not be affected by these regulations. While it is likely that some
claims may have to be removed from product labeling as a result of this final rule, the products themselves can continue
to be marketed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is true that prohibiting the use of claims that have not been authorized by FDA may have an adverse impact on the marketability
of some products. However, any such impact is outweighed by the need to assure consumers that the claims that are made
in labeling are scientifically valid, and that they can rely on such claims. In fact, the only products whose marketability
will ultimately suffer under these regulations will be those whose labeling has borne claims that cannot be supported
by the available scientific evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement that the agency be confident that the presence of a health claim will not result in unsafe intakes of
the substance that is the subject of the claim is not inconsistent with supplement availability and consumer choice.
If a manufacturer does not choose to make a claim about a substance, nothing in these regulations will affect the manufacturer's
ability to continue to market supplements that contain that substance. FDA believes, however, that it has an obligation
to ensure that before it authorizes a claim that encourages consumers to increase their consumption of a substance,
it have some assurance that increased consumption of that substance will not be harmful.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Fair and Consistent Treatment of All Segments of the Food Industry
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Many comments asserted that FDA has not been evenhanded in its approval of health claims for use on dietary supplements
and on foods in conventional food form. Some of these comments maintained that FDA's unfair treatment of dietary supplements
is evidenced by the agency's approval of health claims involving cancer and coronary heart disease for use on fruits,
vegetables, and grain products but not for use on fortified foods or supplements that provide fiber or antioxidant
vitamins. The comments stated that FDA should authorize health claims involving particular nutrients for use on
any food that contains those nutrients, including dietary supplements, unless there is significant scientific
agreement that the claim is valid only when the nutrient is consumed in a particular form. To ensure that such an approach
is taken in evaluating health claims for use on dietary supplements in the future, a few comments requested that FDA
add the following provision to the end of &sect;101.14(g) (21 CFR 101.14(g)):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A health claim that has been approved for any substance that is to be consumed at other than decreased dietary levels
shall be permitted on all foods (including dietary supplements) containing the requisite amounts of that substance,
unless FDA determines that (i) there is significant scientific agreement (as defined in subparagraph (c)) that the
consumption of the substance in the particular food will not provide the benefits claimed, or (ii) the food contains
disqualifying amounts of another substance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few comments contended that FDA also has treated dietary supplements unfairly by withholding approval of a health
claim concerning the role of folic acid in reducing the risk of neural tube defects (NTD's) simply because of its concerns
that allowing the claim on foods in conventional food form would raise safety issues because of overfortification
of the food supply and the subsequent effect on certain subpopulations. These comments asserted that the proper course
of action for the agency would have been to allow health claims on dietary supplements but to prohibit their use on foods
in conventional food form until the public health concerns associated with such use had been resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a few comments supported FDA's decision to approve particular health claims for use on fruits, vegetables,
and fiber-containing grains while not authorizing their use on dietary supplements or fortified foods with added
antioxidant vitamins or fiber. These comments noted that there are many compounds in fruits and vegetables that may
be involved in reducing the risk of disease that may not have been identified. The comments asserted that before allowing
a dietary supplement to bear a health claim authorized for use on food in conventional food form, it is important to
establish that the supplement provides the same health protection benefits as the conventional food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the assertions in the comments that it has been unfair with the dietary supplement industry with
respect to its approval of specific health claims. FDA believes that the health claims should be consistent with the
scientific evidence available to the agency. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2537, 2552, and 2622), FDA explained why it was authorizing health claims pertaining to: (1)
Heart disease and diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that
contain fiber; (2) cancer and diets low in fat and high in fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber;
and (3) cancer and diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables that may contain fiber, vitamin A (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene) and vitamin C. The agency also explained in detail why it was not authorizing health claims pertaining
to any specific nutrients (i.e., heart disease and dietary fiber, cancer and dietary fiber, and cancer and antioxidant
vitamins). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of the antioxidant vitamins, FDA found that although there was sufficient evidence to justify a health
claim concerning the relationship between diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables that may contain fiber,
vitamin A, and vitamin C and a reduced risk of cancer, the available evidence did not provide a basis on which to attribute
the reduction in risk of disease to any individual vitamin or combination of vitamins, regardless of whether the vitamin
is classified as an antioxidant or not (see discussion under section IV., 58 FR 2622 at 2633). Yet, because of the usefulness
of vitamins A (as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
beta
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-carotene) and C and dietary fiber in identifying those fruits and vegetables that correlate with reduced cancer
risk, FDA identified these nutrients as being characteristic of the foods associated with a protective effect. Any
one or a combination of these three nutrients can serve as the identifying marker. Moreover, because fruits and vegetables
are also characterized by an absence of fat, and because of the identified relationship of low fat diets to reduced
risk of cancer, FDA highlighted low fat intakes as part of the dietary pattern associated with decreased cancer risk.
Because the mechanism of the protective effect of fruits and vegetables is not known, and because it is not possible
to determine which of the nutrients or other components in fruits and vegetables is causing the observed effect, the
health claim authorized by FDA focuses on fruits and vegetables as a class of foods and their relationship to cancer
risk, and not on particular nutrients. By requiring that all characterizing nutrients be identified as characteristic
of dietary patterns rich in fruits and vegetables without specifically attributing reduced cancer risk to a single
nutrient or single type of nutrient (antioxidant vitamins), FDA made the claim consistent with the scientific knowledge
available to it at the time it authorized the claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the rapidly evolving science base relative to this topic, however, FDA has continued to update its evaluation
of the scientific evidence and the degree of scientific agreement on the relationship between antioxidant vitamins
and cancer. As part of these efforts, FDA initiated, along with other major research and health organizations as cosponsors,
a public conference on antioxidant vitamins and cancer and cardiovascular disease that was held on November 1 through
3, 1993. The transcript of that meeting has been submitted to the Docket as a comment on the antioxidant vitamins and
cancer rulemaking, along with other comments received in response to the announcement of the conference (58 FR 54595,
October 22, 1993). FDA is reviewing the results of this conference and other scientific evidence that has become publicly
available since the publication of the January 6, 1993, final rule on antioxidant vitamins and cancer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, in the case of heart disease and dietary fiber and of cancer and dietary fiber, the agency found that there
was insufficient evidence to attribute the reduction in risk specifically to dietary fiber or to specific fiber components.
The agency did conclude, however, that dietary fiber and soluble fiber, along with other nutrients, serve as useful
markers in identifying those foods for which the scientific evidence showed that inclusion in a daily diet was associated
with reduced risk of cancer and of heart disease (58 FR 2552 and 58 FR 2537).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For both topic areas, the agency also noted the inability of commonly used analytical methodologies to detect many
of the characteristics that vary among dietary fibers and that may be related to biological function (e.g., particle
size, chemical composition, water-holding capacity). With regard to heart disease, other components variable
associated with soluble fiber in foods (e.g., lipid components) may also contribute to a cholesterol-lowering effect.
FDA found that the inability to detect many of the differences among fibers, fiber components, and other substances
in foods that contain dietary fibers, including soluble fiber, and the general lack of conclusions as to the mechanism
of action of dietary fibers and fiber components were limiting factors on FDA's ability to draw conclusions from the
available evidence. Furthermore, FDA noted that foods high in dietary fiber are also generally low in calories and
total fat, factors that are associated with reduced risk of cancer. Fiber-rich foods are also generally low in saturated
fats and cholesterol, substances that also affect the risk of developing heart disease. Thus, some or all of the benefits
associated with diets high in fiber-rich foods could be the result of displacement of fat and saturated fat from the
total diet rather than an effect of fiber per se.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency stated that although the specific roles of the numerous potentially protective substances or displacement
of negative substances (e.g., fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol) in such plant foods are not yet understood, populations
with diets rich in these foods experience many health advantages, including lower rates of heart disease and cancer.
Thus, FDA did not authorize the use of a health claim on the association between ingestion of dietary fiber, or specific
fiber components, and a reduced risk of heart disease or cancer. Instead, for cancer, FDA, to be consistent with the
available scientific evidence and prevailing scientific agreement, focused on fiber-containing grain products,
fruits, and vegetables as product classes. Similarly, for heart disease, FDA focused on fruits, vegetables, and
grain products that contain fiber, particularly soluble fiber. Because of the usefulness of dietary fiber or soluble
fiber in identifying the types of foods whose consumption is most likely to correlate with decreased cancer or heart
disease risk, these substances can serve as identifying markers for selecting useful foods, even in the absence of
adequate evidence of a direct effect of fiber.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is aware, however, of the rapidly evolving nature of the science base relative to these topic areas. FDA intends
to update its review of the science by initiating, in the near future, along with other major research and health organizations
as cosponsors, a public symposium on dietary fiber and heart disease and cancer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to assertions concerning folic acid, FDA disagrees that it should have allowed health claims on dietary
supplements while prohibiting their use on foods in conventional food form. While FDA did not authorize a health claim
for folic acid and NTD's, in the final rule on heath claims and label statements for folic acid and NTD's published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2606) (hereinafter referred to as ``the folic acid final rule''), the agency did announce
its plans to work expeditiously to authorize a claim, if appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency noted that the Public Health Service (PHS), including FDA, had recommended (Ref. 7) that all women of childbearing
age in the United States should consume 0.4 milligram (mg) (400 micrograms (&mu;g)) of folic acid daily to reduce their
risk of having a pregnancy affected with spina bifida or other neural tube defects. FDA acknowledges that this recommendation
evidenced that significant scientific agreement existed regarding a relationship between folate and NTD's but
said that there were factors that prevented FDA from authorizing a claim. The agency said that the act must be read as
a whole, and that sections 403(r)(3)(A)(ii) and 409 of the act (21 U.S.C. 348) reflect the proposition that the use
of a substance that is the subject of a health claim must be safe. The agency pointed out that the PHS recommendation
stated that there were significant questions that persist about the safe use of folic acid in food. As stated in the
folic acid final rule, FDA expected that the authorization of a claim would likely result in significant increases
in consumption of folic acid by women in their childbearing years and by the general population, because manufacturers
would add folic acid to their products in order to claim that these products were useful in reducing the risk of birth
defects. Intakes of multiple doses of folic acid from supplements and from its increased presence in the food supply
could rapidly result in intakes of 3 to 7 mg (3,000 to 7,000 &mu;g) per day (58 FR 2606 at 2614). Such intakes represent
increases of 10&hyph;fold or more above current intakes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the folic acid final rule, the agency reviewed the safety considerations raised by such increases in folic acid
intakes, including: (1) Potential effects in persons with poor vitamin B12 status; (2) potential risks for persons
taking medications that interfere with folate metabolism; (3) potential risks for pregnant women because of uncertainties
about effects of high blood levels of folic acid on the embryo during gestation; and (4) uncertainties regarding possible
interactions between folic acid and other nutrients with increased folic acid intakes. The agency concluded that
it could not authorize a health claim on folic acid until the questions regarding the safe use of this nutrient were
satisfactorily resolved. In the folic acid final rule the agency described the efforts it was undertaking to address
and resolve these concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following publication of this document, based on its review of the evidence, its discussions with an advisory committee,
and its review of the comments that it received, the agency tentatively concluded that the safety problems raised
by folic acid can be resolved by setting a safe upper limit of intake of 1 mg folate per day for all population groups.
The agency announced its tentative conclusion in a proposal to authorize a health claim on folate and neural tube defects
(58 FR 53254, October 14, 1993). In companion documents, FDA also proposed to amend the food additive regulation for
folic acid to specify the foods that could be fortified with folic acid and the level at which they could be fortified
(58 FR 53312) and to amend the standards of identity for specific cereal-grain products to permit the addition of folic
acid (58 FR 53305).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, based on this review of the agency's actions, it is clear that the nondiscriminatory provision suggested in
the comments is not necessary. When FDA has concluded that a substance has a relationship to a disease, FDA has acted
to authorize a claim (see final rule on calcium and osteoporosis (58 FR 2665) and the proposed rule on folic acid and
neural tube defects (58 FR 53254)). In the case of antioxidant vitamins and cancer, dietary fiber and heart disease,
and dietary fiber and cancer, the evidence did not establish that the named substances had an effect on the named diseases.
The evidence showed that these nutrients were merely markers of foods that had been shown in studies to affect the risk
of the disease. FDA has reflected the scientific evidence in the claims that it has authorized and proposed to authorize.
Any other course of action would be inconsistent with the act because it would result in claims that were both not scientifically
valid and misleading.

B. Alternative Approaches
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33703), FDA advised that a variety of approaches had
come to FDA's attention about how health claims for dietary supplements would best be regulated under the 1990 amendments.
These approaches came to the agency's attention by various means, including the comments on the health claims proposal
that addressed the most appropriate method for regulating dietary supplements, testimony before Congress about
implementation of the 1990 amendments, as well as the legislative history of the 1990 amendments. FDA carefully evaluated
each of these approaches to determine how they compare with the characteristics that FDA has listed above. A number
of comments addressed the agency's tentative conclusions about these approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Use of Advisory Committees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the dietary supplement health claims proposal (see section II.B.1., 58 FR 33700 at 33704), FDA advised that it had
tentatively decided not to adopt a committee-based approach suggested in comments for evaluating the validity of
health claims on herbs. This approach, known as the Botanical Ingredient Review (BIR), would involve the establishment
of expert panels under the direction of an oversight committee. FDA would participate as a nonvoting member of the
expert panels. The oversight committee, which would be charged with the responsibility of reviewing all health claim
petitions pertaining to herb or botanical components, would relieve FDA of all responsibility for initial review
of these petitions. Each expert panel would conduct an evaluation of scientific data pertaining to the requested
claim, subject the evaluation to peer review, and prepare a final recommendation about the claim. The recommendation
and all supporting documents would then be forwarded to FDA, and the agency would be permitted 120 days to approve,
disapprove, or modify the report. Under draft regulations prepared and submitted for FDA adoption by one comment
on the health claims proposal, there would be a codified presumption in favor of the committee recommendation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency based its tentative decision about the BIR on its belief that the suggested approach would involve a significant
transfer of agency authority on health claims because of this presumption in the draft regulations submitted by the
comment. Under this presumption, FDA would be obligated to prove that the committee was wrong if the agency decided
not to follow the committee's recommendation. In such circumstances, FDA could be forced to propose to authorize
health claims that it was not satisfied were scientifically valid. FDA noted that there is no basis under the act for
such a transfer. Also, the agency noted that the creation of such a committee would be financially burdensome and stated
that it would be inappropriate to commit its limited resources to a committee with as narrow a scope as that suggested
by the comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A few comments addressed this advisory committee issue. Some comments voiced opposition to FDA's tentative decision
not to establish a BIR. These comments disputed the agency's assertion that the establishment of a BIR would involve
any transfer of authority, noting that FDA would retain full and final discretion in approving health claims. The
comments also disputed FDA's finding that the creation of a BIR would be burdensome and costly in light of the agency's
limited resources. The comments stated that such a finding is inconsistent with FDA's current use of advisory committees
for very narrow subject matters such as over-the-counter (OTC) antiplaque products, circulatory system medical
devices, and drug abuse. The comments stated that the use of a BIR to help screen petitions from the much larger herbal
products industry would be an efficient, economical, and scientifically credible way to ration FDA's scarce resources
and would also help FDA meet statutorily-imposed deadlines for actions on petitions that it might not otherwise be
able to meet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments also asserted that the agency's statement that it has the ``ultimate responsibility to determine whether
the petitioned-for health claim is valid'' implies a mistrust of the integrity of the BIR process and the involved
scientists and reveals an agency belief that it is the only authority competent to judge the scientific validity of
health claims for herbal dietary supplements. The comments disagreed with such a conclusion and argued that health
claim petitions will only receive adequate and full consideration from the scientific community best qualified
to determine whether they meet the significant scientific agreement standard set by Congress through the creation
of a BIR, which would represent the most competent and knowledgeable body in a field that remains largely esoteric
to FDA. One of these comments suggested that appropriate selections for herbal experts panels might include experienced
herbal practitioners who are familiar with potential adverse reactions to herbs as well as medical practitioners
in foreign countries where herb safety has been studied by government and industry panels. The comment stated that
the inclusion of foreign medical practitioners would be especially appropriate during the evaluation of a claim
whose merits are agreed upon throughout the world but are not generally recognized in the United States, such as in
the case of using peppermint tea for its soothing or carminative effects on the digestive tract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, one comment supported the agency's tentative decision not to adopt the BIR process. The comment stated that
FDA could well be legally liable for decisions made by the BIR that were later shown to have placed the public health
at risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments called for FDA to establish an advisory committee for health claims for dietary supplements where
the committee would select expert panels responsible for the evaluation of proposed health claims for all dietary
supplements. The comments suggested that the expert panels should be composed of scientists and health care professionals
with expertise on a given nutrient-disease relationship as well as nonvoting industry and consumer representatives.
These comments contended that one reason for the agency's slowness in approving a health claim for folic acid has been
its reliance on advisory panels that were not sufficiently familiar with the research in the area and who had to be educated
about the strength of the evidence before they could act. Some of these comments suggested that FDA could retain the
authority to reject the recommendations of the committee, as long as it published its reasons for doing so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment stated that both the dietary supplement industry and FDA have been slow to recognize and utilize a
great deal of research that has been done in the area of nutrition and health. The comment attributed this slowness
to a gap between the scientific community, FDA, and the dietary supplement industry. The comment suggested that in
order to close this gap, FDA should form a committee of its leading scientists to meet with a similar industry committee
every 3 to 6 months, or as required, to discuss the latest research in the area of nutrition and health published in highly
accredited scientific journals so that the research could be used to create and support health claim petitions. The
comment suggested that when the agency committee and the industry reach an agreement on the data, FDA could authorize
the use of a health claim on the nutrient-disease relationship on which there is agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that advisory committees may make valuable contributions in assisting the agency to evaluate scientific
evidence about health claims in certain circumstances. For example, the Folic Acid Subcommittee of the Food Advisory
Committee provided valuable recommendations in support of FDA proposing to authorize a health claim for folic acid
and proposing to fortify cereal-grain products. The agency intends to continue its use of advisory committees wherever
the need arises. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes, however, that it should retain the right to decide when the use of an advisory committee is necessary.
There may frequently be circumstances in which evidence establishes that use of advisory committees is not necessary
because the evidence shows that the claim is clearly supported or clearly not supported. In addition, if the agency
were to establish a standing advisory committee for health claims, FDA would want it to have a broader focus than just
dietary supplements. FDA's view is that claims should focus on the substance, and not the food in which it is found,
because the primary issue is whether the substance-disease relationship has been established. Thus, if FDA were
to establish a standing advisory committee, it would be on health claims in general. Although a number of comments
asserted that FDA lacks knowledge of herbal products, the agency believes that its personnel are fully competent
to evaluate properly substantiated petitions concerning health claims in this area. Also, if the agency were to decide
to establish an advisory committee, it would take steps to ensure that the membership of the committee had the necessary
expertise, including pertinent expertise on herbal products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is an implication in some of the comments that the evaluation of the scientific evidence supporting a claim is
somehow different depending on the substance involved. In fact, whether a claim is for a vitamin, mineral, herb, or
other similar nutritional substance, including fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, the skills needed for evaluation
of a claim are basically the same. These skills are found in epidemiologists, nutritionists, biostatisticians,
clinicians, and experts in the disease being addressed, as well as in people aware of how the substance is, or should
be, consumed. Thus, FDA does not agree with the implication in these comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is interested in having communication with the dietary supplement industry. However, the agency does not believe
that it would be appropriate for the communication to take the form of the suggested standing committee to meet with
a similar industry committee every 3 to 6 months. While FDA believes that regular communication with the dietary supplement
industry is likely to be useful, the process by which health claims are authorized must be a more open and public process
than that suggested by the comment. Certainly the 1990 amendments envisioned a public process for claims for substances
in foods in conventional food form, as reflected in section 403(r)(4) of the act. FDA has been presented with no convincing
reason why a similar process should not apply to claims for substances in dietary supplements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, FDA continues to believe that the BIR advisory committee approach would involve a significant transfer
of agency authority for health claims, even though comments on the health claims proposal and the dietary supplement
health claims proposal have made arguments to the contrary. The suggested regulation for health claims that was submitted
to FDA on May 10, 1991, and referred to by the agency in the proposals that it has issued, states in part:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. If the Committee determines that a proposed health claim is appropriate for a particular herb or botanical, either
as proposed or as modified by the Committee, it shall forward its recommendation(s) to FDA together with all the data
and other information before the Committee when it made its decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. If the Committee determines that, on the basis of the data, and other information before it, the proposed health
claim is not scientifically justified for the herb or botanical, it shall so notify the proposer. The proposer may
then direct the Committee to forward to FDA all the information before the Committee with respect to the proposal together
with its conclusions and the reasons therefore.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Within 120 days of receipt of the information described in (B) and (C) above, FDA shall either accept the recommendation,
reject it, or modify it based upon the Agency's independent evaluation with analysis and reasons for rejection or
modification of recommended health claims. In arriving at its decision FDA may consider data or information other
than that before the Committee. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
There shall be a presumption, to be sustained when the record is viewed as a whole, in favor of a Committee recommendation
under either (B) or (C).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Emphasis added.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite assertions to the contrary, the last sentence of paragraph ``D'' obligates FDA to establish that the committee
was wrong in order not to follow the committee's recommendation. Ultimately, therefore, there would, in fact, be
a significant transfer of authority if the suggested provision were to be adopted by FDA. As FDA noted in the dietary
supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33704), there is no basis under the act for such a transfer of authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not question that experts on an industry committee or panel on herbs and botanicals could be helpful. The agency
encourages firms to work through such groups. For this reason, FDA revised the provision pertaining to petitions
in the health claims final rule to clarify that the agency will consider all recommendations by such committees and
panels (see &sect;101.70(b)). FDA recognizes that those petitions that have undergone an independent scientific
review and received endorsement by qualified expert groups will likely be well-supported petitions and could be
very persuasive to FDA. Further, FDA is likely to place considerable weight on the recommendations of outside experts,
and its decision as to whether a petition should be granted could be influenced significantly by these experts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although FDA encourages firms to work through groups of outside experts, the agency would be concerned if such groups
were heavily weighted with medical practitioners as one of the comments suggested. Over reliance on such practitioners,
to the exclusion of scientists representing other relevant scientific descriptives, implies that the herbs are
to be used for medicinal purposes. FDA stresses again that health claims are about the relationship of foods, rather
than drugs, to a disease or health-related condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Establishment of an Approach Based on a More Lenient or the Same Standard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA proposed to subject dietary supplements to the same scientific standard and procedure that the statute provides
for foods in conventional food form (section 403(r)(3)(B)(i) of the act). The standard, codified in &sect;101.14(c),
states:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) Validity requirement. FDA will promulgate regulations authorizing a health claim only when it determines, based
on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted
in a manner which is consistent with generally recognized scientific procedures and principles), that there is significant
scientific agreement, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that
the claim is supported by such evidence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA explained in the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33705) that it knows of no standard and
procedure for dietary supplements that would both be more lenient than the standard and procedure for foods in conventional
food form and yet still have the characteristics that FDA considers necessary under the 1990 amendments and their
legislative history. The agency stated that it had tentatively concluded that a standard for health claims for dietary
supplements that is based only on section 403(a)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C 343(a)(1)), or that allows health claims based
on the existence of substantial scientific evidence, even though significant scientific agreement about the validity
of the claim does not exist, would be inconsistent with Congress's desire to ensure that health claims that are made
on food, including dietary supplements, are scientifically valid. FDA said that it was concerned that if it were to
allow claims in the marketplace whose validity had not been established, these claims would undercut the credibility
of those health claims that are in fact valid. The agency said that if it were to allow such claims, consumers would be
left little better off, and no less confused, than they were in 1989, before the passage of the 1990 amendments. FDA
also expressed its tentative view that the proposed approach strikes the appropriate balance between the congressional
concern for consumer fraud, public health, and sound science, on the one hand, and the desire to provide the consumer
with information on the other (58 FR 33700 at 33706). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. A large number of comments asserted that FDA should establish an approach based on a more lenient standard for dietary
supplements. Some of these comments argued that such an approach is directed by Congress and cited a statement of Senator
Hatch, one of the primary authors of the 1990 amendments, that ``a more lenient standard for dietary supplement[s]
is envisioned.'' One comment argued that by providing for the establishment of a separate standard for dietary supplements,
Congress had implicitly rejected the rigid standard of ``significant scientific agreement'' adopted for foods
in conventional food form. The comment asserted that FDA was therefore bound by basic tenets of statutory construction
to adopt a more lenient standard for dietary supplements, as such an action would give meaning to Congress's instructions,
whereas the adoption of the proposed standard would in effect render those instructions meaningless. The comment
noted that courts have traditionally not interpreted provisions of a statute in ways that would render other provisions
superfluous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments stated that using the same standard and procedure for dietary supplements as for foods in conventional
food form is counter to the intent of the 1990 amendments because Congress intended to make more, rather than less,
information about the health benefits of dietary supplements available to consumers. The comments asserted that
health information about the effects of diet on disease is particularly important to consumers of dietary supplements
in deciding which products to buy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments argued that restricting this information on dietary supplements will deny millions of Americans
the information that they need to improve their health and to help reduce their risk of deadly afflictions such as heart
disease and cancer. The comments asserted that such restriction will cost the nation millions of dollars in health
care expenditures that could have been saved through disease prevention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments expressed concern that restricting the use of properly qualified health claims based on preliminary
evidence would encourage information-hungry consumers to seek information about the health benefits of various
dietary supplements from sources such as books and the media, which may be unreliable and which are not regulated by
FDA. These comments argued that adopting a policy that results in consumers turning to information that may well be
misleading or outright false is contrary to the educational goals of the 1990 amendments. One comment stressed that
FDA should assist consumers by encouraging them to reduce their risk of disease by changing their diets, lifestyle,
and other factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments suggested that FDA should place more weight on the potential benefits of the health information than on eliminating
all possibility for consumer misunderstanding or all elements of risk associated with increased consumption of
dietary supplements. A few of these comments advised that a more lenient standard would be appropriate for dietary
supplements because they are being sold to educated consumers rather than to the general population. Some of these
comments disputed the argument that consumers could be misled by a more lenient standard. These comments noted that
consumers continue to rely on health messages on products such as cigarettes and condoms, despite the fact that the
messages have changed over the years in response to new scientific findings. Other comments stated that studies have
indicated that consumers are able to use various advertising claims about diet and disease in a rational and beneficial
manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments asserted that FDA should allow the use of preliminary health claims on dietary supplements and foods
in conventional food form because it allows their use on drugs. The comments stated that FDA's proposed revision of
the``Pediatric Use'' subsection of prescription drug labeling in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 16, 1992 (57 FR 47423) would allow prescription drugs that had not been tested for safety and efficacy in
children to nevertheless be given to children provided that the drugs' efficacy claims were qualified by the statement,
``Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established.'' The comments stated that because these drugs
had not been tested for safety and efficacy in children, their claims would be ``preliminary'' at best and misbranding
at worst. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, many comments argued against a more lenient standard and procedure for dietary supplements. Several comments
stressed that the adoption of the proposed standard and procedure is supported by the legislative histories of the
1990 amendments and the DS act. One of these comments maintained that while the 1990 amendments give FDA the option
of adopting a more lenient standard for dietary supplements, the Congressional Record denotes a majority opinion
in favor of FDA applying the same standard to supplements that the act provides for conventional foods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments also warned FDA that holding dietary supplements and foods in conventional food form to different
standards for health claims would lead to consumer confusion, as the health benefits of nutrients derived from dietary
supplements would be allowed to be characterized as superior to the benefits of those same nutrients derived from
foods in conventional food form. Some comments asserted that the creation of public confusion would directly undermine
the intent of the 1990 amendments to clear up consumer confusion about health claim information and would jeopardize
consumer confidence in existing health claims, food labels, and the government, particularly public health officials.
Another comment asserted that adopting a more lenient standard for dietary supplements could also allow some supplement
manufacturers to make unsubstantiated claims and undercut consumer belief in the credibility of the entire supplement
industry. These comments asserted that a single universal standard would best prevent consumer confusion by ensuring
that health claim information is uniform on all foods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments supported the same standard and procedure on the grounds that it would ensure that health claims
appearing on the labels of dietary supplements are based on reliable, peer-reviewed, reproducible evidence. A number
of these comments stated that because supplements, unlike conventional foods, are taken specifically for the health
benefits associated with them, it is especially important that health claims on these products be reliable because
more and more consumers are using these products in the belief that the products will protect their health. The comments
said that these consumers were responding to the large amounts of recent evidence indicating that vitamins, minerals,
and other nutrients may play a role in reducing the risk of chronic diseases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments cautioned FDA that the failure to ensure that health claims on dietary supplements are reliable would
leave consumers open to fraud. A few of these comments pointed out that many consumers do not have the scientific knowledge
to judge the veracity of label claims for themselves and presume that FDA regulations ensure that label claims are
properly substantiated. One of these comments warned that older Americans are especially vulnerable to fraud. This
comment pointed out that the elderly suffer disproportionally from diet-related diseases, read supplement labels
more often than other people, are more trusting of salespersons, and do less research than younger consumers. Other
comments warned that unsubstantiated health claims can harm consumers by inducing them to consume products that
are inherently unsafe, to consume excessive doses of some substances, or to forego more beneficial forms of treatment
for a given malady.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments insisted that the proposed regulations will not restrict the flow of information on nutrition
and health to consumers. One of these comments stated that roughly 80 percent of supplement labels are already in compliance
with the proposed regulations. Other comments noted that educational materials are not covered by the proposed regulations,
and that there are many available channels through which information can be freely disseminated other than food labeling.
Moreover, one comment contended that supplement labels are neither intended, nor currently used, to educate the
public but instead serve to sell the product to which they are attached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments stated that applying the same standard to both conventional foods and dietary supplements would create
a desirable ``level playing field'' for all food processors and manufacturers. One comment stated the adoption of
the proposed standard will provide an atmosphere in which all food manufacturers can move toward the production of
healthier foods, which will benefit the public health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FDA's reconsideration of how best to regulate dietary supplements, one of the most significant issues has been
the issue of whether supplements should be regulated under a more lenient standard or the same scientific standard
as that established by Congress for food in conventional food form. Despite assertions by some that Congress directed
that a more lenient standard be established, the legislative history of the 1990 amendments does not support such
a position. To the contrary, as other comments point out, and as the agency explained in the preambles of the health
claims proposal (56 FR 60537 at 60539 through 60540), the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2507 through 2509),
and the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33703), Congress did not intend that the agency be
forced to adopt a different standard for dietary supplements. Instead, Congress gave the agency the discretion to
adopt any appropriate scientific standard and procedure for dietary supplements. There was nothing in the comments
that indicated that FDA does not have this discretion. Indeed, as some of the comments pointed out, there was considerable
support in both the House of Representatives and the Senate for adoption of the same scientific standard and procedure
for dietary supplements. FDA addressed the position of members of Congress on this issue in the preamble of the dietary
supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33703):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Senator Hatch left no question about his position that FDA should use this flexibility [to adopt the standard and procedure
for dietary supplements that appears appropriate to the agency] to adopt a more lenient standard * * * 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, other members of Congress were equally clear about their position that FDA should not adopt a more lenient
standard. In the October 24, 1990 Congressional Record at S 16608 [Ref. 4], Senator Metzenbaum, the other primary
author of the Senate amendments, stated: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 -->
* * * It is my view that there is no reason to do anything other than utilize the same procedure and standard for dietary
supplements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whatever approach the Secretary takes, he must establish a system that evaluates the validity of health claims for
dietary supplements. The system must be based on the same considerations that guide other agency decisions: public
health, sound scientific principles and consumer fraud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, the House of Representatives clearly did not support a more lenient standard for dietary supplements. The
statement of House Floor Managers that appears in the October, 26, 1990 Congressional Record at H 12953 [Ref. 2] states:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 -->
* * * Whatever approach the agency takes, it must adopt a system that evaluates the validity of any disease claims made
with respect to these substances. Its system must be based on considerations of public health and consumer fraud.
As in every similar decision made by the agency today, we fully expect that the agency's evaluation of disease claims
made with respect to vitamins will be based on sound scientific principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a great potential for defrauding consumers if food is sold that contains inaccurate or unsupportable health
claims. The potential is just as great for vitamins as it is for other products. In our view, vitamins and other substances
covered by this provision should be subject to at least as strong a standard as is applicable to other foods that contain
claims that the food will treat a disease or health condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Nothing in the DS act or its legislative history indicates in any way that Congress changed its position about its goals
of the 1990 amendments with respect to prohibiting misleading health claims and improvement of the public health
through use of valid and understandable claims in food labeling [Ref. 3].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although Congress left no question that the exact standard and procedure for the regulation of health claims for dietary
supplements is left to the discretion of FDA, and although Congress did not provide direct guidance concerning how
FDA should use this discretion, Congress did provide considerable general guidance about the intent of the health
claims provisions of the 1990 amendments. In view of the fact that this guidance does not distinguish between dietary
supplements and foods in conventional food form, FDA considers this guidance to be applicable to both types of foods.
As pointed out above in this response, Senator Metzenbaum, the other primary author of the Senate amendments, stated
that whatever approach the Secretary takes, he must establish a system that evaluates the validity of health claims
for dietary supplements. He stressed that the system must be based on the same considerations that guide other agency
decisions: Public health, sound scientific principles, and consumer fraud (Ref. 4). The quoted statements of the
House Floor Managers also stress that the agency's approach to regulating dietary supplements must be based on considerations
of public health, sound scientific principles, and consumer fraud (Ref. 2). In addition, these quoted statements
make it clear that Congress considered the use of ``inaccurate or unsupportable health claims'' on food labeling
to be harmful to the public (Ref. 2). Moreover, Mr. Waxman, one of the House Floor Managers stated the following in the
July 30, 1990 Congressional Record (H5844):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
What we have sought to do is to permit health claims but only health claims based on scientifically valid information,
and we hope by having that scientifically valid information upon which a claim can be made, that health claims in the
future will be healthful and not misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Furthermore, as the agency pointed out in the January 6, 1993 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 2478 at 2526): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
By enacting the 1990 amendments, Congress sought to ensure that health claims would be scientifically valid and not
misleading. (See, for example, statement of Rep. Madigan, and statement of Rep. Waxman, [Ref. 2]). Experience had
shown that many ``unfounded'' health claims were being used on foods (statement of Rep. Waxman [Ref. 2]). Congress
recognized the ``great potential for defrauding consumers if food is sold that contains inaccurate or unsupportable
health claims.'' Id. (statement of House floor managers). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the high potential for health claims to be misleading, Congress legislated that any claim that is not
consistent with FDA regulations will misbrand a food. Section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act states that a food is misbranded
if its label or labeling contains a claim that ``expressly or by implication * * * characterizes the relationship of
any nutrient * * * of the food to a disease or a health-related condition unless the claim complies with regulations
promulgated by FDA. &sect;403(r)(1)(B)'' (emphasis added). By taking this approach, Congress chose to permit only
those health claims on food that FDA determines to be scientifically valid, effectively recognizing that health
claims are so potentially misleading as to be inherently misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applying the same standard and procedure to health claims on dietary supplements as that that applies to foods in conventional
food form will not affect the availability of any dietary supplements, will ensure that health claims that appear
in labeling are scientifically valid and understandable, and will subject all segments of the food industry to regulation
in a fair and consistent manner. Those comments favoring the same standard and procedure, for reasons of fairness,
control of consumer fraud, and conveyance of valid information about diet and its impact on a disease or health-related
condition, serve to reinforce FDA's conclusion that the agency's proposed rule should be finalized as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency disagrees with arguments that use of the same approach for dietary supplements as for conventional foods
would deny millions of Americans the dietary information that they need to improve their health and thereby cost the
nation millions of dollars in health care expenditures that could have been avoided. As FDA explained in the preamble
of the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33705):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
* * * In the absence of adequate data to establish that health claims are valid, assertions about costs associated with
the lack of information in food labeling and about the benefits of consumption of substances in dietary supplements
are highly speculative and highly questionable. FDA does not agree that it should place more weight on the potential
benefits of the health information than on eliminating the possibility of consumer misunderstanding. FDA must weigh
the public health impact of permitting a multitude of preliminary claims against the possibility that a significant
portion of those claims will be determined to be not scientifically valid. The latter result would likely produce
a perception among many consumers that food labels and health claims, even those that are valid, are not reliable.
To the extent that, as a result, consumers do not change their dietary patterns to reduce their risk of disease, they
will be less healthy, and there will be more needless deaths from disease and more costs to the national economy, rather
than less. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When FDA made this statement, the phrase ``adequate data to establish that health claims are valid'' was intended
to express the position that until the validity requirements of &sect;101.14(c) are met, cost assertions about the
benefits of substance consumption are highly speculative and highly questionable. In general, prior to fulfillment
of this requirement, there may often be studies with a wide variety of strengths and weaknesses indicating that there
may, or may not, be a valid association between a substance and a disease or health-related condition. In deciding
whether or not to authorize a claim, FDA must consider that, while benefits may accrue from the availability of the
claim, there is a very real possibility that significant costs may accrue if the claim is authorized prematurely.
A few studies may often be found about a multitude of associations, and many, if not most, of those associations will
ultimately be found not to be valid. If FDA were to permit preliminary claims about such a multitude of associations,
the agency believes that ultimately what would be lost is the confidence of most consumers in the validity of all claims
that appear in food labeling. FDA believes that the costs to consumers of such a situation would prove to be greater
than the costs of not permitting preliminary claims. Of greater significance, however, is that needless deaths would
ultimately occur where consumers would not change their dietary patterns to adopt a more healthful diet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that Congress, in its enactment of the scientific standard in section 403(r)(3)(B)(i) of the
act, struck what it believed to be an appropriate balance between the costs and benefits of claims on foods in general.
FDA is not aware of any reason to strike a different balance for dietary supplements. FDA would like to assure all affected
parties that the agency will move as expeditiously as possible to permit health claims once the scientific evidence
is sufficiently supportive to conclude that associations between substances and disease or health-related conditions
are valid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although some comments asserted that claims based on a more lenient standard would not be confusing because consumers
of dietary supplements are more knowledgeable than the general population, FDA pointed out in the preamble of the
dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33705) that there is nothing that limits the purchasers
of dietary supplements to ``knowledgeable consumers.'' The comments did not submit justification for FDA to change
its position in this regard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assertions that use of the same scientific standard for dietary supplements as that established for food in conventional
food form is counter to the 1990 amendments because less information about diet and disease will be available to consumers
are not correct. Under the 1990 amendments, authorized health claims provide considerably more information about
the effects of diet on disease where the effects are recognized as scientifically valid than was the case before the
passage of the 1990 amendments. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1993, FDA authorized claims with respect to 7 relationships (see 58 FR 2537, 2552, 2622, 2665, 2739, 2787,
and 2820). Also, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53254), FDA proposed to permit health claims concerning the relationship between folate
and the risk of neural tube birth defects. Admittedly, other health claims are not permitted to appear on food labels
and labeling, but Congress clearly intended through enactment of section 403(r) of the act that only valid health
claims be permitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to concerns that consumers will be forced to seek information about diet and health from

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
unregulated sources such as books and the media, if FDA does not authorize preliminary claims, FDA advises that it
must implement the provisions of the amendments as Congress chose to enact them. The 1990 amendments focus only on
food labels and labeling. FDA cannot ignore its clear responsibilities under the 1990 amendments because of concerns
about the unregulated sources of information that were mentioned in the comments. Moreover, while such sources of
information may lead consumers to seek out products containing particular substances, FDA's action will ensure
that the labels and labeling of those products contain only scientifically valid information that can dispel any
misconceptions created by the unregulated sources. With respect to other concerns expressed by these comments,
the agency believes that the specific required elements in the health claims that it has authorized to date demonstrate
that the agency is encouraging consumers to reduce their risk of disease by changing their diets and lifestyle. For
example, the specific requirements in &sect;101.72(c)(2)(A) requires, in part, that a claim about calcium and osteoporosis
make clear that an adequate level of exercise and a healthful diet are needed in addition to adequate calcium consumption.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Arguments that the agency should allow preliminary claims because of FDA's implementation of the drug provisions
of the act have no merit. Assertions about FDA's proposed action pertaining to ``Pediatric Use'' for drug labeling
in (57 FR 47423) are clearly wrong. The agency's proposed action with respect to requiring the statement ``Safety
and effectiveness in children have not been established'' pertains only to drugs for which there is no agency approval
for any pediatric population to use the drug. In point of fact, the agency proposed to require this statement as a further
warning that the product should not be used for pediatric populations. Thus, this action provides no support for authorizing
preliminary health claims. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As FDA pointed out in the preamble of the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33706), making dietary
supplements subject to the same scientific standard and procedure as for conventional foods does not render section
403(r)(5)(D) of the act superfluous. This section requires that the agency consider what procedure and standard
respecting the validity of claims are most appropriate. This is what the agency has done. The fact that the agency has
found that, on balance, the standard and procedure established for foods in conventional food form are also the most
appropriate for dietary supplements does not render the agency's efforts invalid or the underlying provision superfluous.
The agency was charged with exercising its expertise and discretion, and that is what it has done.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A number of comments provided specific suggestions about the way in which a more lenient approach could be implemented.
Some comments argued that the approach should be sufficiently lenient to permit marketing of dietary supplements
without any restrictions. Some of these comments argued that dietary supplements needed no stringent requirements
because dietary supplements could be adequately regulated under the requirement in section 403(a)(1) of the act
that the labeling of a food must be truthful and not misleading. Other comments suggested that FDA could require a warning
informing the consumer that FDA had not substantiated particular claims appearing on a product. One comment suggested
that substantiated claims could be allowed to appear within a specific advisory panel of the label, while preliminary
claims would be allowed to appear only outside the panel. Another comment suggested that FDA adopt a split label approach,
in which preliminary health claims would be allowed, but the agency would have the right to comment upon them on the
label. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested that health claims for which there is substantial scientific evidence but not yet significant
scientific agreement be subject to a certification and notification procedure rather than rulemaking proceedings.
Under the procedure suggested by the comment, claims could be made for dietary supplements so long as: (1) The claim
expressly discloses the absence of scientific agreement as to the relationship, (2) the manufacturer provides FDA
with a fully documented certification by a panel of at least three qualified experts that there is substantial scientific
evidence supporting the claim, and (3) FDA does not disapprove the claim within 90 days of receipt of the certification.
(When additional information is needed, the 90 day period could be extended an additional 45 days.) Under this suggested
alternative, FDA would have an opportunity to participate in the selection of the expert panel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested that FDA only disallow the use of those health claims on dietary supplements that are not supported
by any evidence, and that it classify all other health claims into one of five categories and allow for their use on products
in conjunction with a code system indicating to consumers the level of substantiation that the claim has achieved.
The comment suggested that the highest category be full substantiation; the second, those claims that have a high
degree of substantiation as judged by non-FDA experts, but that FDA finds to be not fully substantiated; the third,
claims that have support in the form of double-blind placebo controlled studies published in peer-reviewed professional
journals; the fourth, claims that are supported by some evidence from in vitro studies, animal studies, or other studies
that do not involve humans; and the fifth, those claims supported by anecdotal evidence. In support of its call for
various approval levels, the comment stated that simply categorizing a claim as ``substantiated'' or ``unsubstantiated''
does not accommodate the reality that full substantiation of a health claim consists of cumulative evidence from
many studies. The comment maintained that if FDA were to place all claims that have not achieved full substantiation
into the same category, FDA would not be providing a means for the public to distinguish claims that are nearly substantiated
from those that are entirely false. Moreover, the comment stated that an agency determination that a claim is or is
not supported by ``significant scientific agreement'' often reflects a political decision rather than a scientific
one. The comments said that FDA panels comprise a very small percentage of the scientific community, that other scientists
often disagree with the panels' findings, and that there even may be differing opinions within the panels themselves.
The comment stated that, given these conditions, it is blatantly dishonest and misleading to the public for FDA to
make a general declaration that a claim is or is not substantiated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few similar comments called for FDA to devise a multilevel approval scheme for health claims on dietary supplements
that would allow statements concerning the traditional use of a product to appear on the label and would permit the
label of a supplement that contained a substance that was the subject of a pending health claim petition to indicate
that the product was under FDA review for a health claim but not to indicate the nature of the claim. The comments stated
that the adoption of this approach would encourage manufacturers of products that qualify only for the ``traditional
uses'' or ``claim pending'' approval categories to gather, perform, and submit research information to FDA in order
to reach higher approval levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested that FDA allow manufacturers to use facsimiles of the FDA seal in conjunction with the various
ratings. The comment asserted that this approach would encourage manufacturers to come into compliance with FDA
regulations quickly, as the seals would become valuable marketing tools for which consumers look when purchasing
supplements, and the lack of a seal would become a marketing disadvantage for a company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has considered these alternative standards and procedures suggested by the comments and finds that none of them
have the characteristics that are necessary to achieve the goal envisioned by Congress in passing the 1990 amendments.
Previously in this preamble the agency concluded that Congress intended that FDA adopt a scientific standard and
a procedure that ensure that health claims that appear in labeling are scientifically valid and understandable.
None of the alternative standards and procedures offered by the comments meets this objective. One of Congress' primary
concerns in passing the 1990 amendments was the widespread use of health claims whose scientific validity had not
been established (Ref. 1). The purpose of the 1990 amendments was to bring that situation under control. The problem
with the alternative procedures offered by the comments is that, rather than bringing the use of claims on dietary
supplements under control, they would ratify the state of affairs that caused Congress to act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As FDA explained in the preamble of the dietary supplement health claims proposal, a standard for health claims for
dietary supplements that is based only on section 403(a)(1) of the act, or that allows health claims based on the traditional
use of the supplement or the existence of substantial scientific evidence but not significant scientific agreement
about the validity of the claim, would be inconsistent with Congress's desire to ensure that health claims that are
made on dietary supplements, or on any other food, are scientifically valid. FDA pointed out that if such claims were
to be permitted, consumers would be faced with a multitude of claims, some valid and some not valid. FDA stated that
it would be unlikely that consumers could distinguish between valid and invalid claims. Although comments on the
dietary supplement health claims proposal asserted that consumers would not be confused by a multitude of claims,
the comments did not actually go further in addressing how consumers would react to such a situation in food labeling.
More specifically, the comments did not provide data to resolve the question of whether consumers would be able to
understand gradations of scientific reliability of claims on food labeling, or whether consumers would, in fact,
be left as confused as they were before passage of the 1990 amendments. While a number of comments did assert that some
studies show that consumers are able to use various advertising claims about diet and disease in a rational and beneficial
manner, the studies were not actually submitted. In the absence of the studies, FDA has no basis upon which it can evaluate
the assertions of the relevance of the studies to food labeling. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the agency
considers it more likely that consumers would be considerably confused by a multitude of claims with differing degrees
of reliability. One of the purposes of the 1990 amendments was to end such confusion (see statement of Mr. Waxman, 136
Congressional Record H12953 (Ref. 2)). Therefore, FDA rejects this assertion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approaches such as those involving a ``split label'' or the use of an FDA seal would also not be consistent with the congressional
desire for scientific validity because manufacturers would still be able to market dietary supplements with claims
that were not scientifically valid. Even if FDA seals were being used to distinguish those claims that FDA considered
to be valid, there would be a question as to whether consumers would be able to ascertain which claims were preliminary
and which were not. These approaches would not restrict the number of health claims that were of questionable validity,
about which Congress was specifically concerned (Ref. 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, FDA has concluded that it would not be appropriate to adopt any of the alternative approaches suggested by the
comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Several comments suggested that FDA adopt the reasonable substantiation standard used by the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) (see FTC Policy Statement Regarding Advertising Substantiation Program (49 FR 30999, August 2, 1984)). The
comments asserted that under this policy, FDA could allow manufacturers to make claims provided that the nature of
the scientific finding is accurately represented, the degree of evidence is not misrepresented, and the claim passes
a rough cost/benefit test. The comments argued that this policy would facilitate harmonization with the FTC regulations
governing the use of health claims in food advertising, would allow consumers to have access to truthful, nonmisleading,
and reliable labeling information, and would still allow FDA to take action against those dietary supplements bearing
health claims that are not properly substantiated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arguments that FDA should adopt for dietary supplements FTC's approach for regulating advertising are not consistent
with Congress' expectations for health claims. While the FTC and FDA are working together to achieve as much consistency
in their approaches to health claims as their respective statutes allow, adoption by FDA of the FTC advertising substantiation
approach would not provide FDA the confidence Congress intended concerning the scientific validity of the claims.
Specifically, as explained above, one of Congress' main purposes in passing the 1990 amendments was to ensure that
health claims made in food labeling are scientifically valid. No such assurance of scientific validity is provided
under the standard that FTC must employ. Under that standard, there must be some evidence to support a claim, but it
need not rise to the level of establishing the claim's validity. Thus, the FTC standard is not adequate for health claims.
In this context, it is appropriate to reiterate FDA's response to comments asserting that it was bound to follow cases
involving FTC's regulation of advertising in the preamble of the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2528):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Although cases involving FTC may sometimes be relevant, it is important to note that fundamental differences exist
between the regulatory schemes administered by the two agencies. Congress has long recognized the division of roles
between the two agencies_FTC concentrates on the interests of commerce and economic needs, whereas the objective
of FDA is ``the health of the people.'' FTC regulates unfair competition and trade practices, including food advertising.
(See, for example, 15 U.S.C. sections 45 and 52.) In contrast, FDA is a scientific agency empowered to regulate the
food label, among other things. Under section 403(r)(3)(B)(i) of the act, FDA may permit health claims on foods only
if it has determined that those claims meet the statutory test for scientific validity. The laws under which FTC operates
do not include a comparable statutory standard. Thus, it would not be appropriate for FDA to follow the case law involving
FTC.

III. The Final Regulation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of the foregoing, FDA is subjecting dietary supplements to the same standard and procedure that applies to
food in conventional food form. The agency believes that this approach strikes the appropriate balance between the
congressional concern for consumer fraud, public health, and sound science, on the one hand, and the desire to provide
the consumer with information on the other. Thus, the agency is revising &sect;&sect;101.14 and 101.70 to include
dietary supplements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the health claims proposal, FDA proposed definitions for ``health claim,'' ``substance,'' ``nutritive value,''
and ``dietary supplement'' to serve as tools for clearly establishing the scope of the types of claims that would be
subject to the regulations promulgated under section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act. In addition, the agency proposed a
definition for ``disqualifying nutrient levels'' to establish limits on the levels at which certain nutrients that
are known to increase the risk of a disease or health-related condition could be present in a food, and the food would
still be eligible to bear a health claim (see section 403(r)(3)(A)(ii) of the act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the health claims final rule, the agency adopted definitions for the terms ``health claim,'' ``substance,'' ``nutritive
value,'' and ``disqualifying nutrient levels,'' that it revised in response either to comments or to the DS act (see
&sect;101.14(a)(1), (2), (3), and (5)). Also, FDA adopted a definition for the term ``disease or health-related
condition.'' Although the term is used in the definition of ``health claim,'' and the term serves to identify one of
the basic elements of a health claim, the agency had not proposed a definition for it. The agency added this definition
to clarify the coverage of the health claim provisions (see &sect;101.14(a)(6)). Because of the DS act, the agency
reserved the question as to whether these definitions would apply to dietary supplements. The agency also did not
include a definition of ``dietary supplement'' in the final rule because of the moratorium imposed by the DS act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the dietary supplement health claims proposal, FDA proposed to adopt the same regulatory scheme for health claims
for dietary supplements that it had established for foods in conventional food form. To effect this tentative decision,
the agency proposed to revise the definition of ``substance'' to make clear that it covers both food in conventional
food form and dietary supplements and to establish a definition for ``dietary supplement.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received no comments on the former aspect of the proposal. Therefore, the agency is adopting it as proposed. However,
FDA did receive some comments on its proposed definition of ``dietary supplement.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Dietary Supplement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA proposed the following definition for the term ``dietary supplement'' (proposed &sect;101.14(a)(4)):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Dietary supplement
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a food, not in conventional food form, that supplies a component to supplement the diet by increasing the total
dietary intake of that component.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the past, FDA has taken a position that the term ``dietary supplement'' applied only to supplements composed of
essential nutrients. However, FDA did not propose to limit the definition in &sect;101.14(a) in this way because
section 403(r)(5)(D) of the act includes dietary supplements of herbs, substances that generally contain few essential
nutrients. In addition, the legislative history indicates that the term ``other nutritional substances'' could
include a number of substances that have not been shown to be essential or nutrients (Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. One comment commended the agency for proposing a definition of ``dietary supplement'' that recognized that these
foods could have components other than substances known to be essential nutrients. The comment asserted that the
proposed definition would appropriately move supplements out of the food additive category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that the comment's assertion that the definition moves dietary supplements out of the food additive category
is not correct. A dietary supplement, as the definition recognizes, is a compounded food that may include compounds
that are food additives. Whether a component of food is a food additive or not is determined under section 201(s) of
the act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), not section 403(r) of the act. Congress specifically provided in section 9 of the 1990 amendments
that these amendments ``shall not be construed to alter the authority of the Secretary of Health and Human Services
* * * under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.'' Thus, the components of dietary supplements that are food additives
are still fully subject to the food additive requirements under section 409 of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A few comments requested that the proposed definition of ``dietary supplement'' be modified to explicitly include
all herbal extracts. One of these comments asserted that the definition should include ``processed or unprocessed
plant parts (bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, and stems) as well as extracts of essential oils, marketed as teas, powders,
tablets, capsules, and elixirs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is adopting the definition of ``dietary supplement'' as proposed. This definition is intentionally broad to
cover the range of substances that, under the legislative history, could be included in a dietary supplement and could
be the subject of a health claim. The purpose of the definition of ``dietary supplement'' is not to define the substances
that may be eligible to be the subject of a health claim but to define the form in which they are to be sold to be subject
to regulation as a ``dietary supplement.'' Under the scheme that FDA is adopting, and that Congress envisioned (see
Ref. 4, statement of Senator Metzenbaum), the determination as to what substances are appropriately the subject
of a health claim is made on a case-by-case basis, based on the factors set out in &sect;101.14(b) and the evidence presented
to the agency. The agency disagrees with the comment in one respect, however. Teas are food in conventional food form
and thus not included within the definition of ``dietary supplement.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. One comment asserted the definition of ``dietary supplement'' should include foods in conventional food form
that are fortified with a vitamin or mineral to a level of 50 percent or more of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) per serving
(e.g., many breakfast cereals).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not agree that such foods should be included in the definition of ``dietary supplements.'' As discussed in
the preamble to the dietary supplement proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33707), FDA has limited this definition to foods not
in conventional food form to reflect the approach taken by Congress in the DS act. The manager's statements for the
DS act from the Senate and the House (Ref. 3) clearly state that the moratorium on the implementation of the 1990 amendments
applies only to dietary supplements ``not in the form of conventional food.'' Because foods in conventional food
form were not covered by the DS act moratorium, the health claims regulations already apply to them. Consequently,
FDA believes that it will reduce confusion about the impact of these regulations if the agency limits coverage of the
term ``dietary supplements'' to foods not in conventional food form. Of course, foods in conventional food form that
are formulated to supplement the dietary intake of nutrients will be free to reflect their characteristics in their
common or usual name (e.g., vitamin and mineral supplement cereal). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Nutritive Value
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the health claims final rule, FDA defined ``nutritive value'' as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Nutritive value 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 means a value in sustaining human existence by such processes as promoting growth, replacing loss of essential nutrients,
or providing energy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although FDA did not propose any changes in the definition of ``nutritive value'' in the dietary supplement health
claims proposal, many comments expressed concern about the impact of this definition in conjunction with the preliminary
requirement in &sect;101.14(b)(3)(i) that the substance that is the subject of a health claim contribute taste,
aroma, or nutritive value, or any technical effect listed in &sect;170(o), and that the substance must retain that
attribute when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim. (Preliminary requirements are criteria
in &sect;101.14(b) that have to be met before a substance will qualify to be the subject of a health claim. An indepth
discussion of all preliminary requirements follows in section III.B. of this document.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Some comments urged the agency to broaden its definition of ``nutritive value.'' These comments urged the agency
to recognize that the processes by which a nutrient promotes health, maintains proper bodily functioning, and protects
the body from the development of chronic disease or other health-related conditions are, in and of themselves, characteristic
of ``nutritive value.'' The comments noted that the basic function of Vitamin E, for example, relates to its antioxidant
properties in preventing cell damage by trapping peroxyl free radicals and inhibiting the oxidation of unsaturated
fatty acids. Also, the comments pointed out that fiber does not promote growth, replace essential nutrients, or provide
energy, but that Congress specifically required FDA to study the relationship between various diseases and fiber.
Some of the comments asked that the phrase ``preventing or repairing the negative metabolic consequences of life
processes'' be added to the list of processes that characterize the nutritive value of a food to ensure that such components
can be the subject of health claims. A few comments asserted that FDA should revise the definition of ``nutritive value''
to provide for claims about ``prevention'' of a disease or health-related condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, one comment maintained that the definition of ``nutritive value'' in &sect;101.14(a)(3) is broad enough
to include the functions of most dietary supplements. The comment supported its position by agreeing with FDA's statement
in the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2488) that the inclusion of the phrase ``such as'' in the definition ensures
that the three referenced processes are examples of how a substance may confer nutritive value rather than as an all-inclusive
list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment that highlighted FDA's use of the phrase ``such processes as'' in this definition is correct. FDA intended
the three referenced processes to be examples of how a substance may confer nutritive value rather than as an all-inclusive
list of the functions that provide such value. As FDA explained in the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2488),
the definition of ``nutritive value'' is intended to be very flexible. The agency incorporated this flexibility
in the definition because FDA recognizes that certain substances can play a major role in reducing the risk of certain
chronic diseases and may confer their benefits through a number of processes. FDA believes that the agency should
evaluate the nutritive value claimed for a substance that is proposed as the subject of a health claim, as described
in a health claim petition, on a case-by-case basis. This approach will best ensure that the definition retains its
intended flexibility and does not become an unintentional barrier to authorization for legitimate health claims.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does believe, however, that this preamble should provide guidance concerning how the agency will determine if
a claimed nutrient-disease relationship derives from the nutritive value of a substance. In general, the agency
will look for evidence that the claimed effect on disease is associated with the normal maintenance of human existence.
If the substance is used to correct an abnormal physiological function caused by a disease or health-related condition,
the action of the substance is clearly beyond a normal maintenance function, and the health benefit would therefore
not derive from the substance's nutritive value. Such a substance would be a drug. (Note also that claims about classical
nutrient deficiency diseases are not health claims (see 58 FR 2478 at 2481).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that many of the benefits mentioned in the comments may derive from the nutritional value of a substance.
The agency's broad definition of ``nutritive value'' includes assisting in the efficient functioning of classical
nutritional processes and of other metabolic processes necessary for the normal maintenance of human existence.
Dietary fiber, for example, helps to assure normal intestinal transit time, thereby providing nutritional value
by promoting efficient bowel function. Vitamin E provides nutritive value through its antioxidant function of reduction
of cell damage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to assertions that FDA should revise the definition of ``nutritive value'' to provide for claims about
``prevention'' of a disease or health-related condition, the agency points out that the preamble of the health claims
final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2501 through 2502) fully addressed this matter and concluded that a claim that a substance
can be used in the prevention, diagnosis, cure, mitigation, or treatment of a disease or symptom is inappropriate
for a food (see section 201(g)(1)(B) of the act and &sect;101.9(k)(1) (21 U.S.C. 101.9(k)(1))). FDA reached this
conclusion because the relationship of a food or a food component to a disease is quite different from that of a drug.
The comments making these assertions did not provide any basis upon which FDA could conclude that the agency's position
in this matter should be different for dietary supplements than for foods in conventional food form. As FDA explained
in the preamble of the health claims final rule, the Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health (Ref. 5) points
out that, apart from classic disorders resulting from dietary deficiencies of essential nutrients (e.g., pellagra
and niacin), it has proved difficult to demonstrate causal associations between specific dietary factors and chronic
or other diseases (e.g., dietary fiber and cancer). The report states:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Development of the major chronic disease conditions_coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer_is affected
by multiple genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors among which diet is only one_albeit an important_component.
These other factors interact with diet in ways that are not completely understood. In addition, foods themselves
are complex; they may contain some factors that promote disease as well as others that are protective. The relationship
of dietary fat intake to causation of atherosclerotic heart disease is a prominent example. An excess intake of total
fat, if characterized by high saturated fat, is associated with high blood cholesterol levels and therefore an increased
risk for coronary heart disease in many populations. A higher proportion of mono- and polyunsaturated fats in relation
to saturated fats is associated with lower blood cholesterol levels and, therefore, with a reduced risk for coronary
heart disease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of these complexities, definitive scientific proof that specific dietary factors are responsible for specific
chronic disease conditions is difficult_and may not be possible_to obtain, given available technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(Ref. 5).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Several comments argued that the definition of ``nutritive value'' should include levels of nutrients that are
achievable only through the use of fortified foods or dietary supplements. Several of these comments referenced
studies recently reported in the New England Journal of Medicine that indicate that vitamin E reduces the risk of heart
disease when consumed at levels that are almost impossible to achieve through a conventional diet but that can be easily
and safely attained through the use of dietary supplements. These comments asserted that it would be inappropriate
for FDA to categorize the involved nutrient levels of vitamin E as therapeutic and to refuse to consider approving
a health claim simply because the claim concerns levels of a nutrient above that achievable in a normal daily diet.
A few of the comments supported this assertion by noting that the mechanism by which Vitamin E protects against cell
damage when consumed at normal dietary levels is identical to the mechanism by which it protects against heart disease
when consumed at higher levels. The comments maintained that, in cases such as this one, the agency should approve
health claims for use strictly on dietary supplements, provided that the nutrient is safe when consumed at the level
at which the claimed effect is achieved, and the supplement is intended to be consumed to optimize health rather than
as a drug. The comments supported this regulatory approach by noting that the health benefits of calcium occur when
the nutrient is consumed at increased levels that can be achieved through the diet or by supplementation and stating
that vitamin E should not be treated differently simply because the beneficial levels cannot be reached without the
use of dietary supplements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar comments argued that FDA should at least avoid establishing a maximum level of a nutrient that is considered
to be characteristic of ``nutritive value.'' One of these comments noted such an approach results in an extremely
fuzzy line, because the maximum level of a nutrient that is achievable in a diet varies widely from one individual to
another. As an example, the comment pointed out that a person who eats ten oranges or drinks a quart of orange juice per
day gets more vitamin C than is provided by most currently marketed vitamin C supplements. A few comments asserted
that there is much scientific disagreement over what levels of a nutrient are ``nutritive,'' with many scientists
contending that levels much higher than the U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances (U.S. RDA) fall within the definition.
A few comments requested that FDA explicitly express in its regulations a policy that nutritive value may involve
relatively high levels of a nutrient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few comments maintained that FDA should presume that all nutrients function in a nutritive manner regardless of
their level, unless it has proof to the contrary. In support of this position, a number of comments objected to the use
of niacin's effect on blood cholesterol levels in the dietary supplement proposal as an example of an effect that is
not nutritive. One of these comments questioned FDA's assertion that niacin does not exhibit cholesterol-reducing
properties when ingested at the levels conventionally associated with its function as a vitamin. The comment stated
that niacin's vitamin effect occurs below the level of tissue saturation and maintained that the excretion of niacin
when consumed at higher levels known to be associated with cholesterol-lowering effects does not necessarily indicate
that tissue saturation has occurred. This comment also disagreed with the agency's statement that the occurrence
of liver damage when high levels of niacin are consumed indicates that the effect of niacin at these levels is not nutritive
in nature. The comment argued that it is quite possible that niacin continues to have nutritive effects at these levels
but simply is overloading the body's normal metabolic pathways for ridding itself of excessive levels of the nutrient.
The comment asserted that while legitimate safety concerns exist in particular cases of excessive nutrient intake,
FDA should not use this fact to conclude that high levels of those nutrients are inherently nonnutritive in nature
and are instead pharmacological. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments expressed the belief that nothing in the proposed regulations would automatically exclude high levels
of nutrients from the definition of ``nutritive value'' and urged the agency to include such levels in instances where
they would benefit the public health. These comments also agreed with FDA's decision to review on a case-by-case basis
whether the amount of a substance is appropriate as the subject of a health claim. One of these comments stated that
such an approach would help to ensure that health information about fortified foods and dietary supplements can be
conveyed without triggering the drug regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not believe that it is necessary for the rules to explicitly state that nutritive value includes relatively
high levels of a nutrient. As some comments pointed out, the case-by-case approach, which, as stated above, is intrinsically
linked with the preliminary requirement in the provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;101.14(b)(3)(i), provides the agency with considerable flexibility with respect to high levels of substances
in dietary supplements. Under this approach, FDA has not, as a general rule, established any maximum level at which
a nutrient would cease to have ``nutritive value.'' Furthermore, the agency advises that there is no basis for concerns
that FDA would use safety concerns alone to conclude that high levels of nutrients are pharmacological. FDA will not
do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As some of the comments pointed out, petitions for claims that require that high levels of substances be ingested should
have no problem demonstrating that the substance has nutritive value where the mechanism by which the substance affects
the risk of disease at these high levels is the same as the mechanism by which it functions as a nutrient at normal dietary
levels. However, it will still be necessary, as the agency explained in response to the previous comment, for the petition
to show that the substance's effect on disease is associated with the normal functioning of the human body (e.g., the
substance could not be used to correct an abnormal physiological function caused by a disease or health-related condition.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its response to the previous comment, the agency acknowledged that vitamin E provides nutritive value through
its antioxidant function of reduction of cell damage. If there are situations where it can be established that this
same antioxidant mechanism affects the risk of disease when the vitamin is consumed at levels significantly higher
than normal dietary levels, such levels would satisfy the requirement in &sect;101.14(b)(3)(i) that a substance
retain its food attribute (i.e., its nutritive value) when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not agree, however, that it should presume that all nutrients function in a nutritive manner, regardless
of their level, unless it has proof to the contrary. It would not be practicable for the agency to bear the burden of determining
the mechanism by which the claimed effect is occurring for each petitioned claim. Thus, the agency finds that it is
appropriate to require that petitioners provide the basis for why it is reasonable to conclude that the claimed effect
is nutritional and not pharmacological. However, the agency does not necessarily expect absolute proof on this issue.
FDA will evaluate petitions on this issue on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has considered assertions that the dietary supplement proposal should not have cited the cholesterol-reducing
properties of niacin as an example of a high dose effect that is not nutritive. FDA has again concluded that niacin is
an appropriate example because there are significant indications that a nutritive mechanism is not responsible
for the cholesterol-lowering effect that occurs with high levels of niacin intake. When FDA stated in the dietary
supplement proposal that levels of niacin necessary to produce the cholesterol-lowering effect are far in excess
of the levels at which there is tissue saturation for niacin's vitamin function, the agency was attempting to explain
that for niacin's function as a vitamin there is a level beyond which additional niacin will not provide additional
functional results for that vitamin. The term ``tissue saturation'' may imply either this type of situation (sometimes
referred to as ``function saturation'') or the type of situation referred to in one of the comments wherein the tissue
is saturated with a concentration of a substance, and more substance could immediately spill out into the urine. FDA
was not attempting to assert that the tissue itself was actually saturated. There is no question that additional niacin
will be absorbed by cells when the vitamin function saturation level is reached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the situation with vitamin function saturation, there are other indications that the cholesterol-reducing
properties of niacin do not result from the same mechanism as that presented by its vitamin function. Vitamin function
saturation may be achieved through dietary supplementation with either of the two forms of the vitamin, nicotinic
acid or nicotinamide. However, only nicotinic acid provides, at high levels, the cholesterol-reducing effects.
Such effects do not appear with high level consumption of nicotinamide (Ref. 6). If the same mechanism were involved
with the vitamin function of niacin as with the cholesterol-reducing properties of niacin, both forms of this vitamin
should have cholesterol-reducing properties.

3. Health Claim
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the dietary supplement health claim proposal, FDA did not propose to make any modifications in the definition of
``health claim'' in &sect;101.14(a)(1):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Health claim means any claim made on the label or in labeling of a food, including a dietary supplement, that expressly
or by implication, including ``third party'' references, written statements (e.g., a brand name including a term
such as ``heart''), symbols (e.g., a heart symbol), or vignettes, characterizes the relationship of any substance
to a disease or health-related condition. Implied health claims include those statements, symbols, vignettes,
or other forms of communication that suggest, within the context in which they are presented, that a relationship
exists between the presence or level of any substance in the food and a disease or health-related condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, FDA received several comments on this definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. Some comments asserted that FDA should clarify the types of statements that will be regulated as health claims.
A few of these comments asked whether statements that indicate that a product may be useful in maintaining good health
(e.g., ``Substance X may be beneficial to good health'') or that describe the biochemical functions of vitamins,
minerals, and other nutrients (e.g., ``Vitamin A is necessary for good eyesight,'' ``Protein helps build a strong
body'') will be considered to be health claims. The comments objected to FDA's failure to provide clear instruction
in this regard. These comments asserted that the agency's allowance of case-by-case interpretation of the regulations
will hinder industry compliance, create enforcement problems for the agency, and cause continued antagonism between
FDA and the food industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that it provided ample guidance on what types of statements constitute health claims in the health claims
final rule. As the agency explained in the preamble of that rule (58 FR 2478 at 2479 through 2488), the definition establishes
that a claim must have at least two basic elements for it to be regulated as a ``health claim.'' First, the claim must
be about a ``substance'' as defined in &sect;101.14(a)(2). Secondly, the claim must characterize the relationship
of that substance to a ``disease or health-related condition,'' as defined in &sect;101.14(a)(6): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Disease or health-related condition
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 means damage to an organ, part, structure, or system of the body such that it does not function properly (e.g., cardiovascular
disease), or a state of health leading to such dysfunctioning (e.g., hypertension); except that diseases resulting
from essential nutrient deficiencies (e.g., scurvy, pellagra) are not included in this definition (claims pertaining
to such diseases are thereby not subject to 101.14 or 101.70).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a statement has one of these elements without the other, it would not be a ``health claim,'' although it may still
be subject to regulation under other provisions of the act (e.g., the requirement of section 403(a)(1) of the act that
a label statement be truthful and not misleading). Thus, all of the statements mentioned by the comments would not
be health claims because they do not address a disease or health-related condition as defined under &sect;101.14(a)(6).
The agency has provided a lengthy and detailed discussion on what types of statements constitute health claims in
the health claims final rule at the pages cited above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. A few comments asked whether FDA would remove or prohibit the publishing of books containing information on health
claims and argued that such regulations would clearly be unconstitutional. Other comments addressed the issue of
whether FDA's health claims regulations for dietary supplements would apply to advertising. One of these comments
interpreted an excerpt from the report of FDA's Task Force on Dietary Supplements as an attempt to disallow the use
of unapproved health claims in magazines, newsletters, or other media channels unless the information has been preapproved
by FDA. That excerpt reads:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The task force considered various issues in its deliberations, including how to assure the safety of dietary supplements;
how to limit the potential for fraud, i.e., disease claims made on labels or through other means, e.g., magazine articles,
newsletters, and advertisements * * *.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment further asserted that this same intent is reflected in the health claim regulations proposed in November
1991. The comment stated that this broad-based application of the health claims regulations would severely jeopardize
the reporting of health and disease-related information in almost every form of media, would inhibit the evolution
of scientific knowledge, would have a significant negative impact on the public health of America, and was likely
unconstitutional.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that the provisions of this regulation pertain only to a product's label and labeling. This regulation
does nothing to censor the content of books, magazines, or advertising. This regulation also does not in any way regulate
the availability of books, magazines, or advertising. However, firms sometimes choose to use such material as labeling
for their products, and if used as such, the material would be subject to this regulation. For example, sometimes firms
copy an article from a magazine and display that article with a product that is offered for sale. Under such circumstances,
the article would be a part of the labeling of that product. What is significant to note is that these regulations in
no way limit what articles may be published, or what books may be printed. They limit only the claims that may be made
in the labeling of food products. Under the act, advertising may provide objective evidence of what the intended use
of a particular product is. If the advertising reveals that the product is intended to be used as a drug, the product
may be regulated as a drug. In addition, claims made in advertising may affect the type of nutrition labeling that is
provided (see &sect;101.9(j)). Claims made in advertising, however, are not subject to section 403(r)(1)(B) of
the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the agency finds no merit in the concerns expressed by these comments.

B. Preliminary Requirements for a Claim
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the health claims final rule, FDA established several criteria in &sect;101.14(b) that have to be met before a substance
will qualify to be the subject of a health claim. The criteria provide that the substance must: (1) Be associated with
a disease or health-related condition for which the general U.S. population is at risk (alternatively, the relevance
of the claim may be explained within the context of the daily diet) (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;101.14(b)(1)); (2) be a food (see &sect;101.14(b)(2) and (b)(3)(i)); and (3) be safe and lawful under applicable
food safety provisions of the act (see &sect;101.14(b)(3)(ii)). These criteria reflect not only the requirements
of section 403(r) of the act but also the fact that FDA is charged with ensuring that the food supply is safe, and that
the food label is not misleading. Given that agency evaluations of the validity of a health claim will be resource intensive,
FDA decided not to undertake such evaluations unless a petition for a health claim demonstrates that the preliminary
requirements are met. While FDA had proposed in November of 1991 that these preliminary requirements cover substances
in dietary supplements as well as foods in conventional food form, the provisions of the DS act precluded the agency
from applying these preliminary requirements to substances in dietary supplements at the time that the rule was finalized.
Thus, the preliminary requirements established in the health claims final rule apply only to substances in foods
in conventional food form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The dietary supplement health claim proposal contained provisions to subject the components of dietary supplements
to the same preliminary requirements in &sect;101.14(b) that apply to any other substance that is proposed as the
subject of a health claim. This final rule for dietary supplements retains these provisions as proposed. Specific
reference to dietary supplements in &sect;101.14(b)(1) and (b)(2) is not necessary because the requirements in
these paragraphs apply generally to any ``substance,'' and FDA's revision of the definition of ``substance'' in
&sect;101.14(a)(2) includes the components of dietary supplements within the coverage of this term. However, FDA
proposed to add a specific reference to dietary supplements to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of &sect;101.14 to clarify that
the substance may be a component of a food that is in the form of a dietary supplement. The only comments on the issue agreed
with the agency's proposed revision. Accordingly, as proposed, FDA is including in the final regulations a reference
to dietary supplements in the codified language of &sect;101.14(b)(3)(i). Specifically, FDA is inserting the phrase
``regardless of whether the food is in conventional food form or dietary supplement form'' into &sect;101.14(b)(3)(i).

1. Effect on General Population
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. One comment argued that the proposed requirement that a substance be associated with a disease or health-related
condition for which the general U.S. population or a subpopulation thereof is at risk, or that the claim be explained
within the context of the daily diet, would prohibit the appearance of health claims on herbal dietary supplements.
However, the comment did not explain how the requirement would have this effect, and the comment's own analysis of
how garlic would or would not meet various proposed requirements indicated that garlic would meet this particular
requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not agree that this preliminary requirement will present any significant barriers to the appearance of health
claims on dietary supplements. To the contrary, as the agency explained in the preamble of the health claims final
rule (58 FR 2478 at 2499), FDA intends to employ a flexible approach in interpreting this provision. The alternative
aspect of the provision, which creates the possibility of claims about the relationship of a substance to a disease
or health related-condition that affects very few in the U.S. population as long as the petition in support of the claim
addresses that fact and the relevance of the claim in the context of the total daily diet, evidences a determination
by FDA to provide the widest latitude possible for proposed claims to qualify under this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. One comment requested that FDA not limit the diseases or health-related conditions that may be the subject of a
health claim to those for which the entire United States is at potential risk. The comment asserted that health claims
should also be allowed in cases where dietary factors have been conclusively shown to affect diseases or health-related
conditions for which only a particular subportion of the U.S. population is at risk (e.g., ovarian cancer in women).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that the general eligibility provisions of its health claims regulations in &sect;101.14(b)(1) do not
contain the restriction cited by the comment. While these provisions contain a requirement that health claims pertain
to diseases or health-related conditions affecting the general U.S. population, they also provide that health claims
may pertain to diseases or health-related conditions for which an identified subgroup of the U.S. population is at
risk. Thus, ovarian cancer in women would clearly be an appropriate subject of a health claim.

2. Components of Food Within the Context of a Daily Diet
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The preliminary requirement that a substance that is to be the subject of a health claim must be a food appears in &sect;
101.14(b)(2) and (b)(3)(i). If the substance is present at decreased dietary levels, under &sect;101.14(b)(2),
it must be a nutrient that is required to be included in nutrition labeling (e.g., cholesterol, total fat). If the substance
is present at other than decreased dietary levels, under &sect;101.14(b)(3)(i), it: (1) Must contribute taste,
aroma, or nutritive value, or any other technical effect listed in &sect;170.3(o), to the food and (2) must retain
that attribute when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Numerous comments expressed concern about the aspect of the preliminary requirement of &sect;101.14(b)(3)(i)
that requires that a substance contribute taste, aroma, or nutritive value, or any technical effect listed in &sect;170.3(o),
in view of the agency's definition of ``nutritive value'' in &sect;101.14(a)(3). A number of these comments characterized
these provisions as an attack by the agency against dietary supplements. Some comments asserted that the proposed
preliminary requirement would prohibit dietary supplements, especially those containing herbs, from bearing
health claims. Comments pointed out that many herbs, such as garlic, are specially processed to remove the flavor
or odor from the final supplement product. A number of comments explained that such supplements would fail to meet
this requirement because their beneficial effects on the body often are derived from substances unique to the plant
that do not promote growth, replace loss of essential nutrients, or provide energy. A few comments also noted that
many herbs contain insignificant amounts of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments asserted that the adoption of any preliminary requirement that would automatically disqualify herbal
dietary supplements from bearing health claims would undermine the intent of Congress to establish a nondrug review
process for health claims involving herbs. These comments asserted that the 1990 amendments clearly provide that
herbal dietary supplements can be the topic of a health claim. Furthermore, a comment asserted that the Court of Appeals
held in

than taste, aroma, or nutritive value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asserted that all dietary supplements already meet the this preliminary requirement. The comment noted
that a substance to be consumed at other than decreased dietary levels may also be shown to be a food by contributing
any technical effect listed in &sect;170.3(o). The comment stated that &sect;170.3(o)(20) lists one of those technical
effects as nutrient supplementation and broadly defines a ``nutrient supplement'' as ``substances which are necessary
for the body's nutritional and metabolic processes.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not believe that it is overly restrictive to require, as it does in &sect;101.14(b)(3)(i), that a substance
be a food or a component of food for it to be the subject of a health claim. Section 403 of the act, which includes the health
claims provisions, states, ``A food shall be deemed to be misbranded * * *'' (emphasis added). Thus, section 403(r)
of the act describes the circumstances in which a food will, and will not be, misbranded if it bears a health claim. It
is therefore appropriate for the agency to make it incumbent on the proponent of a health claim to demonstrate that
the substance that is to be the subject of the claim is a food or component of food.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, however, a substance whose uses do not include taste, aroma, or nutritive value is not a food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;101.14(b)(3)(i), FDA incorporated this common sense definition of food and the phrase ``or any technical
effect listed in &sect;170.3(o),'' which reflects the fact that the definition of ``food'' in section 201(f)(3)
of the act includes ``articles used for components of food,'' as a preliminary requirement to ensure that a substance
that is to be the subject of a health claim is in fact a food. This preliminary requirement is fundamental because both
the component of a food that is the subject of a health claim and a component of a drug have a characterizable relationship
to a disease. Congress recognized this fact by creating an exception from section 201(g)(1)(B) of the act, in the definition
of ``drug'' for foods that bear a claim authorized under section 403(r) of the act. Thus, it is crucial to the continuing
viability of the act itself that the choice of the test that determines whether a claim that characterizes the relationship
of a substance to a disease can be made be based on the appropriate factors. Under the act, that choice turns in part on
whether the substance is a food. Therefore, FDA has reflected in &sect;101.14(b)(3)(i) the judicially recognized
characteristics of a food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this regard, interested persons should not presume that inclusion of the phrase ``or any technical effect listed
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;170.3(o)'' in &sect;101.14(b)(3)(i) means that substances that may be classified within one or more of the
categories of food additives in &sect;170.3(o) automatically meet this preliminary requirement. The classifications
within &sect;170.3(o) are of a general nature to reflect the uses to which food ingredients are put. All of the classifications
pertain to the effect of the ingredients on food (e.g., by affecting the texture of the food) rather than on the human
body. Only a substance that is used for the technical effect in &sect;170.3(o)(20), that of a nutrient supplement,
has the potential to have a useful effect in the body because of the characteristics that cause it to be used in the food.
The ``nutrient supplement'' category includes ``Substances which are necessary for the body's nutritional and
metabolic processes.'' As the comments themselves recognized, not every component of a dietary supplement has such
an effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the agency's broad, flexible definition of ``nutritive value,'' FDA does not find any merit in arguments
that the provisions requiring that a substance be a food should be removed. To the contrary, FDA believes that these
provisions will benefit the public health by allowing the agency to devote its limited resources for review of petitions
to those that are appropriate for consideration under the health claim provisions of the act. Accordingly, FDA considers
these provisions essential elements under the framework that it has created in its regulations for the regulation
of health claims and fully consistent with the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comments' characterization of its actions as an attack against dietary supplements. FDA believes
that the combined effect of &sect;101.14(b)(3)(i), the preliminary requirement that a substance be a food, and &sect;101.14(a)(3),
the definition of ``nutritive value,'' will not present dietary supplements with any unreasonable barriers for
agency evaluation of potential health claims for components of these products. Without question, these provisions
do restrict health claims to effects on a disease or a health-related condition resulting from the nutritive value
of substances. However, as one comment pointed out, the current definition of ``nutritive value'' in &sect;101.14(a)(3)
is broad enough to include the functions of most dietary supplements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One observation that might bear making in this context is that Congress has given the agency a statutory structure
with which to deal. In relevant part, that structure divides the world of substances that have a relationship to disease
into foods and drugs. Congress placed the health claims provisions on the food side of the ledger. FDA is charged with
implementing those provisions in accordance with the act and applicable legal precedents. FDA has announced its
intention to implement the health claim provisions as flexibly as possible, but at some point the agency simply cannot
be as flexible as some of the comments have suggested. At that point, the agency would start to erode the scheme that
the statute has established for drugs. The agency cannot do that. If Congress intended something that goes beyond
the scheme that FDA has established in these final regulations, then what is required is a change in the law itself.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Many comments objected to the aspect of &sect;101.14(b)(3)(i) that requires that a substance retain its food
status (i.e., its nutritive value) when consumed at levels that are necessary to justify a claim. Almost all concern
was directed toward consumption of substances at levels significantly higher than those present in the daily diet.
Some comments urged FDA to evaluate proposed health claims involving relatively high levels of nutrients on the grounds
that categorically prohibiting them would deny Americans beneficial information rather than educating them on
how to alter their diets to achieve optimal health. Other comments stated that FDA's categorical refusal to evaluate
such health claims because of the nutrient levels involved would directly violate both the Proxmire Amendment and
the congressional intent behind the 1990 amendments. These comments noted that the 1990 amendments provide for the
appearance of health claims on foods and stated that, subject to certain conditions, the Proxmire Amendment's prohibition
against regulating a vitamin supplement as a drug ``solely because it exceeds the level of potency which the Secretary
determines is nutritionally rational or useful'' guarantees the regulation of vitamins as foods regardless of the
levels of nutrients that they supply. The comments also stated that Congress envisioned the approval of such health
claims, as it was aware that dietary supplements substantially in excess of the U.S. RDA's were routinely being consumed
by Americans, and it chose to direct that FDA conduct a review of antioxidant vitamins/cancer claims with dietary
supplements in mind. Other comments further asserted that FDA was attempting to circumvent the Proxmire Amendment
and create maximum potency levels for all supplements by establishing an upper limit for ``nutritive value.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not agree that any conflict with section 411 of the act is presented by a requirement that, to be the subject
of a health claim, the substance must be a food, that is, consumed primarily for its taste, aroma, or nutritive value.
There is nothing in the health claims final rule or in the regulations established by this document that will affect
in any way the availability of dietary supplements or consumers' freedom to choose to purchase them. Rather, the regulations
that FDA is establishing are intended to ensure that any health claims that may be made for dietary supplements are
scientifically valid. This is what section 403(r)(5)(D) of the act directs FDA to do.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in these regulations would necessarily prevent a supplement from bearing a health claim when it contains
a level of a substance that exceeds the level achievable in the context of the daily diet. To the contrary, the final
rule concerning calcium and osteoporosis, for example, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2665), permits a calcium health claim for dietary supplements and requires only that the supplement
labeling advise consumers, in appropriate circumstances, that there is no known benefit from consuming more than
200 percent of the recommended daily intake for calcium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 411 of the act does not authorize health claims for dietary supplements or in any way affect FDA's authority
under section 403(r)(5)(D) of the act to regulate such claims. Under section 411(a)(1)(B) of the act, FDA may not classify
a dietary supplement as a drug solely because it contains a vitamin or mineral at a level that exceeds the level of potency
that the agency determines is nutritionally rational or useful. Nothing in these proposed regulations would do so.
Absent a claim, FDA will not consider a dietary supplement to be a drug because it contains vitamins or minerals at levels
above those normally found in food. However, a claim on a product is an indication of the product's intended use. If
a claim reveals that the product is intended for a use other than for its taste, aroma, or nutritive value, then nothing
in section 411 of the act would require that it be treated as a food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Many comments addressed the circumstances under which dietary supplements should be considered drugs. A number
of these comments referred to the following agency statement in the health claims final rule (comment 49, 58 FR 2478
at 2501): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A product that is intended for medicinal effects, that is, intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment,
or prevention of disease, is a drug and not a food. Thus, there is no basis under the act for FDA to permit health claims
for herbs whose only known use is for medicinal effects. Health benefits of such herbs may appear in the labeling only
in accordance with the drug provisions of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although a few comments agreed with this statement, many comments expressed categorical opposition to the classification
of any herbs or other dietary supplements as drugs. While most of these comments did not offer reasons in support of
their position, one comment expressed concern that such a policy would be grounds for FDA to categorically ban all
such supplements as unapproved new drugs. Several comments noted that many herbs have traditionally been used both
as foods and drugs and asked for assurance that FDA would not automatically regulate such herbs as drugs. Other comments
argued that herbs should always be regulated as foods where they are consumed for their nutritive value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments stressed that intended use, as stated on its labeling, should be the determinative factor in deciding
whether a supplement should be regulated as a food or as a drug. As an example, one of these comments stated that a supplement
marketed for a specific therapeutic use (e.g., a vitamin C tablet sold to cure cancer) is appropriately regarded as
a drug, while a supplement sold to be taken over a period of time to reduce the risk of developing a disease (e.g., a vitamin
C tablet sold to be taken daily to reduce the risk of cancer) should be regulated as a food. The comment asserted that
this approach is consistent with FDA's determination that a supplement containing large amounts of niacin should
be regulated as a drug when consumed to lower serum cholesterol. Another of these comments emphasized that a consumer's
use of a legally labeled product should not have any weight in determining whether that product is a drug. As an example,
the comment noted that FDA does not regulate either fiber or water as a drug as long as their labeling does not bear drug
claims, even though consumers may use them to facilitate bowel movement or to prevent, mitigate, or treat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dehydration, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few comments suggested that FDA determine whether a substance is a food or a drug by its chemical composition. The
comments asserted that while the boundary between drugs and supplements is fuzzy at times, drugs are typically synthetic
molecules that are of a unique and patentable nature, while dietary supplements consist of natural, nonpatentable
materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment stated that FDA should exempt substances taken to treat a symptom of a disease from regulation as drugs,
as the act defines as drugs only those substances used in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention
of the disease itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Earlier in this preamble, FDA explained that these regulations do not affect the availability of dietary supplements.
Again, these regulations affect only the food label and food labeling. FDA has no intention of banning all dietary
supplements of herbs or similar substances as unapproved new drugs. FDA will carry out its responsibility to regulate
inappropriate claims, but the agency will not attempt to restrict the sale of dietary supplements to consumers unless
the supplements present safety concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the specific words for use in labeling statements, FDA advises that statements that a product may be
effective in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease will make the product a drug. However, statements
that a product may reduce the risk of developing a disease or health-related condition may, or may not, make the product
a drug. Exactly how a substance-disease relationship is to be characterized is one of the issues that the agency will
address in deciding whether to authorize a health claim and how to ensure that the claim describes the significance
of the substance in affecting the disease or health-related condition. FDA points out that as a general matter, merely
using terms such as ``reduce the risk'' instead of ``prevent'' will not automatically make a claim a health claim and
not a drug claim. FDA will make a case-by-case assessment based on all relevant factors in determining whether a claim
is appropriately subject to the health claims regime. The agency also agrees that the main focus in deciding whether
a product is subject to regulation as a food or a drug is the intent of the vendor and not how consumers use the product
(although how consumers understand claims that are made can be used to determine vendor intent). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that there is no provision in the act for the agency to exempt statements about symptoms of disease from
causing products to be regulated as drugs. Although such statements may not be claims that the product will treat the
disease that causes the symptoms, the statements clearly pertain to the mitigation of disease by addressing the symptoms
caused by the disease. Section 201(g)(1)(B) of the act provides, in part, that articles intended for use in the mitigation
of disease are drugs. Similarly, there is no provision in the act for FDA to exempt natural, nonpatentable materials
from the definition of a drug in section 201(g) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that it not true that all natural materials are not drugs. It has been estimated that about 25 percent of
the drugs currently prescribed by physicians are plant compounds, and that an additional 25 percent are related to
plants. Therefore, fully half of the drugs commonly used can be considered plant derived. Such commonly used drugs
as digitalis, aspirin, quinidine, atropine, and hundreds of others were once considered herbals. Thus, the agency
finds that it cannot rely on the distinction of whether a product is natural or synthetic in deciding whether it is a
food or a drug.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 101.14(b)(3)(ii) provides that, to justify a claim for a substance that is to be consumed at other than decreased
levels, the substance must be a food or a food ingredient or a component of a food ingredient whose use at the levels necessary
to justify a claim has been demonstrated by the proponent of the claim, to FDA's satisfaction, to be safe and lawful
under the applicable food safety provisions of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble of the dietary supplement health claims proposal (58 FR 33700 at 33709) explained:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
* * * This showing can be based on: (1) A demonstration that the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) within
the meaning of &sect;170.30; (2) a listing of the substance as GRAS in 21 CFR Part 182 or as affirmed as GRAS in 21 CFR Part
184; (3) a food additive regulation; or (4) a sanction or approval granted by FDA or the United States Department of
Agriculture prior to September 6, 1958. If the safety and lawfulness of the substance is not expressly recognized
in an FDA regulation, the burden will rest on the claim's proponent, as a prerequisite to FDA's evaluation of the health
claim, to submit all the scientific data and other relevant information required to demonstrate safety and lawfulness
in accordance with applicable petition requirements. FDA will withhold review of the health claim until it is satisfied
on these points.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
18. Many comments objected that the proposed safety provisions are unreasonable. A few of these comments specifically
asserted that herbal supplements would almost universally fail the proposed safety requirements because most herbs
are not GRAS for use as a dietary supplement, are not approved food additives, and are not the subject of prior sanctions
or are the subject of prior sanctions that have been waived. Furthermore, the comments complained that FDA's process
for acting on GRAS affirmation petitions is notoriously slow and extremely costly. The comments maintained that
the proposed safety requirements would discourage manufacturers from submitting health claim petitions for dietary
supplements, would delay the approval of such petitions, and could well amount to a total ban on health claims for certain
dietary supplements. The comments suggested that FDA require safety determinations only for those substances with
no history of safe use and provide that the absence of known safety problems will be sufficient proof of safety for substances
with a long history of use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other comments urged FDA to be flexible in its determination of safety for substances in dietary supplements. A number
of these comments stressed the importance of FDA recognizing that safety can be determined solely through the historical
use of such substances. Some of the comments noted that many components of supplements, particularly herbs, have
been used for hundreds or thousands of years without safety problems. The comments also noted that herbs are used safely
throughout three-fourths of the world as a principal means of medicine. The comments declared that regulatory authorities
in Great Britain, Germany, Japan, and many other nations have researched various herbal supplements and found them
to be safe when consumed at the levels of use likely to be contemplated under a health claim petition. One comment also
noted that information concerning accurate dosage, indications, contraindications, and quality control measures
are also available in past editions of the U.S. Pharmacopeias and National Formularies. These comments urged FDA
to accept all relevant data on the safe use of herbal dietary supplements, including foreign studies and monographs
that evidence the safety of these products. One comment declared that FDA is legally bound to consider evidence involving
herb usage outside the United States when reviewing the safety of herbs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asserted that FDA should evaluate the safety of vitamins and minerals in terms of their effect on the normal
population and not on those consumers with unusual conditions or sensitivities. The comment acknowledged that such
consumers need clear label ingredient statements as well as education on foods to deal with their problems. The comment
asserted, however, that these consumers should be held responsible for some degree of self-protection. The comment
maintained that this approach is consistent with the agency's policy on persons with allergies to food components.
A few comments asserted that the safety of a dietary supplement should be defined in terms of whether or not harm may
occur under the conditions of use defined by the supplement's labeling, rather than in terms of an arbitrary cutoff
such as the RDI. The comment maintained that a systematic review of all components of dietary supplements is not necessary
and suggested that the agency undertake safety reviews on a case-by-case basis where it believes a potential safety
concern might exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments asserted that FDA is not equitable in its concern for the safety of dietary supplements as compared
to the safety of other products regulated by the agency. Some comments asserted that the safety record of dietary supplements
is far better than many FDA-approved food additives such as aspartame, against which, according to the comments,
the agency receives and ignores thousands of consumer complaints annually. Other comments asserted that FDA's intense
interest in the safety of products would be better focused on prescription drugs, which are responsible for over 1/2
million deaths annually as compared to the no or few deaths attributable to the consumption of dietary supplements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, several comments supported FDA's proposal to require that petitioners for a health claim for a substance
in a dietary supplement demonstrate that the substance is safe and lawful. The comments agreed with the agency that
such a requirement is implicit in the act, and that the labeling law in no way diminishes FDA's responsibility to ensure
the safety of foods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA concludes that the preliminary requirement that the safety of a substance be demonstrated should apply to substances
in dietary supplements in the same manner that it applies to substances in foods in conventional food form. The amendment
to the act enacted by the 1990 amendments cannot be implemented independently of the remaining portions of the act
(see section 9 of the 1990 amendments). The act must be considered as a whole, and FDA's responsibility for ensuring
the safety of foods is explicitly provided for in other sections of the act (see sections 201(s), 402(a)(1) and (2),
and 409 of the act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the agency explained in the dietary supplement health claims proposal, the fact that the act contains such explicit
safety authority is particularly significant because the agency will be specifically authorizing the health claims
that will be made. In view of this affirmative action, FDA authorization of a health claim places the agency's imprimatur
on the claim. Moreover, the claim will encourage consumption of the substance. It would be a violation of the agency's
responsibility under the act to authorize a health claim about a substance, whether it be in a dietary supplement or
in food in conventional food form, without being satisfied that the use of the substance is safe. Certainly, FDA would
have almost no assurance that it would be protecting the public health if it permitted, as some comments suggest, all
substances except those that are actually known to cause safety problems to be the subject of health claims. It would
be a great and tragic irony if substances that were the subject of health claims because of one effect caused injury
because of another. This is the situation that Congress sought to avert by including section 403(r)(3)(A)(ii) in
the act. FDA's preliminary requirement is fully consistent with the principles that underlie that section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fact that some herbs and other ingredients of dietary supplements have been used for thousands of years does not
necessarily justify a conclusion by FDA that their use under all conditions is safe, but it may. First, FDA needs a basis
for concluding that such use was in fact without harmful effect. Second, FDA needs a basis for concluding that consumption
of ingredients in a supplement carrying a health claim would be in amounts comparable to those consumed safely in the
past. The proponents of claims for such substances are certainly free to demonstrate that the use of those substances
is generally recognized as safe based on their common use in food prior to 1958. The agency notes, however, that the
use of many of these substances has been primarily as a drug, tonic, or folk remedy, rather than as food (see 53 FR 16544
at 16545; May 10, 1988). This fact is confirmed by some of the comments summarized above. As drugs, the levels and frequency
of use of these substances may have been significantly different than the levels and frequency of use that will result
from their use as foods. Although the agency will consider evidence involving herb usage outside the United States,
FDA still needs to review data on the identity of the substance, the safety of the substance, the use of the substance
in food, the context of its use, and the frequency of use in the country where use of the substance occurred (see 50 FR
27294 at 27295, July 2, 1985). Evidence that another country has studied the safety of an herbal supplement and found
it to be safe would certainly be relevant and should be submitted to FDA. It is important, however, that as much of the
evidence that provided the basis for the country's determination as is possible be submitted to FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although formal recognition of safety by FDA admittedly can be lengthy and expensive, such formal recognition is
not required under this preliminary requirement. In responding to concerns raised by comments suggesting that FDA
recognize manufacturers' private GRAS determinations, the agency stated in the health claims final rule the following
concerning &sect;101.14(b)(3)(ii) (58 FR 2478 at 2502 through 2503):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA acknowledges that the GRAS affirmation and food additive listing process can be lengthy. Thus, FDA designed &sect;101.14(b)(3)(ii)
to provide flexibility with respect to the type of showing of safety that is necessary to make a substance eligible
to be the subject of a health claim. GRAS affirmation and food additive listing are but two of the procedures by which
a substance may meet this preliminary requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA intends to consider the basis of manufacturers' independent GRAS determinations where such determinations
are submitted with petitions for health claims and may use its discretion to accept, without formal affirmation,
the independent determination of GRAS where FDA believes that such action would be appropriate. As FDA pointed out
in the previous comment, however, the agency would not be fulfilling its responsibilities under the act if it were
to permit a substance to be the subject of a health claim without satisfying itself that the use of that substance is
safe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Although FDA will consider all manufacturers' independent GRAS determinations where the basis for such determinations
are submitted with petitions for health claims, the agency advises that it will generally not be possible for FDA to
judge whether GRAS determinations based on complex scientific evidence are valid within the short timeframes mandated
under the 1990 amendments for health claims petitions. Instead, agency agreement with an independent determination
that a substance is GRAS will be most likely where the substance is an ingredient, or a component of a food ingredient,
that was in common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, in a similar context. However, where such agreement occurs,
the agreement does not constitute GRAS affirmation. Instead, the history of common use in food, coupled with the fact
that FDA knows of no reason to question the safety of the food ingredient, means that the substance will be treated as
if it is an unlisted GRAS substance (as provided for in &sect; 170.30(d) and 182.1(a) (21 CFR 170.30(d) and 182.1(a)))
in the manner provided for in the food ingredient list in 21 CFR Part 182.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(58 FR 2478 at 2503.)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this final rule, this statement is fully applicable to substances in dietary supplements. The agency believes
that this policy on independent determinations that a substance is GRAS demonstrates that FDA will be flexible in
assessing conformance with the safety preliminary requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with assertions that the agency should evaluate the safety of dietary supplements in terms of only the
normal population. It would be unconscionable for the agency to adopt a policy of ignoring adverse effects, some of
which could be life-threatening, of any foods, including dietary supplements, on vulnerable segments of the population.
Furthermore, there is no basis under the act for such a policy. FDA does attempt, however, to find the most practicable
solutions to assuring consumers of a safe food supply. For example, the agency generally does not base safety decisions
on atypical population subgroups that will use the product. Where there are subgroups of consumers (e.g., consumers
with certain sensitivities) that could suffer adverse effects from consuming the product, FDA may place certain
restrictions on the use of the product or rely on labeling solutions (such as those the agency has used for sulfiting
agents and yellow 5) as a condition for its safe use, rather than denying the availability of the product to the entire
population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, for all the foregoing reasons, FDA is making health claims for substances in dietary supplements, like claims
for any other food, subject to &sect;101.14(b)(3)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Scientific Standard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
19. Many comments expressed concern that FDA would apply the term ``significant scientific agreement'' in an unreasonable
manner by demanding too much supporting evidence on substance/disease relationships before approving health claims.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several comments insisted that FDA is misinterpreting the requirements for the scientific standard for food in conventional
food form as well as for dietary supplements. The comments asserted that the law does not require that there be significant
scientific agreement that a nutrient/disease relationship has been conclusively established, but only that the
statements made in a claim be supported by the available evidence. As an example, one of the comments asserted that
the requirements of the law would be fully met by a properly qualified label claim such as, ``Although no scientific
consensus has been established, several clinical studies suggest that daily consumption of Vitamin C as part of a
well-balanced diet may reduce the frequency of colds.'' A number of comments asserted that the standards for authorizing
health claims on foods are more stringent than those authorizing the use of drug claims. Several comments argued that
FDA is being unduly restrictive by requiring that manufacturers perform expensive randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
tests to prove the validity of a claim under the proposed regulations. These comments stated that such requirements
would deter manufacturers from seeking new uses for herbs and other substances used in dietary supplements. The comments
maintained that a more lenient standard would encourage manufacturers to engage in research to develop more healthful
products. The comments further asserted that the disparate treatment of foods and drugs is especially unfair when
the enormous difference in safety factors between dietary supplements and untested prescription drugs is considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the comments asserted that FDA had not been fair to date in its evaluations of health claims under this standard.
One of these comments asserted that FDA had approved only four of the ten congressionally-proposed health claims,
not seven, as FDA claimed in the preamble to the proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments maintained that FDA should not require a unanimous or near-unanimous consensus among experts in order
to find that there is ``significant scientific agreement'' concerning a claim. A few of the comments pointed out that
the legislative history of the 1990 amendments clearly indicates that such a level of agreement is not to be required.
Other comments urged that FDA consider the requirement for ``significant scientific agreement'' to be satisfied
as long as there is agreement among a majority of scientists familiar with the research in a given area. These comments
noted that Commissioner Kessler offered testimony supporting this interpretation before the U.S. House of Representatives
Subcommittee on Health and the Environment. Other comments maintained that the requirement for ``significant scientific
agreement'' only requires agreement among a significant number of qualified experts. One of these comments requested
that FDA include a provision in the regulations that the standard of ``significant scientific agreement'' is not
one of unanimity to prevent confusion among manufacturers and consumers. A few comments asked that FDA's regulations
include a provision that guarantees that ``significant scientific agreement'' will be considered to have been achieved
when a credible health authority, particularly an agency of the U.S. Government, recommends the consumption of a
nutrient because of its relationship to a disease or health-related condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested that FDA not use the phrase ``significant scientific agreement'' to evaluate proposed health
claims, despite its inclusion in the language of the 1990 amendments, because the meaning of the phrase is ambiguous.
The comment suggested that FDA should simply consider the totality of publicly available scientific evidence to
determine whether or not a particular health claim can be justified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with assertions that it is conducting validity assessments for health claims in an unduly restrictive
manner. FDA does not require that manufacturers perform controlled clinical trials to prove the validity of a claim.
To the contrary, as discussed in the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2506), the scientific standard for health
claims is less stringent than the requirements for approval of a new drug. In the case of a new drug, section 505(d)(5)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 355(d)(5)) states that the Secretary shall refuse to approve an application for approval of such
a drug where there is a lack of substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect that it purports or is represented
to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof. Section
505(d) provides further that the term ``substantial evidence'' means evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled
investigations, including clinical investigations (human studies conducted in a controlled clinical setting),
by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved. (The
statutory term ``substantial evidence'' should not be confused with the same term used by some comments to refer to
``more than a scintilla and less than a preponderance'' of evidence.) Based on this statutory direction, the agency
has identified a number of characteristics that are present in ``adequate and well-controlled'' studies in &sect;314.126
(21 CFR 314.126).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 101.14(c) of FDA regulations does not mandate requirements as stringent as those for drugs in section 505(d)(5)
of the act. Section 101.14(c) contains no mention of ``substantial evidence,'' ``adequate and well-controlled
investigations,'' or of ``clinical investigations.'' To the contrary, &sect;101.14(c) contains more flexibility
than the drug provisions of the act because it provides FDA with authority to authorize claims based on ``scientific
evidence (including evidence from well-designed studies conducted in a manner which is consistent with generally
recognized scientific procedures and principles), that there is significant agreement among experts qualified
by scientific training and experience to evaluate such claims, that the claim is supported by such evidence'' (section
403(r)(3)(B)(i) of the act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with this flexibility, FDA did not prescribe a specific set, type, or number of studies as being sufficient
to support a health claim in the health claims final rule that applied to food in conventional food form. In that rule,
the agency advised (58 FR 2478 at 2506) that it would consider all relevant data on a topic, including clinical studies,
epidemiological data, and animal studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the 1990 amendments directed FDA to consider 10 nutrient-disease relationships. In the January 6, 1993,
final rules, FDA authorized claims with respect to seven of those 10 relationships (see 58 FR 2537, 2552, 2622, 2665,
2739, 2787, and 2820). In addition, FDA has recently proposed to authorize claims concerning an eighth, folic acid
and neural tube defects (see 58 FR 53254, October 14, 1993). FDA believes that these approvals demonstrate that it
is not conducting validity assessments for health claims in an unduly restrictive manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that the legislative history of the 1990 amendments makes clear that Congress did not intend, in calling
for significant scientific agreement about the support for a claim, to require that such agreement represents a full
consensus among scientists. The House Report (Ref. 1) states: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
* * * the standard does not require that there be a unanimous agreement among experts. Instead there must be a significant
agreement among experts, but it does not require that every expert in the field approve or agree with the claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency shares the comments' concern that a requirement of consensus would mean that some valid health claims would
not be authorized and, by restricting such claims, would counter Congress' intent that health claims supported by
a significant scientific agreement be made available to consumers. The agency never intended to require that claims
be supported by a consensus among scientists and has not done so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is sensitive to the comments' perception that the scientific standard, particularly the phrase ``significant
scientific agreement,'' is subjective. The agency believes, however, that any standard involving the evaluation
of scientific evidence and opinions derived from that evidence must be somewhat subjective. FDA, in proposing not
to define ``significant agreement'' among experts in the November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60537 at 60548) proposal, noted
that each situation may differ with the nature of the claimed substance/disease relationship. The agency believes
that in deciding whether significant scientific agreement about the validity of a claim exists, it is necessary to
consider both the extent of agreement and the nature of the disagreement on a case-by-case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The House Report (Ref. 1) makes clear that Congress intended the ``significant scientific agreement'' standard
to be a flexible one by pointing out that, in reviewing scientific studies, FDA may give greater weight to the studies
that it finds more persuasive. The House Report also clarifies that the overriding consideration in assessing whether
to authorize a claim should be the Secretary's level of comfort about the validity of the claim. The agency believes
that this clarification provides clear guidance for the application of the standard, and thus it is not incorporating
the changes requested by the comments in the codified language of the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not believe it has in any way been unfair in its approval of health claims to date. Earlier in this preamble in
response to comment 2, FDA explained why certain specific health claims were not approved. Nevertheless, the agency's
statement in the dietary supplement health claims proposal that it had authorized claims on 7 of the 10 nutrient-disease
relationships is correct. In the case of 3 of the relationships, however, the claims were authorized for foods rather
than specific nutrients. In these cases, as explained previously, although there was sufficient evidence to attribute
certain disease risk reductions to the consumption of certain foods, and those foods are marked by significant levels
of the nutrients in question, there was insufficient evidence to attribute any disease risk reduction directly to
consumption of the nutrients themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not agree that it should define ``significant scientific agreement'' as agreement among a majority of scientists
familiar with the issues. Commissioner Kessler's statements about significant scientific agreement being 50 or
60 percent agreement were intended to show the contrast between this term and the term ``consensus,'' not to provide
a specific definition of ``significant scientific agreement.'' There is simply no bright line that FDA can draw in
this area. Ultimately, the agency must exercise its scientific judgment, arrived at after input from the scientific
community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency does not agree that significant scientific agreement should be considered to have been achieved when a
credible health authority, particularly an agency of the U.S. Government, recommends the consumption of a nutrient
because of its relationship to a disease or health-related condition. While FDA recognizes the significance of such
recommendations, Congress charged FDA with the responsibility of authorizing health claims on the food label and
labeling. Nonetheless, the agency is mindful of the admonition in section 403(r)(4)(C) of the act that reads: ``If
a petition for a regulation under subparagraph (3)(B) relies on a report from an authoritative scientific body of
the United States, the Secretary shall consider such report and shall justify any decision rejecting the conclusions
of such report.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FDA is retaining the requirement for ``significant scientific agreement'' in this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Many comments applauded the agency's determination not to underrate any scientific evidence on the basis of its
cultural or geographic origin. One of these comments noted that the United States is one of the most ethnically diverse
nations in the world and stated that a study done anywhere in the world is likely to be relevant to at least one U.S. subpopulation.
A few of these comments noted that some of the studies done on herbal dietary supplements have been conducted under
foreign drug protocols and requested assurance that FDA would consider such data to be part of the publicly available
scientific evidence supporting prospective health claims. Another of these comments asserted that the ``totality
of publicly available scientific evidence'' should include not only ``well designed studies'' but also ethnobotanical
and other traditional usage information which is often available for herbs and other dietary supplements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency reaffirms its commitment to consider any evidence submitted in support of the scientific merits of a claim
and in the context of the totality of available evidence. FDA will not underrate any study on the basis of its cultural
or geographic origin. Evidence in support of a proposed health claim, however, will attain value in direct proportion
to the significance in the U.S. population of the effects of the substance in question on the disease or health-related
condition addressed by the claim (see &sect;101.14(b)(1)). Also, the agency advises that it will consider ethnobotanical
and other traditional usage information. However, the agency points out that under &sect;101.14(c), the evidence
must provide the basis for significant scientific agreement that the claim is valid.

D. General Labeling Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the health claims final rule, FDA established a number of general requirements for health claims for food in conventional
food form in &sect;101.14(d) to ensure that consumers are provided with valid and reliable information about the
value that ingestion (or reduced ingestion) of a particular substance, as part of a total dietary pattern, may have
in affecting certain diseases or health-related conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the dietary supplement health claims proposal, the agency proposed that dietary supplements be subject to the
same general requirements that it has established for food in conventional food form in &sect;101.14(d). The agency
advised that specific references to dietary supplements in &sect;101.14(d) are not necessary because FDA's revision
of &sect;101.14(a)(2), the definition of the term ``substance,'' to include components of dietary supplements
will link dietary supplements to the health claim for which &sect;101.14(d) prescribes general requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. FDA Authorization of Valid Claims
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 101.14(d)(1) provides that when FDA determines that a health claim is valid, the agency will propose a regulation
in Subpart E of Part 101 to authorize the use of the claim. Further, the provision states that if the claim pertains to
a substance not provided for in &sect;101.9, FDA will propose to amend that regulation to include declaration of the
substance. To ensure that the provisions established in &sect;101.14(d)(1) apply equally to all forms of dietary
supplements, the agency proposed in the dietary supplement proposal to revise &sect;101.14(d)(1) to reference,
in addition to &sect;101.9, the provisions of &sect;101.36 (21 CFR 101.36), which establish requirements for the
nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received no comments requesting changes in this aspect of the proposal. Therefore, the agency is adopting this
section as proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. General Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 101.14(d)(2) requires that health claims on foods in conventional food form: (1) Be consistent with the specific
authorizing regulation for the claim; (2) be limited to describing the value that ingestion (or reduced ingestion)
of the substance, as part of a total dietary pattern, may have on a particular disease or health-related condition;
(3) be complete, truthful, and not misleading; (4) contain all required information for that claim in one place without
other intervening material (except that the principal display panel (PDP) of the label or labeling may bear a reference
statement such as ``See attached pamphlet for information about calcium and osteoporosis,'' with the entire claim
appearing elsewhere on the other labeling); and (5) enable the public to comprehend the information provided and
to understand the relative significance of such information in the context of a total daily diet. If the claim is about
the effects of consuming the substance at decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance in the food must be sufficiently
low to justify the claim. For example, if a definition for use of the term ``low'' has been established for that substance,
the substance must be present at a level that meets the requirements for use of that term, unless a specific alternative
level has been established for the substance in the authorizing regulation. If the claim is about the effects of consuming
the substance at other than decreased dietary levels, the level of the substance in the food must be sufficiently high
and in an appropriate form to justify the claim. For example, if a definition for use of the term ``high'' for that substance
has been established, the substance must be present at a level that meets the requirements for use of that term, unless
a specific alternative level has been established for the substance in the authorizing regulation. (See &sect;101.14(d)(2)(vii)(A)
for additional requirements where the food meets the ``high'' or ``low'' requirements based on its reference amount
customarily consumed and the labeled serving size differs from that amount. See &sect;101.14(d)(2)(vii)(B) for
guidance about how a food can meet the ``high'' and ``low'' requirements where the food is sold in a restaurant.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the dietary supplement health claims proposal, FDA proposed that dietary supplements be subject to these requirements
to ensure that consumers are provided with scientifically valid, nonmisleading, and reliable information about
the value that ingestion of the particular substance in the dietary supplement may have in affecting a disease or health-related
condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. One comment stated that FDA should mandate that dietary supplements bear health claims for which they are eligible
in order to promote public awareness of the benefits associated with those supplements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not believe that it is appropriate to adopt a general policy requiring the inclusion of health claims on the
labels of all foods eligible to bear them. The agency notes that while the 1990 amendments provide for the appearance
of health claims on the labels of foods qualified to bear them, they do not make the appearance of those claims mandatory.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that many manufacturers will choose to include health claims on the labels of qualified foods because
of the marketing benefit offered by their appearance. Because health claims provide information regarding the benefits
associated with the increased or decreased dietary intake of various substances in the product rather than information
regarding the particular product itself, consumers will be made aware of the benefits of consuming other foods that
do or do not contain the particular substance, even if a particular food product does not itself bear the health claim.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. One comment asserted that FDA should require manufacturers who elect to craft their own health claims, rather
than to use the model claim verbatim, to secure agency approval for their claims with respect to understandability.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with this comment. Section 3(b)(1)(A)(vii) of the 1990 amendments prohibits FDA from requiring persons
to secure agency approval before placing a health claim on a product, provided that the claim is in compliance with
the applicable regulation authorizing the health claim. The House Report (Ref. 1) states that this section ``makes
it clear that the regulations will not require premarket review of each claim; they will only require that the claim
be consistent with the terms and requirements of the regulations.'' The agency believes that it is possible to paraphrase
a model health claim while remaining consistent with the terms and requirements of the regulations permitting that
claim. This position is similar to agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy that permits the use of terminology other than that established in a final OTC drug monograph in labeling of
an OTC drug product to describe indications for use (51 FR 16258, May 1, 1986). Consistent with that policy for OTC drug
labeling, the agency believes that the goal of ensuring scientifically valid, truthful, and nonmisleading labeling
without inhibiting effective consumer communication does not require exclusive use of language in a model health
claim. The model language along with other requirements for a claim will, nevertheless, provide the standard for
measuring the accuracy of alternative language developed by food manufacturers for their products because FDA has
included all mandatory labeling elements of a health claim in the model claim. Of course, manufacturers should recognize
that a health claim that fails to convey all the mandatory elements of the claim will subject a product to regulatory
action.

3. Nutrition Labeling
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 101.14(d)(3) requires that health claims on foods in conventional food form must bear nutrition labeling
in accordance with &sect; 101.9 and 101.10 (21 CFR 101.9 and 101.10). In the dietary supplement health claims proposal,
the agency proposed to revise &sect;101.14(d) to reference &sect;101.36 (21 CFR 101.36), in addition to &sect; 101.9
and 101.10. In response to section 403(q)(5)(F) of the act (formerly section 403(q)(5)(E)), &sect;101.36 establishes
requirements for the nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received no comments requesting changes in this aspect of the proposal. Therefore, the agency is adopting this
section as proposed.

E. Prohibited Health Claims
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;101.14(e) of the health claims final rule, FDA established, for foods in conventional food form, a number
of situations where health claims are prohibited. In that paragraph, FDA provides that a health claim may not be made
on the label or in the labeling of a food unless: (1) The claim is specifically provided for in authorizing regulations
in Subpart E of 21 CFR part 101; (2) the claim conforms to all general provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;101.14, as well as to all specific provisions in the authorizing regulation; (3) none of the disqualifying
levels identified in &sect;101.14(a)(5) is exceeded in the food, unless specific alternative levels have been established
for the substance in the authorizing regulation, and the labeling bears a statement that complies with &sect;101.13(h)
highlighting the nutrient that exceeds the disqualifying level; (4) no substance is present at an inappropriate
level as determined in the specific provision authorizing the claim in Subpart E of 21 CFR part 101; (5) the label does
not represent or purport that the food is for infants and toddlers less than 2 years of age except if the claim is specifically
provided for in Subpart E of 21 CFR part 101; and (6) except for dietary supplements, the food contains 10 percent or
more of the RDI or Daily Reference Value (DRV) for vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or fiber before any
nutrient addition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the dietary supplement health claims proposal, the agency proposed that dietary supplements be subject to the
general prohibitions that have been established for foods in conventional food form in &sect;101.14(e). The agency
tentatively concluded that this action was appropriate because these prohibitions: (1) Reflect the statutory restriction
in section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act that requires that health claims be made in accordance with the provisions of section
403(r)(5)(D) for dietary supplements; (2) ensure that inappropriate, unsubstantiated, and fraudulent health
claims are not made; and (3) reduce the potential for consumer confusion when confronted with a situation in which
there would be health claims for substances when they are present in dietary supplements but not when they are present
in foods in conventional food form. The agency advised that specific references to dietary supplements in &sect;101.14(e)
generally are not necessary because FDA's proposed revision in &sect;101.14(a)(2) of the definition of the term
``substance'' to include components of dietary supplements will bring dietary supplements within the coverage
of &sect;101.14(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA did propose, however, to include a reference to dietary supplements in the introductory sentence of paragraph
(e) to clarify that dietary supplements may be food. Specifically, FDA proposed to insert the phrase ``regardless
of whether the food is in conventional food form or dietary supplement form'' into that sentence to make clear that
no expressed or implied health claims may be made on the label or in labeling of any food unless the conditions in that
paragraph are met.

1. Claims Not Authorized By FDA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 101.14(e)(1) and (e)(2) prohibit the use on a food label or in food labeling of any claim that expressly or by
implication characterizes the relationship of any substance to a disease or health-related condition unless: (1)
The claim is specifically provided for in Part 101, Subpart E_Specific Requirements for Health Claims; and (2) the
claim conforms to all general provisions of &sect;101.14, as well as to all specific provisions in the appropriate
section in subpart E of 21 CFR part 101. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23. A number of comments asserted that the marketplace is currently saturated with hundreds of false and misleading
claims, ranging from rather innocuous statements to blatant claims concerning the treatment of cancer, AIDS, heart
disease, asthma, high blood pressure, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and other diseases and health-related conditions.
One of these comments urged FDA to regulate as implied health claims those brand names that imply that a product is useful
in preventing particular diseases. The comment asserted that an implied health claim can be made by the inclusion
of the name of a disease in a brand name, as well as by label statements that slant the meaning of a brand name toward disease
prevention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA realizes there are a number of misleading claims in use on products. The agency reviews these claims as part of its
regular enforcement activities and takes action against such claims based on such factors as the public health significance
of the claim, how clearly it violates the act, and the availability of agency resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24. A number of comments stated that manufacturers should be allowed to include information on the traditional use
of various supplements on their labels. These comments noted that many other countries allow supplement labels to
indicate traditional uses of the product, provided that the level of evidence supporting such use is accurately represented.
Many comments asserted that statements concerning the safe usage of dietary supplements should not be considered
a health claim. The comments maintained that the exclusion of such information from food labeling would endanger
the public health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dietary supplements that bear labeling that expressly or by implication characterizes the relationship of any substance
to a disease or health-related condition will be subject to the provisions of section 403(r) of the act. However, if
the claim reveals that the product is intended to be used in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention
of a disease, as would likely be the situation where the product is presented as an alternative to conventional drug
therapy, the product, like any other product that does so, is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the act and subject
to the requirements for drugs in Chapter V of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, supplement manufacturers, like all other food manufacturers, are welcome to submit health claim petitions
that establish the validity of claims that characterize the relationship of a substance to a disease or a health-related
condition in a manner that is appropriate for a food. (See section III.G. of this document.) Any such petition that
shows that the preliminary requirements in &sect;101.14(b) and the scientific standard for a health claim in &sect;101.14(c)
are met will provide the basis for a proposal to authorize a claim in accordance with section 403(r)(4)(A)(i) of the
act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA advises manufacturers of dietary supplements that where a claim does not include one or both of the
basic elements of a health claim, it generally constitutes dietary guidance that may be provided on the label or in
labeling, so long as it is presented in a truthful and nonmisleading manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
25. One comment urged that FDA permit the appearance of preliminary health claims on the labeling of a product other
than its label. The comment maintained that the 1990 amendments draw a clear distinction between a product label and
its labeling and noted that labeling has much more room in which a manufacturer may sufficiently explain the current
state of scientific evidence regarding a preliminary claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with this comment. Section 403(r)(1) of the act clearly prohibits the appearance of health claims that
are not made in accordance with FDA regulations and that appear ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in the label or labeling 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the food (emphasis added).'' The agency's objections to preliminary claims are fully discussed in this preamble
in its response to comment 4.

2. Additional Limits on Health Claims
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2534), FDA adopted new &sect;101.14(e)(6) to require consistency with
dietary guidelines by prohibiting health claims unless the food contains 10 percent or more of the RDI or DRV for vitamin
A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, or fiber per reference amount customarily consumed prior to any nutrient addition.
(A complete discussion of why these specific criteria were selected appears in the preamble of that document (see
58 FR 2478 at 2521 through 2522).) This provision stresses the importance of selecting foods so that dietary sources
of calories are coupled with sources of nutrients. This approach incorporates established levels of significance
for nutrients in food and is based on the amounts in foods of certain nutrients required to be listed on the label as part
of mandatory nutrition labeling. As such, this approach applies to food in conventional food form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA specifically exempted dietary supplements from this requirement. Such supplements are intended only to provide
nutritive value to the daily diet, and they make no pretense of serving as substitutes for conventional food. (Nutrient
supplements in conventional food form are, however, intended to serve as substitutes for conventional food.) As
a result, it would not be logical to hold such products to criteria designed to ensure consistency with dietary guidelines
for conventional food. A dietary supplement that meets the qualifying criterion in &sect;101.14(d)(2)(vii) and
that does not contain a nutrient at a disqualifying level specified in &sect;101.14(a)(5) possesses nutritive value
for a health claim irrespective of whether or not it may also provide calories. Accordingly, in the dietary supplement
health claims proposal, FDA did not propose to make any change in the exemption for dietary supplements from the provisions
of &sect;101.14(e)(6). For consistency with the proposed definition of the term ``dietary supplement,'' however,
FDA proposed to revise the wording for this exemption to delete the phrase ``not in conventional food form'' because
the definition of ``dietary supplement'' states that such foods are not in conventional food form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received no comments requesting changes in this aspect of the proposal. Therefore, the agency is adopting this
section as proposed.

F. Applicability

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the health claims final rule, FDA established a provision in &sect;101.14(g) stating that the requirements for
health claims in &sect;101.14 apply to foods intended for human consumption that are offered for sale. In the dietary
supplement proposal, FDA proposed that dietary supplements also be covered by &sect;101.14(g). FDA stated that
it had tentatively concluded that a reference to dietary supplements was appropriate in paragraph (g) to clarify
that dietary supplements can be food. Specifically, FDA proposed to revise paragraph (g) as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The requirements of this section apply to foods intended for human consumption that are offered for sale, regardless
of whether the foods are in conventional food form or dietary supplement form.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
26. One comment asserted that FDA should allow health claims authorized for use on dietary supplements to also appear
on OTC drug products that provide ``high'' levels of a particular nutrient, e.g., calcium-osteoporosis claims on
calcium carbonate antacid tablets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received a comment similar to this one on the health claims proposal. This comment provides no basis for the agency
to provide a different response to this comment than it did in the health claims final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the preamble of the health claims final rule (58 FR 2478 at 2500), multiple use products that are both
foods and drugs present a difficult set of competing concerns for the agency. Such products are likely to be both an
OTC drug and a dietary supplement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most OTC drug products are developed to address some type of acute medical problem that is expected to be of short duration.
If the problem persists, it is important that the person with the problem know that it may be more severe than he or she
otherwise thought, and that he or she should seek medical attention. Labeling on such products, therefore, includes
instructions to use the product for a limited period of time and, if the problem persists, to seek medical intervention.
Thus, the time limits on use of the product are important to the health of the users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dietary supplements, on the other hand, are developed for inclusion in a daily diet at levels that are consistent with
dietary use and may often be consumed throughout most of a person's lifetime. Labeling on dietary supplements contains
no instructions for seeking medical intervention or for limiting the duration of consumption of the supplement.
Rather, under the new regulations, dietary supplements will be able to bear nutrient content and health claims, which
focus the consumer's attention on the advantages that consuming the product will have in helping the consumer to maintain
a healthy diet. Moreover, where the supplement bears a health claim, the claim will contain information about how
long-term ingestion of the supplement may promote health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where dietary levels and therapeutic levels differ (as is generally the case and is in fact the case with antacids and
calcium supplements), an apparent conflict is created when both food and drug labeling appear on the same product.
In the case of the drug labeling, consumers are given directions for use that involve high consumption during a limited
time period. In the case of the food labeling, consumers are given directions for lower consumption with no time constraints.
Even though label instructions may identify those directions for food and drug use in separate locations, FDA is concerned
that consumers will incorrectly assume that the therapeutic dosage is appropriate for dietary use, and that the directions
for food use will undercut the warning in the drug labeling to seek medical care if the condition persists. Where the
labeling is not properly followed, significant adverse consequences may result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency knows of no broad approach that it can use to harmonize a nutrient content claim or a health claim with drug
labeling. A drug that is labeled with instructions for use that both limit and do not limit consumption would be misbranded
under section 502(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(a)) if it failed to contain a material fact_that is, how to reconcile
these conflicting instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, FDA does not believe that it would be appropriate to preclude such claims under all circumstances. Such claims
may be permissible if a firm can demonstrate that dual claims can be made in a manner that will neither misbrand the product
nor create a safety problem. The agency suggests that anyone desiring to make a health claim or a nutrient content claim
that complies with section 403(r) of the act on a product that is both a food and a drug contact the Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research, OTC Compliance Branch (HFD&hyph;312), FDA, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, to discuss whether
it would be possible to put such a claim on the product and still comply with the drug provisions of the act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
27. A number of comments urged FDA to streamline its procedures for approving health claims in order that dietary supplement
manufacturers may include the most current, reliable information on their products. The comments stated that the
inclusion of such information is critically important to dietary supplements because, unlike foods in conventional
food form, they are consumed only for the health benefits associated with them. The comments specifically proposed
that FDA add the following paragraphs to &sect;101.70(j):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
 Final Rule
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. FDA will, within 120 days of the date of publication of the proposed rule, issue a final rule authorizing or prohibiting
the requested use of the health claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
 Expedited Action on certain petitions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. If FDA determines during its initial review of the petition that it accurately represents the recommendations of
any agency or department of the U.S. Government with public health responsibilities, or of any other public health
organization that is recognized as a credible source of information on diet and health, FDA will publish a proposed
rule authorizing the requested use of the claim no later than 60 days from the date of receipt of the petition and will
issue a final rule no later than 60 days from the date of publication of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments maintained that new provision in paragraph (j)(4) would correct an obvious oversight in the existing
regulations, i.e., the establishment of a firm deadline for a proposed rule but no firm deadline for a final rule. The
comments also contended that paragraph (j)(5) is necessary to address FDA's failure to act promptly to approve claims
that are based on the recommendations of public health authorities, such as its failure to approve a health claim for
folic acid in accord with the recommendations of PHS agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that its failure to specify in &sect;101.70(j) a deadline for the publication of a final rule regarding
the use of a proposed health claim was not an oversight. Section 403(r)(4)(A)(i) does not require that the agency adhere
to any deadline for the publication of a final rule. While FDA could establish such a timeframe by regulation, it does
not believe that the adoption of such a requirement would be prudent. The comment period following the publication
of proposed rules is a critical step in determining whether a proposed regulation is appropriate for adoption. In
the instance of health claim regulations, significant information concerning the validity of the substance-disease
relationship underlying the proposed health claim may be submitted by interested parties during the comment period.
Also, the comment period may bring to light a previously unforeseen potential for the use of a health claim, if adopted
without modification, to be misleading to consumers or to create serious potential threats to the public health.
The agency has no way to guarantee that it will be able to adequately resolve such problems within the suggested timeframe.
In such instances, if faced with a specific timeframe, FDA would be forced to either deny an otherwise valid health
claim petition, or to approve it without erecting the regulatory framework that it believes necessary to ensure that
the public health is safeguarded. Therefore, FDA is not adopting the suggested time limit on the issuance of a final
rule. However, the agency advises that it committed to issuing final rules on health claim petitions as quickly as
possible consistent with the issues presented and the agency's available resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to suggestions for shorter timeframes for certain petitions, FDA advises that the agency's ability
to meet timeframes is influenced by many factors, such as work priorities and availability of personnel. FDA considers
the statutory timeframes for assessing the validity of health claims and for issuing a proposed regulation to be extremely
short, given the need to evaluate the totality of available scientific evidence on a substance and a disease or a health-related
condition. Given the agency's limited resources, it would not be practicable to shorten these timeframes further.
However, FDA points out that although action on petitions for most claims will require virtually all of the time provided
by the statutory timeframes, nothing would prohibit the agency from acting in less time than the timeframes provide
if it is possible to do so. Thus, it is likely that a petition for a claim on a well-accepted substance/disease relationship
would be reviewed more expeditiously than one for which scientific agreement is not as clear.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
28. A few comments urged FDA to consider the limited label space available on many dietary supplements in developing
model health claims. The comments stated that concise model claims will provide guidance to manufacturers on how
to convey health claims in succinct statements that comply with all of FDA's requirements and will thus help ensure
that the health claims presented to consumers are clear and comprehensible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA realizes that there is a limit to the amount of information that can be presented on a food label. However, the agency
believes that it must ensure that consumers understand that factors other than dietary intake of the nutrient may
bear on the substance-disease relationship. Given the imperative of ensuring consumer understanding of a message
that must be presented in a very limited space, the agency is faced with the difficult task of determining what information
is necessary in a claim, and what information is not. FDA believes that its regulations in subpart E of 21 CFR part 101
represent an acceptable balance between the consumer's right to understand the full context of the claim and the manufacturer's
concern over claim length. By delineating the information that is mandatory and optional in a claim, FDA is relieving
manufacturers from having to include information that is of tangential importance but ensuring that those who wish
to make a claim do so in a manner that provides a useful and understandable message to consumers. FDA advises that it
will take a similar approach when providing model health claims in the future. FDA also notes that manufacturers who
are not satisfied with the model claim are free to develop their own versions of the claim, provided that those versions
include all of the information required by the authorizing regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
29. Several comments raised the issue of product-specific health claims by asserting that many manufacturers will
be dissuaded from undertaking the scientific studies and other investments necessary to obtain approval of new health
claims petitions by the fact that approved health claims will be allowed for use on all qualifying products. However,
a number of comments stressed that in a health claim, the role of the total diet should be emphasized rather than the
role of a specific food in risk reduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act pertains to a claim about the relationship between a nutrient and
a disease or health-related condition, rather than about particular food product and such a condition. While the
agency has used the term ``substance'' in lieu of the word ``nutrient'' and has said that a ``substance'' can be a food,
in doing so the agency was only trying to cover circumstances such as those presented by fruits, vegetables, and grain
products in which it was not possible to identify the specific nutrient in a broad class of foods that was having the
observed effect on the risk of disease. FDA was not thereby including formulated products as possible subjects of
health claims. Such products are formulated to include particular substances because of the nutritional effects
of those substances. Thus, a health claim for such a product would appropriately be about the substance in the formulated
product and not about the product itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 403(r)(3)(B)(iii) of the act directs the agency to require that health claims enable the public
to understand the information in the context of the total daily diet. As explained above, FDA finds that to effect Congress'
intent in passing the 1990 amendments, the same requirement should apply to health claims made on dietary supplements.
FDA believes that a claim that refers specifically to the effects on a disease or health-related condition resulting
from the consumption of a certain brand name of product would unduly emphasize the importance of that product and not
the importance of the total daily diet. Also, such claims could imply that other brands of the same food, as well as other
foods containing the substance that is the subject of the claim, might not have the same effect on the disease or health-related
condition and thus would be misleading under section 403(a) of the act. Accordingly, the agency finds that it is not
appropriate to approve product-specific health claims.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30. One comment suggested that FDA provide regular monthly or quarterly reports concerning newly approved health
claim petitions for display in the supplement section of stores. The comment maintained that such a list distributed
by FDA would increase consumer confidence in the claims when they appear on supplement labels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although FDA recognizes that there could be benefits to consumers from such reports, the agency simply does not have
the resources to provide the reports on an ongoing basis. However, FDA expects that trade associations and other interested
parties will provide information to firms that will ultimately be passed on to consumers.

31. Several comments raised concerns that the regulations violate the First Amendment. Comments cautioned that
the regulations would be unconstitutional if they limited the dissemination of scientific opinion or prevented
scientifically valid, well-balanced information from reaching the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule on health claims for foods in conventional food form, 58 FR 2478 at 2524 through 2528 (January 6, 1993),
the agency addressed in detail the First Amendment implications of its regulation of health claims on the food label
and in food labeling. The agency concluded that its regulations, and the act as amended by the 1990 amendments, do not
violate the First Amendment. FDA considers its earlier analysis to be relevant to the present rulemaking and incorporates
it into this document. The agency notes that none of the comments submitted on the proposed rule on health claims for
dietary supplements disputed the agency's earlier discussion, and no comments argued that subsequent court decisions
have called the agency's conclusions into question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comments that asserted that these regulations unconstitutionally suppress scientific opinion.
The regulations address what may appear in labeling; they do not affect any other means of disseminating information.
Indeed, far from limiting the dispersal of scientific information, as stated above, these regulations, which implement
the 1990 amendments to the act, permit more information to appear on the label than the act allowed before its amendment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency does not agree with the comments' implication that the Constitution requires a more lenient standard of
scientific validity than that codified in &sect;101.14(c). FDA has a strong interest in ensuring that the information
that appears on the food label is scientifically valid and believes that the standard it has adopted best furthers
that interest. When FDA seeks to ensure that food is not misbranded, it may place restrictions on label contents. See

31a. One comment asserted that health claims are not commercial in nature and are entitled to full First Amendment
protection. This comment described health claims as typically being mere recitations of scientific findings made
by independent medical authorities and backed by substantial agreement in the medical community. The comment asserted
that the proposed regulations reach ``pure scientific speech'' placed on labels and in product advertisements and
violate the First Amendment by: (1) denying speakers channels of communication to present truthful, nonmisleading
health claims; (2) denying speakers the right to communicate a particular kind of content; (3) discriminating against
certain speakers and forms of communication; and (4) denying the constitutional rights of willing listeners, viewers,
and readers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment. The agency notes initially that the comment misinterprets the scope of the agency's
action. These regulations apply only to health claims made on the label or in labeling of dietary supplements and not
to advertising.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency disagrees that health claims are entitled to full First Amendment protection. The agency has stated that,
although it does not consider it necessary for its First Amendment analysis to determine whether or not food labeling
fits the definition of commercial speech, labeling should certainly be considered closer to commercial speech than
to ``pure'' speech (58 FR 2478 at 2525 through 2526). It has also stated that ``[l]abeling statements on food products
intended for sale would clearly appear in the context of a commercial transaction and would `propose' such a transaction.''

on the food label to be ``pure'' speech. Contrary to the comment's assertion, information that is placed on the label

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the agency disagrees that health claims should be considered noncommercial speech, and although many of
the cases cited in the comment deal with fully protected speech rather than commercial speech and thus do not provide
a useful analytical framework for these regulations, the agency will address the comment's arguments individually.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency disagrees that its action denies speakers channels of communication. As discussed above, the agency has
placed no limits on the dissemination of scientific information but has acted to permit certain information to appear
on the label or in labeling of dietary supplements. Adequate alternative channels remain for the dissemination of
scientific information. For example, regulation of the information that may appear on the food label in no way affects
the ability of a scientist to publish experimental results in a journal. Moreover, any interested person may petition
for a health claim regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency disagrees that these regulations should be subjected to the close scrutiny afforded restraints on the
content of pure speech. Of the cases cited by the comment to advance this argument, one is particularly instructive.

, the court declined to apply strict scrutiny to the ``must-carry'' provisions of the 1992 Cable Act, applying instead
the ``interest-balancing traditionally applied to content-neutral speech regulation or legislation ostensibly
unrelated to expression that is discovered to impose incidental burdens on speech.'' 819 F. Supp. 32, 39 (D.D.C. 1993),

order upon a market in dysfunction, but a market in a commercial commodity nevertheless; not a market in speech'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. at 40). Similarly, with the 1990 amendments Congress sought to bring order to the food market. (See, e.g., 136 Congressional
Record S16611 (October 24, 1990) (statement of Sen. Hatch) (``It is up to us to make order out of chaos in the regulation
of food * * *.''); 136 Congressional Record H12953 (October 26, 1990) (statement of Rep. Waxman) (``[T]he bill will
once and for all settle the confusion surrounding health claims.'')). As discussed in the final rule on health claims
for foods in conventional food form, the case law establishes that FDA's power to regulate the food label derives from
its broad regulatory powers over food (58 FR 2525). As in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment argued that the regulations are impermissibly discriminatory because they require government regulators
to exercise judgment based on subjective line-drawing, guided not by rational principles of law and science but by
the will of the censorship authority. FDA disagrees. The agency has carefully articulated the appropriate scientific
standard that it will apply to proposed health claims. Unlike the ordinance at issue in

, cited by the comment, the decision whether to authorize a health claim is not left to the agency's whim but is based
on objective factors. 112 S. Ct. 2395, 2403 (1992). In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Forsyth
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the county administrator's exercise of discretion to vary the fee for assembling or parading was not reviewable
and did not require an explanation (Id). FDA's procedure for evaluating a proposed health claim, including use of
notice and comment rulemaking, presents a far different situation, and one that does not offend the Constitution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the comment's assertion, the fact that FDA does not presume to prohibit the publication of health claims
in the popular media does not show an ``arbitrary predilection to enforce [the] law against particular speakers and
forum owners rather than others.'' FDA has no interest in regulating the dissemination of scientific information
in the popular media and has no authority to do so. Rather, its strong interest is in ensuring that health claims made
in labeling, on which consumers are likely to rely when making purchasing decisions, are truthful, not misleading,
and scientifically valid. The agency's action contrasts with the categorical ban on commercial newsracks struck
down in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Discovery Network, Inc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 113 S. Ct. 1505. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the restriction, which was intended to advance Cincinnati's
interest in safety and esthetics, overemphasized the distinction between commercial and noncommercial speech
by prohibiting only newsracks holding commercial handbills and not those holding ordinary newspapers (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Id
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. at 1514). The city thus discriminated against a use of newsracks that was no more harmful to safety and esthetics than
the use it permitted (Id. at 1511). On the other hand, FDA's regulation of health claims in labeling bears a specific
relationship to the interests the agency has asserted, because it is directed specifically at ensuring the reliability
and validity of these claims (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
id
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. at 1514.) Contrary to the comment's assertion, the limited scope of FDA's regulations_i.e., food labeling_does
not amount to discrimination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the agency disagrees that its regulations deny the constitutional rights of willing listeners, viewers,
and readers. First, this argument overstates the impact of these regulations, which will affect only the labeling
of dietary supplements and not other sources of information about these products. Second, these regulations will
actually advance consumers' First Amendment interest in obtaining information on which to base a purchasing decision,
``by insuring that the information is not false or deceptive'' (

31b. Two comments asserted that, if health claims on labels are considered commercial speech, FDA's regulations
violate the First Amendment because they are more restrictive than necessary to achieve the government's goals.
One comment recognized that FDA has ``a great interest in preventing false and misleading claims and in preventing
fraud in the marketplace,'' but argued that closing the door on truthful, qualified claims that are based on significant
scientific evidence is not reasonably responsive to those interests. The other comment asserted that the wholesale
suppression of truthful, nonmisleading speech carries with it the silencing of speech indispensable to the health
of the American people, and that the agency's action not only lacks a rational relationship to the end chosen, public
health, but actually undercuts that goal by shrouding the public in ignorance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments do not dispute the government's substantial interest in promoting public health by ensuring that consumers
have access to information about dietary supplements that is scientifically valid, truthful, reliable, informative,
and not misleading. (Indeed, one comment stated that the government's interest is ``great.'') Rather, the comments
focus on the last two parts of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 test: whether the regulations directly advance the governmental interest, and whether there is a reasonable fit
between regulatory ends and means. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees that its regulations will undercut its stated goals. Rather, the regulations directly advance the
governmental interest. The regulations provide for FDA review of the relevant scientific evidence on a proposed
health claim before the agency decides whether to authorize use of the claim. In this way, the regulations ensure that
health claims are scientifically valid and reliable, and that they will not mislead consumers. At the same time, the
regulatory scheme encourages the provision of information to consumers that will enable them to maintain healthful
dietary practices. Thus, these regulations advance the government's interest in a ``direct and material way'' (Edenfield
v. Fane, 113 S. Ct. 1792, 1798 (1993)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also disagrees that these regulations are more extensive than necessary to serve the government interest. Recently,
the Supreme Court stated that the ``commercial speech cases require a fit between the restriction and the government
interest that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable'' (

The activity prohibited under the act and these regulations_marketing dietary supplements bearing unapproved
health claims in their labeling_constitutes a ``core of easily identifiable and constitutionally proscribable
conduct,'' (467 U.S. at 965&hyph;966). Labeling is defined in the act and easily identifiable. See 21 U.S.C. 321(m)
(``The term labeling means all labels and other written, printed, or graphic matter (1) upon any article or any of its
containers or wrappers, or (2) accompanying such article.''). Moreover, courts have held that misbranding food
is not protected under the First Amendment. See, e.g.,

In any event, it is doubtful that the overbreadth doctrine would apply to these regulations, particularly if they
are considered to regulate commercial speech, because the overbreadth doctrine does not apply to commercial speech.

more traditionally recognized forms of speech, such as political discourse.''

B. Fifth Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
32. One comment asserted that the takings clause of the United States Constitution provides protection to dietary
supplement trade names. It argued that &sect;101.14 might proscribe certain trade names that FDA has allowed to remain
on the market for years. The comment urged FDA to give more attention, under Executive Order 12630, to the regulation's
possible takings implications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When it issued its final regulations governing conventional foods under the 1990 amendments, FDA fully discussed
the takings implications of those regulations. (See 58 FR at 2397 through 2400 and 2528 through 2529). This discussion,
including the underlying takings analysis, is incorporated herein. The agency concluded that there would be no regulatory
taking under the Fifth Amendment if a manufacturer is required to alter its brand name when the brand name asserts by
implication a relationship between the presence or level of a substance in the food and a disease or health-related
condition, and that relationship is not the subject of an approved health claim (58 FR at 2529). Because the agency
conducted its analysis before passage of the DS act, it fully took into account the regulations' impact on dietary
supplements. Although the comment stated that FDA must address the issues raised by its regulations in light of Executive
Order 12630, it did not provide any additional information that the agency has not already considered. Therefore,
the agency concludes that it is not necessary to address potential takings issues in any greater detail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Other Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
33. A few comments objected to the period of time provided for public comment on the proposal, stating that it was too
short. One of these comments asserted that FDA had no reason to establish such a short deadline other than to curtail
public input on the proposed regulations. Another of these comments requested that FDA extend the period for public
comment on the proposed regulations to give consumer advocacy groups, health care professionals, and the scientific
community adequate time to prepare the information and opinions needed to fairly resolve the issues associated with
the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the preamble of the proposals, the DS act requires that final rules implementing the 1990 amendments
with respect to dietary supplements be issued by December 31, 1993. To meet this statutory timeframe, FDA was forced
to limit the comment period for the proposed regulations to 60 days. Thus, the agency reaffirms that it is unable to
grant any extensions to the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34. One comment requested that FDA clarify that the compliance date is the date on which manufacturers of dietary supplements
must begin to label products in accordance with &sect;101.14.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA advises that the comment is correct. Section 10(a)(2) of the 1990 amendments specifically states that ``* * * section
403(r) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act * * * shall not apply to food 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
which was labeled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
before the effective date of the amendments * * * [emphasis added].'' Accordingly, the effective date of the health
claims regulations for dietary supplements adopted by the agency under section 403(r) refers to the date on which
a dietary supplement is labeled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
35. A number of comments concerned the requirement in &sect;101.14(d)(2)(iv) that states that all claims must appear
in one place, in the same type size, without intervening material. The comments addressed the exception in this provision
that a short reference statement may appear on the label, ``See ______ for information about the relationship between
______ and ______,'' with the blanks filled in with references to the location of the labeling on which the full claim
appears, the name of the substance, and the disease or health-related condition. The comment requested that FDA allow
graphic material constituting an implied health claim to appear on the PDP without the accompanying referral statement
or full health claim, as long as the graphic material appeared in conjunction with the full health claim elsewhere
on the labeling. The comment justified this request based on the lack of sufficient label space on the PDP for the referral
statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not believe that it should make the requested revision in &sect;101.14(d)(2)(iv). In situations where graphic
material constitutes an implied health claim, and the reference statement is not present, the graphic material on
the labeling is in fact a shortened form of the health claim. FDA explained in response to comment 69 in the health claims
final rule that shortened health claims are misleading because they do not include facts that are material in light
of the representation that is made and that are necessary to understand the claim in the context of the daily diet.

IV. Impact Statements

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its dietary supplement labeling proposals pertaining to health claims, nutrition labeling, and nutrient content
claims in the June 18, 1993 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 33700, 33715, and 33731), FDA stated that the proposed rules on the labeling of dietary supplements, taken as
a whole, would have associated costs of approximately $20 million. Thus, the agency concluded that the proposed rules
do not constitute a major rule as defined by Executive Order 12291. In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354), FDA explored whether the proposed rules may have a significant impact on small businesses
and tentatively concluded that they do not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has evaluated many comments that it received in response to its economic impact analysis. Because the issues raised
in the comments relate to all three proposals, FDA has combined its discussion of these comments and presented them
in the final rule regarding the establishment of the date of application published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has examined the economic implications of the final rules as required by Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of
available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize
net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, and public health and safety effects; distributive
impacts; and equity). The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that the agency analyze the options for regulatory
relief for small businesses. FDA has concluded, based on its review of the available data and comments, that these
final rules are not significant as that term is defined by Executive Order 12866. Further, in accordance with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that these final rules will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small businesses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has previously considered the environmental effects of this rule when it was part of the proposed rule pertaining
to both foods in conventional food form and dietary supplements (November 27, 1991 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 60537 at 60562)). At that time, FDA determined under &sect;25.24(a)(8) and (11) that the proposed action was
of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant impact on the human environment. No new information
or comments have been received with respect to health claims for dietary supplements that would affect the agency's
previous determination that there is no significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact
statement is not required.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the dietary supplement proposal of June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33700 at 33714), FDA announced that the agency had submitted
to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for its review the collection of information requirements contained
in proposed &sect;101.70, for petitions regarding the use of health claims in conjunction with food labeling on dietary
supplements. Also in that document, FDA published its estimated annual collection of information burden for this
provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
None of the more than 1,200 comments received in response to the dietary supplement proposal addressed the content
of petitions under the proposed health claim petition requirements. Thus, the agency's estimate of the annual reporting
and recordkeeping burden from the health claim petition requirements contained in this final rule remains unchanged
from the estimate that it announced in June 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has submitted copies of the final rule to OMB for its review of these reporting requirements.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that, in accordance with the Nutrition Labeling and Education
Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments), as amended by the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 (the DS act), the regulation proposed
on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53254), to authorize the use of a health claim about the relationship between folate and the
risk of neural tube defects (NTD's) is now considered a final regulation for dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals,
herbs, and other similar nutritional substances (dietary supplements). The proposed regulation set out the information
that must be included in such a health claim to ensure that it is an accurate representation of the effect of intake of
folic acid on the risk of NTD's, and that any claims that are made are understandable, informative, and not misleading.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FDA is announcing that, in accordance with section 3(b)(1)(A)(ii), (b)(1)(A)(x), and (b)(2) of the 1990 amendments
as amended by the DS act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;571), the regulation proposed on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53254), to authorize
the use of a health claim about the relationship between folate and the risk of NTD's is now considered a final regulation
for dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other similar nutritional substances (dietary supplements).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
II. Passage of 1990 Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The 1990 amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535) gave the Secretary
of Health and Human Services (the Secretary), and by delegation FDA, the authority to issue regulations authorizing
health claims on the labels and in the labeling of foods. Section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(B))
provides that a product is misbranded if it bears a claim that characterizes the relationship of a nutrient to a disease
or health-related condition, unless the claim is made in accordance with procedures and standards established under
section 403(r)(3) and (r)(5)(D) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(3) and (r)(5)(D)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 amendments also directed the Secretary to determine through rulemaking whether claims regarding 10 nutrient-disease
relationships met the requirements of the act. The relationship of folic acid and NTD's was among those 10 topics (section
3(b)(1)(A)(x) of the 1990 amendments).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. The 1991 Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60537), FDA proposed to not authorize a health claim on folic acid and NTD's. The agency tentatively
concluded that the available evidence did not establish that the standard that FDA had proposed for health claims
for dietary supplements under section 403(r)(5)(D) of the act was met, that is, that there was not significant scientific
agreement, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence, that the claim is valid.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The Public Health Service Recommendations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In September 1992, the Public Health Service (PHS) issued a recommendation that all women of childbearing age in the
United States who are capable of becoming pregnant should consume 0.4 milligram (mg) of folic acid/day for the purpose
of reducing their risk of having a pregnancy affected with spina bifida or other NTD's. The recommendation was based
on data suggesting that folic acid, when given at a high dose (4 mg), can reduce the risk of recurrence of NTD's and on
a synthesis of information from studies that used multivitamins containing folic acid at dose levels from 0 to 1,000
micrograms/day. The PHS recommendation identified approaches and identified outstanding issues, including the
appropriate intake of folate, the potential role of other nutrients in reduction of risk of NTD's, safety concerns,
and the ``folate-preventable'' fraction of NTD's.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. The Dietary Supplement Act of 1992
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In October 1992, the DS act was enacted. This statute imposed a moratorium on FDA's implementation of the 1990 amendments
with respect to dietary supplements until December 15, 1993. The DS act directed FDA to issue proposed rules to implement
the 1990 amendments with respect to dietary supplements by June 15, 1993, and to issue final rules based on these proposals
by December 31, 1993. The DS act also amended the so-called ``hammer'' provision of the 1990 amendments, section 3(b)(2)
of the 1990 amendments, to provide that if the agency did not meet the established December 31, 1993, timeframe for
issuance of final rules, the proposed regulations would be considered final regulations.

D. The 1993 Final Rules for Health Claims for Foods in Conventional Food Form
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2606), FDA published a final rule to not authorize a health claim for folic acid and NTD's. However,
the agency reaffirmed its support of the PHS recommendation that all women of childbearing age in the United States
who are capable of becoming pregnant should consume 0.4 mg of folic acid daily to reduce their risk of having a pregnancy
affected with spina bifida or other NTD's. The agency noted, however, that unresolved questions about the safe use
of folate remained. The agency concluded that it could not authorize a health claim until these questions were resolved.
Because of the DS act, FDA took no final action with respect to the use of a health claim on folic acid and NTD's on dietary
supplements.

E. The 1993 Proposal to Authorize a Health Claim on Folic Acid and NTD's
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 14, 1993, FDA published a proposed rule to authorize the use of a health claim about the relationship of folate
and NTD's on the labels of foods in conventional food form and dietary supplements (58 FR 53254). FDA provided 60 days
for comment on this proposed action. The comment period closed on December 13, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3(b)(2) of the 1990 amendments, as amended by section 202(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the DS act, provides that if the
Secretary does not promulgate final regulations on any of the health claims applicable to dietary supplements in
a timely manner, the proposed regulations shall be considered final regulations but not until December 31, 1993.
FDA did not issue a final regulation on the use of a health claim on folic acid and NTD's on dietary supplements by December
31, 1993. Therefore, FDA is issuing this document announcing that by operation of the law, the proposal to authorize
a health claim about the relationship of folate and NTD's published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 14, 1993, is now considered a final regulation applicable to the labels and labeling of dietary supplements
only. The agency proposed that 21 CFR part 101 be amended as follows:

Relationship between folate and neural tube defects

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Neural tube defects are serious birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that can result in infant mortality or serious
disability. The birth defects anencephaly and spina bifida are the most common forms of neural tube defects and account
for about 90 percent of these defects. These defects result from failure of closure of the covering of the brain or spinal
cord during early embryonic development. Because the neural tube forms and closes during early pregnancy, the defect
may occur before a woman realizes that she is pregnant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Relationship
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The available data show that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. The strongest evidence
for this relationship comes from an intervention study by the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom that
showed that women at risk of recurrence of a neural tube defect pregnancy who consumed a supplement containing 4 milligrams
(mg) (4,000 micrograms (&mu;g)) folic acid daily had a reduced risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. (Products
that contain this level of folic acid are drugs.) In addition, based on its review of a Hungarian intervention trial
that used a multivitamin and multimineral preparation containing 800 &mu;g (0.8 mg) of folic acid, and its review
of the observational studies that reported use of multivitamins containing 0 to 1,000 &mu;g of folic acid, the Food
and Drug Administration concluded that most of these studies had results consistent with the conclusion that folate,
at levels attainable in usual diets, may reduce the risk of neural tube defects.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public health concern
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Neural tube defects occur in approximately 0.6 of 1,000 live births in the United States (i.e., about 2,500 cases
among 4 million live births annually). Neural tube defects are believed to be caused by many factors. The single greatest
risk factor for a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy is a personal or family history of a pregnancy affected with
a such a defect. However, about 90 percent of infants with a neural tube defect are born to women who do not have a family
history of these defects. The available evidence shows that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural
tube defects but not of other birth defects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Populations at risk
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Prevalence rates for neural tube defects have been reported to vary with a wide range of factors, including genetics,
geography, socioeconomic status, maternal birth cohort, month of conception, race, nutrition, and maternal health,
including maternal age and reproductive history. Women with a close relative (i.e., sibling, niece, nephew) with
a neural tube defect, those with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and women with seizure disorders who are being
treated with valproic acid or carbamazepine are at significantly increased risk compared with women without these
characteristics. Rates for neural tube defects vary within the United States, with lower rates observed on the west
coast than on the east coast.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Those who may benefit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Based on a synthesis of the results of several observational studies, the Public Health Service has estimated that
about 50 percent of neural tube defect-affected pregnancies in the United States (e.g., about 1,250) may be averted
annually if all women consume adequate amounts of folate daily (i.e., 0.4 mg) throughout their childbearing years.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The label or labeling of food in conventional food form or dietary supplements may contain a folate/neural tube defect
health claim provided that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The health claim for a food or supplement meets all of the general requirements of &sect;101.14 for health claims,
except that a food or dietary supplement may qualify to bear the health claim if it meets the definition of the term ``good
source.''

(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Women who consume adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, daily throughout their childbearing years may reduce
their risk of having a child with a neural tube birth defect. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious.
They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, dark green leafy vegetables
and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified cereals, or a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited
to 1,000 &mu;g per day from all sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Women who consume adequate amounts of folate daily throughout their childbearing years may reduce their risk of
having a child with a birth defect of the brain and spinal cord. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious.
They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, dark green
leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, fortified cereals, or a supplement. Women who have had a child
with a spinal cord birth defect should consult a physician before becoming pregnant. Folate consumption should be
limited to 1,000 &mu;g per day from all sources.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Women who take steps to ensure that their folate intake is adequate throughout their childbearing years may reduce
their risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. Such birth defects, while not widespread, are very serious.
They can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate, a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in citrus fruits
and juices, dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products such as breads, rice, and pasta, fortified
cereal, or a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 &mu;g per day from all sources.

(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Women who take steps to ensure that their folate intake is at least 400 &mu;g daily throughout their childbearing
years may reduce their risk of having a child with spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal
cord that, while not widespread, are very serious. These birth defects can have many causes. Adequate amounts of folate,
a B vitamin, can be obtained from diets rich in fruits, including citrus fruits and juices, vegetables, including
dark green leafy vegetables and legumes, enriched grain products, including breads, rice, and pasta, fortified
cereals, or from a supplement. Women who have had a pregnancy affected with a neural tube defect should consult a physician
before becoming pregnant. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 &mu;g per day from all sources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Some women who consume the Daily Value of folate (400 &mu;g) throughout their childbearing years may reduce their
risk of having a child affected with spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that, while
not widespread, are very serious. These birth defects can have many causes. Women of childbearing age should choose
well-balanced diets that include 2 to 4 servings per day of fruits (including citrus fruits and juices), 3 to 5 servings
of vegetables (including dark green leafy vegetables and legumes), 6 to 11 servings of enriched grain products (such
as breads, rice, and pasta) or fortified cereals throughout their childbearing years. Such diets provide many essential
minerals and vitamins, including folate. Women who may be concerned about their diets may choose to obtain folate
from a supplement. Folate consumption should be limited to 1,000 &mu;g per day from all sources.

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The agency notes that this document is part of a separate rulemaking contemplated by Congress if the final regulation
was not issued by December 31, 1993. This rulemaking bears a separate docket number from the one assigned to the October
14, 1993 rulemaking to distinguish it from that rulemaking, which is ongoing. The agency intends to continue its rulemaking
with respect to folic acid and neural tube defects and to issue a final rule as quickly as possible.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this regard, FDA recognizes that clarification with respect to the legal status of claims about folic acid and NTD's
on foods in conventional food form is appropriate. FDA advises that, given the PHS recommendation and the results
of FDA's preliminary review of the evidence on this claim, at this time it has no intention of taking action against
foods in conventional food form that are naturally high in folate that bear a claim on this nutrient-disease relationship,
so long as the claim fully complies with the provisions of the regulation that has become final for dietary supplements
by operation of law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, for foods fortified with folic acid, the agency has more significant concerns. As explained in the health
claim proposal on folic acid and NTD's (58 FR 53254 at 53288) and the proposal to amend the food additive regulation
on folic acid that published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53312), there appears to be a rather narrow range of safe use of folic acid in food. Based on
this tentative view, FDA would be very concerned, at least until it reached a final determination in those proceedings,
if manufacturers began adding folic acid to their products, or increasing the amount of folic acid in their products,
to qualify for a claim. Therefore, FDA strongly discourages the use of a health claim about folic acid and NTD's on any
such fortified products pending the issuance of a final rule on this nutrient-disease relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, FDA intends to issue a final rule in the proceeding on a health claim on folic acid and NTD's that it began
on October 14, 1993, in the near future. FDA is in the process of evaluating the comments that it has received in that
proceeding, including the results of an advisory committee meeting held on October 14 and 15. FDA will attempt to resolve
the issues in that ongoing proceeding as soon as possible.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that, in accordance with the Nutrition Labeling and Education
Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments), as amended by the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 (the DS act), the change in its regulations
that it proposed on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53296 through 53305), to reflect its tentative decision not to authorize
health claims relating an association between dietary fiber and cancer; dietary fiber and cardiovascular disease
(CVD); antioxidant vitamins and cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and coronary heart disease (CHD); and zinc and immune
deficiency in the elderly on the labels and in the labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and
other similar nutritional substances (dietary supplements) is now considered a final regulation.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
FDA is announcing that, in accordance with section 3(b)(1)(A)(ii), (b)(1)(A)(vi), (b)(1)(A)(x), and (b)(2) of
the 1990 amendments (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535), as amended by the DS act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;571), the change in its regulations
that it proposed on October 14, 1993 (58 FR 53296 through 53305), to reflect its tentative decision not to authorize
health claims relating an association between dietary fiber and cancer (Docket No. 93N&hyph;480F); dietary fiber
and CVD (Docket No. 93N&hyph;480C); antioxidant vitamins and cancer (Docket No. 93N&hyph;480A); omega-3 fatty
acids and CHD (Docket No. 93N&hyph;480O); and zinc and immune deficiency in the elderly (Docket No. 93N&hyph;480Z)
on the labels and in the labeling of dietary supplements is now considered a final regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
II. Passage of 1990 Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The 1990 amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) gave the Secretary of Health and Human Services
(the Secretary), and by delegation FDA, the authority to issue regulations authorizing health claims on the labels
and in the labeling of foods. Section 403(r)(1)(B) of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(B)) provides that a product is misbranded
if it bears a claim that characterizes the relationship of a nutrient to a disease or health-related condition, unless
the claim is made in accordance with procedures and standards established under section 403(r)(3) and (r)(5)(D)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(r)(3) and (r)(5)(D)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1990 amendments also directed the Secretary to determine through rulemaking whether claims regarding 10 nutrient-disease
relationships meet the requirements of the act. Dietary fiber and cancer, dietary fiber and CVD, antioxidant vitamins
and cancer, zinc and immune function in the elderly, and omega-3 fatty acids and CHD were among the topics that FDA was
directed to evaluate under section 3(b)(1)(A)(vi) and (b)(1)(A)(x) of the 1990 amendments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
III. The 1991 Health Claims Proposals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 27, 1991, FDA proposed not to authorize health claims on dietary fiber and CVD (56 FR 60582); dietary fiber
and cancer (56 FR 60566); antioxidant vitamins and cancer (56 FR 60624); zinc and immune function in the elderly (56
FR 60652); and omega-3 fatty acids and CHD (56 FR 60663). The agency tentatively concluded that the available evidence
did not establish that the standard that FDA had proposed for health claims for dietary supplements under section
403(r)(5)(D) of the act was met, that is, the agency tentatively concluded that there was not significant scientific
agreement, based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence that these claims are valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. The Dietary Supplement Act of 1992
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In October 1992, the DS act was enacted. This statute imposed a moratorium on FDA's implementation of the 1990 amendments
with respect to dietary supplements until December 15, 1993 (although the DS act did provide that FDA could authorize
claims for dietary supplements before that date). The DS act directed FDA to issue proposed rules to implement the
1990 amendments with respect to dietary supplements by June 15, 1993, and to issue final rules based on these proposals
by December 31, 1993. The DS act also amended the so-called ``hammer'' provision of the 1990 amendments, section 3(b)(2)
of the 1990 amendments, to provide that if the agency did not meet the established December 31, 1993, timeframe for
issuance of final rules, the proposed regulations would be considered final regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. The 1993 Final Rules For Health Claims For Foods in Conventional Food Form
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 6, 1993, FDA published final rules on the general requirements for health claims on the labels and in the
labeling of foods in conventional food form (58 FR 2478), and final rules authorizing health claims on seven nutrient-disease
relationships (calcium and osteoporosis; fat and cancer; saturated fat and cholesterol and CHD; fiber-containing
grain products, fruits, and vegetables and cancer; fruits, vegetables, and grain products that contain fiber and
risk of CHD; and fruits and vegetables and cancer). Three of the health claims that FDA authorized were for fresh fruits
and vegetables and grains, and thus these claims were not authorized for dietary supplements. Because of the DS act,
FDA took no final action with respect to the use on dietary supplements of health claims on dietary fiber and cancer;
dietary fiber and CVD; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD; zinc and immune function in the elderly; and antioxidant vitamins
and cancer. (The agency's actions with respect to health claims involving folic acid and neural tube defects are described
in a notice published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. The 1993 Proposal to Not Authorize Health Claims For Dietary Supplements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 14, 1993, FDA published a proposal to not authorize health claims on the labels of dietary supplements on
five nutrient-disease relationships: Dietary fiber and cancer; dietary fiber and CVD; antioxidant vitamins and
cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD; and zinc and immune function in the elderly (58 FR 53296). FDA provided 60 days
for comment on this proposed action. Thus, the comment period closed on December 13, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3(b)(2) of the 1990 amendments, as amended by section 202(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the DS act, provides that if the
Secretary does not promulgate final regulations on any of the health claims applicable to dietary supplements in
a timely manner, the proposed regulations shall be considered final regulations but not until after December 31,
1993. FDA did not issue final regulations on the use of health claims on dietary supplements on dietary fiber and cancer;
dietary fiber and CVD; antioxidant vitamins and cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD; and zinc and immune function
in the elderly by December 31, 1993. Therefore, FDA is issuing this document announcing that by operation of law, the
change in its regulations that FDA proposed to reflect a decision not to authorize health claims about the relationships
of dietary fiber and cancer; dietary fiber and CVD; antioxidant vitamins and cancer; omega-3 fatty acids and CHD;
and zinc and immune function in the elderly, published in the October 14, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, is now considered a final regulation by operation of law. The agency proposed that 21 CFR part 101 be amended as follows:

PART 101_FOOD LABELING
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

2. Section 101.71 is amended by revising the introductory text to read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->

Health claims: claims not authorized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Health claims not authorized for foods in conventional food form or for dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals,
herbs, or other similar substances:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 -->
* * * * *
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1990 amendments state that FDA is to promptly publish notice of the new status of the proposed change in its regulations
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This notice is issued in response to that requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that this rulemaking constitutes a separate rulemaking from that instituted with respect to the
five nutrient-disease relationships on October 14, 1993. This separate rulemaking was contemplated by Congress
if a final rule was not issued by December 31, 1993. The agency notes, however, that the October 14, 1993, rulemaking
remains ongoing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, with regard to antioxidant vitamins and cancer, on November 1 through 3, 1993, FDA held a public conference
on this nutrient-disease relationship. (The conference also covered antioxidant vitamins and CVD.) The transcript
of that meeting has been submitted to the Docket as a comment, and other comments were solicited in the announcement
of the conference (58 FR 54595, October 22, 1993). FDA intends to consider all comments and data received at this conference.
FDA intends to take any actions that it concludes are warranted by this information either in the ongoing rulemaking
on an antioxidant vitamins and cancer claim for dietary supplements or, if the agency concludes that it is appropriate,
in a separate rulemaking.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS has determined that the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon should be reclassified from threatened
to endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). NMFS has determined that the current biological status
of the species is endangered based on the continued decline and increased variability of run sizes since its first
listing as a threatened species in 1989, the expectation of weak returns in certain years as the result of two small
year classes (1991 and 1993), and continuing threats to the population. Although measures implemented through consultations
conducted under section 7 of the ESA and State and Federal regulatory actions are designed to reduce adverse impacts
on the species, quantifiable improvements in population levels are not likely to be evident for several years. NMFS
will continue to closely monitor the status of this population, and evaluate the protective measures to determine
whether there is evidence that these measures have reduced or eliminated threats to the species and whether a change
in status may be warranted.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the ESA and its implementing regulations (50 CFR part 424), an ``endangered species'' is any species that is
in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A ``threatened species'' is any species
that is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion
of its range. Based on a review of the status of the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon and the factors affecting
the species, NMFS has determined that it is endangered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon is a unique population that is distinguishable from other chinook
salmon runs in the Sacramento River based on the timing of its upstream migration and spawning period. For the most
part, the winter-run chinook salmon population is comprised of three year classes, each of which primarily returns
to spawn as 3-year old fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The best available data on winter-run chinook salmon abundance are the annual estimates of the spawning run size made
by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) based on counts of fish passing the Red Bluff Diversion Dam. The
CDFG began estimating the annual run size for winter-run chinook salmon in 1967 after the Dam was placed in operation.
This time series of annual run size estimates has documented a precipitous decline in the winter-run chinook salmon
to its present low level (Table 1).

In 1989, the CDFG estimated that the winter-run chinook salmon run size was only 547 fish. This unexpectedly small
return represented nearly a 75 percent decline from the consistent, but low, run size of 2,000 to 3,000 fish that had
occurred since 1982. As a result of this unexpected decline, NMFS issued an emergency interim rule listing the winter-run
chinook salmon as threatened under the ESA on August 4, 1989 (54 FR 32085). During the period the emergency interim
rule was in effect, NMFS published a proposed rule to list winter-run chinook salmon as threatened under the formal
listing procedures of the ESA on March 20, 1990 (55 FR 10260). To avoid a hiatus in protection of the species until the
formal listing process was completed, NMFS published a second emergency interim rule listing winter-run chinook
salmon as threatened on April 2, 1990 (55 FR 12191). On November 5, 1990, NMFS completed the formal listing process
and published a final rule (55 FR 46515) listing the species as threatened under the ESA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 5, 1991, the American Fisheries Society petitioned NMFS to reclassify winter-run chinook salmon as an endangered
species. At the time the petition was submitted, the best preliminary data available indicated that the 1991 run would
consist of a return of only 88 to 200 adults from the progeny of the 1988 run of 2,085 fish. The final run size estimate
made by the CDFG for 1991 was 191 fish (Table 1). NMFS reviewed the petition and determined that it contained substantial
information indicating that the petitioned action might be warranted. On November 7, 1991, NMFS announced (56 FR
58986) its intention to review the status of the species to determine whether reclassification was appropriate.
After conducting a status review, NMFS published a proposed rule (57 FR 27416) on June 19, 1992, to reclassify winter-run
chinook salmon as endangered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS published a subsequent Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice (58 FR 31688) on June 4, 1993, delaying the issuance of a final determination on the reclassification for up
to six months pursuant to section 4(b)(6)(B) of the ESA. On September 10, 1993, NMFS published another 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice that provided information on the 1993 run size estimate (341 fish) and reopened the public comment period on
the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This determination does not change any of the prohibitions against taking Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon.
Section 9 of the ESA prohibits taking endangered species. The regulations issued when this species was listed as threatened
in November 1990 also prohibit taking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a separate rulemaking, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), which is responsible for the List of Endangered
and Threatened Wildlife, will revise the list to reflect the reclassification of this species from threatened to
endangered.

Current Status

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures were implemented by the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) beginning in 1986&hyph;1987 in an
effort to improve adult passage conditions for winter-run chinook salmon at Red Bluff Diversion Dam and to provide
suitable spawning and egg incubation conditions for the species in the upper Sacramento River below Keswick Dam.
Despite the implementation of measures in 1986&hyph;1987 and 1987&hyph;1988, the winter-run chinook salmon run
size declined to 441 fish in 1990 and to 191 fish in 1991. The estimated 1991 run size of 191 fish was primarily the result
of surviving progeny from the 1988 spawning population of 2,085 fish. Thus, the 1991 spawning escapement represented
nearly a 90 percent decline in a single generation, and suggested that the 1988 year class was nearly a total failure
(57 FR 27416).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1992, the CDFG estimated that the winter-run chinook salmon run size increased to 1,180 fish. This run size was substantially
higher than the runs estimated in 1989 (547 fish), 1990 (441 fish), and 1991 (191 fish), and it represented more than
a 100 percent increase in the spawning population in a single successive generation since the 1992 run was comprised
primarily of the surviving progeny from the 1989 run. In 1989, the Bureau implemented conservation measures to manage
upper Sacramento River water temperatures and provide improved fish passage at the Red Bluff. As a result of these
actions, temperature conditions were much improved with favorable water temperatures occurring from Keswick Dam
to Bend Bridge (44 miles downstream) during almost the entire spawning and egg incubation period. Spawning ground
surveys in 1989 also indicated that nearly 100 percent of the estimated run spawned in this 44-mile river reach where
water temperature was favorable. As a result of these factors, temperature-related mortality was minimal in 1989.
The substantial increase in the 1992 run size suggests that the measures implemented to protect winter-run chinook
salmon in 1989 were effective, and that similar or more protective measures may be successful in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1993, the CDFG estimated the winter-run chinook salmon run size to be 341 fish. This represented nearly a 30 percent
decline of the run size in one generation. NMFS had anticipated that the run size would likely decline in 1993 because
the 1990 spawning population (441 fish) experienced less favorable water temperature conditions during spawning
and egg incubation, and more of the run spawned downstream from the river reach where temperatures could be suitably
managed by the Bureau. In 1990, as a result of continued drought conditions and high ambient temperatures, favorable
water temperatures for spawning and egg incubation were present only from Keswick Dam to the Balls Ferry Bridge (26
miles downstream) during a portion of the egg incubation period. In addition, spawning distribution surveys indicated
that nearly 10 percent of the run spawned downstream from Balls Ferry where temperatures were not favorable. Therefore,
temperature-related mortality was substantially higher in 1990 than in 1989. In addition to less favorable temperature
conditions, it is possible that conditions for outmigrants were less than favorable, and that ocean survival of the
1990 year class was reduced by the El Nino event that began in 1991&hyph;92. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the winter-run chinook salmon was formally listed as threatened in November 1990 (55 FR 46515), the species
run size has continued to decline, with the exception of 1992, and exhibit considerable variability (Table 1). Although
some protective measures were implemented beginning in 1987, this decline was exacerbated by the 6-year drought
in California (1987&hyph;1992). Based on the run size estimates for the last 3 years (1991&hyph;1993), the population
now has two weak year classes (1991 and 1993). NMFS expects that the 1994 run will also be weak because of the weak 1991
year class (191 fish) and the less than favorable conditions for spawning, egg incubation, and juvenile outmigration
that occurred in 1991&hyph;92. Because of the small run in 1991 and the weak return expected in 1994, this year class
is likely to remain weakened for some time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the status review, extinction probabilities were estimated for the winter-run chinook salmon population
using modifications of the model described by Dennis, Munholland, and Scott (1991), and the 3-year geometric moving
average of the annual estimated run size for the periods of 1967&hyph;1993 and 1979 1993, respectively. Results of
the analysis indicate that if past trends continue, the population faces a high probability of dropping below 100
spawners per year at least once over the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 years, and to even lower levels over the 50 and 100 year time horizons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The extinction modeling results suggest that the risk of the winter-run chinook salmon population dropping to unacceptably
low levels is high. However, this type of analysis is based only on historical trends in the population (1967&hyph;1993)
and assumes that past conditions will continue in the future. Although the 1994 run is expected to be weak, NMFS believes
that conditions for winter-run chinook salmon were substantially improved in 1992 and 1993 because of long-term
protective measures implemented to reduce impacts of Central Valley and State Water Project operations and improve
conditions for successful egg incubation, rearing, and outmigration, and the end of the drought. In addition to these
protective measures, the FWS has been supplementing the natural production of juveniles with substantial numbers
of hatchery produced fish. If these protective measures and supplementation efforts prove to be effective, run sizes
in 1995 and 1996 will likely increase. For these reasons, the probability of the population declining to low levels
is probably less than suggested by the extinction modeling analysis. However, because the effectiveness of these
recently implemented protective measures and supplementation efforts is unknown and cannot be assessed until future
runs return, there remains substantial risk that the population is in danger of extinction.

Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The World Wildlife Fund supported the reclassification and also encouraged NMFS to develop and implement a recovery
plan for the conservation of Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon. The Department of the Interior (Interior)
also supported the reclassification of winter-run chinook salmon, and said the population remained at depressed
levels and may be in danger of extinction after the next two runs. However, Interior noted that the 1989 year class survived
particularly well and that the resulting 1992 run size of 1,180 adults represented more than a 100 percent increase
in size in a single successive generation. Interior also acknowledged that the 1992 increase in run size may indicate
that measures taken to protect the population in recent years may be effective. Interior also provided technical
comments to clarify and update facts contained in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Westlands Water District, the Family Water Alliance, and the Glenn County Board of Supervisors all opposed reclassifying
winter-run chinook salmon because of protective measures that have been recently implemented. They said that the
threatened status should be retained until the effectiveness of these measures has been assessed.

Response to Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS agrees with the World Wildlife Fund that development and implementation of a recovery plan is essential for the
conservation and recovery of winter-run chinook salmon. For this reason, NMFS has appointed a National Sacramento
River winter-run chinook salmon recovery team, comprised of fishery resource mangers, experts on winter-run chinook
salmon biology, and conservation biology specialists, to develop a recovery plan. The recovery team has been meeting
since September 1992 and will submit a draft recovery plan to NMFS in 1994. Interior's technical comments were incorporated
where appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS disagrees with the comments of the Westlands Water District, the Family Water Alliance, and the Glenn County
Board of Supervisors that current protective measures should be allowed to be in place for a certain amount of time
and their effectiveness evaluated before NMFS determines whether reclassification is necessary. Although measures
have been implemented to reduce adverse impacts on winter-run chinook salmon, and NMFS believes they are likely to
be effective, their effectiveness is currently unknown and cannot be evaluated until data on future returns are available.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the factors to be considered in listing, delisting and reclassifying a species is ``the inadequacy of existing
regulatory mechanisms.'' Judicial interpretation of this language allows NMFS to also consider the ``adequacy''
of regulatory mechanisms in its listing decisions. It is premature to determine the adequacy of these measures for
purposes of this reclassification. Most measures will not demonstrate positive results until the 1996 return of
adult winter-run chinook salmon. NMFS must determine whether reclassification is justified on the basis of the current
status of the population and the factors affecting its continued existence.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(1) of the ESA specifies five criteria to be evaluated in reviewing the status of a species or population
proposed for listing or reclassification. The following discussion is in addition to the evaluation of these factors
in the proposed rulemaking to reclassify winter-run chinook salmon as an endangered species (57 FR 27416, June 19,
1992), the first Notice of Determination (52 FR 6041, February 27, 1987), a subsequent Notice of Determination (53
FR 49722, December 19, 1987), two emergency rules (54 FR 32088, August 4, 1989 and 55 FR 12193, April 2, 1990), the proposed
rule to list winter-run chinook salmon as threatened (55 FR 10260, March 20, 1990), and the final rule listing the species
as threatened (55 FR 46515, November 5, 1990).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Modification and loss of spawning and rearing habitat have been major factors contributing to the decline of the winter-run
chinook salmon.

Shasta and Keswick Dams
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 12, 1993, NMFS issued a biological opinion and incidental take statement to the Bureau of Reclamation
which concluded that long-term operations of the Federal Central Valley Project and the State Water Project would
jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon. The opinion identifies a reasonable and prudent
alternative with measures designed to protect winter-run chinook salmon from the long-term operations of Shasta
and Keswick Dams, as well as other facilities of the Central Valley Project. Implementation of these measures is expected
to substantially improve water temperature and flow conditions in the upper Sacramento River for winter-run chinook
salmon spawning, incubation, and rearing. The specific measures contained in the reasonable and prudent alternative
that relate to Shasta and Keswick Dams require the Bureau to (1) use a more conservative forecasting approach to determine
the annual allocation of deliverable water stored in Shasta Reservoir, (2) maintain a minimum end-of-water-year
carryover storage in Shasta Reservoir (1.9 million acre-feet) for most water year types, (3) maintain daily average
water temperatures in the winter-run chinook salmon spawning grounds below Keswick Dam at no more than 56 degrees
Fahrenheit from April 15 through August 31 and at no more than 60 degrees Fahrenheit from October 1 through October
31, (4) maintain a minimum flow of 3,250 cubic feet per second (cfs) from Keswick Dam from October 1 through March 31,
and (5) reduce releases from Keswick Dam according to specific criteria from July 1 through March 31. The reasonable
and prudent alternative identified specific temperature control points in the upper Sacramento River for various
operating scenarios based on the water year type and reservoir storage conditions at the start of the water year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on forecasted water supplies and reservoir storage conditions in February and March 1993, the Bureau met the
reasonable and prudent alternative requirement to maintain water temperatures at or below 56 degrees Fahrenheit
throughout the entire winter-run chinook salmon spawning and incubation season from Keswick Dam to Bend Bridge.
The CDFG conducted numerous aerial surveys of redd (nests) counts during the winter-run chinook spawning period
and observed an unusually large number of redds (in proportion to the estimated run size) due to excellent viewing
conditions in the river. Based on these surveys, virtually all redds were observed in the vicinity of Redding well
upstream from Ball's Ferry. Two redds were observed between Ball's Ferry and the Bend Bridge temperature control
point, and only a single redd was observed below Bend Bridge (immediately downstream from the Red Bluff Diversion
Dam). As a result of the temperature control maintained by the Bureau and the distribution of spawners in the river,
the incremental impact of temperature on winter-run chinook salmon egg and juvenile survival was minimal in 1993.
In addition to providing temperature control during the 1993 spawning, incubation, and rearing season, the Bureau's
operations in 1993 resulted in an end-of-water-year Shasta Reservoir storage (in excess of 3.0 million acre-feet)
that far exceeded the requirements of the reasonable and prudent alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incidental take statement issued with the February 1993, long-term CVP biological opinion also contains specific
measures that must be implemented to minimize the effects of Shasta and Keswick Dam operations on winter-run chinook
salmon incidental take. These measures include (1) the continuation and expansion of temperature monitoring in
the upper Sacramento River to ensure compliance with the temperature criteria, (2) NMFS review of the Bureau's proposed
water allocation plans before delivery commitments are made each year to determine their potential effects on upper
river water temperatures, and (3) monitoring in the upper river when Keswick Dam releases are reduced to prevent the
stranding of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon. These measures were implemented by the Bureau as required by the
incidental take statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spawning habitat utilized by winter-run chinook salmon in the Sacramento River has also been degraded by decreases
in the rate of replenishment for gravel suitable for spawning (NMFS 1992c). In 1990, the California Department of
Water Resources placed 100,000 cubic yards of spawning gravel in the upper Sacramento River between Salt Creek and
Clear Creek to restore degraded spawning riffles in areas of the river used by winter-run chinook salmon. The FWS has
been evaluating these gravel restoration efforts and issued progress reports in 1992 and 1993. Thus far, the majority
of the gravel remains where it was originally placed because flows have not reached rates great enough to disperse
it in the upper river. Studies by the FWS are expected to continue through at least 1993 with a final report on the program
expected in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adult winter-run chinook salmon can also be adversely impacted by operation of the Keswick Dam stilling basin. Overflow
of water from the stilling basin during operation of the spillway attracts upstream migrating adult salmon into the
basin at the base of the Dam where they become trapped. The CDFG and FWS have conducted fish rescue operations at the
stilling basin and removed hundreds of trapped salmon. Until the facility is structurally modified to allow fish
free passage back to the river, it is likely that some adult winter-run chinook salmon will be lost. To remedy this long-standing
problem, the incidental take statement issued with NMFS' February 12, 1993, biological opinion requires the Bureau
to structurally modify the stilling basin by no later than December 31, 1993, so that adult winter-run chinook salmon
will be able to freely pass from the basin back into the Sacramento River. NMFS and the Bureau have been meeting to discuss
and evaluate alternative methods of correcting the problems with the stilling basin.

Red Bluff Diversion Dam
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another serious habitat concern for winter-run chinook salmon is the impediment to adult upstream migration caused
by the Bureau's operation of this dam on the Sacramento River. Operation of the dam and the associated Tehama-Colusa
Canal also adversely impacts juvenile winter-run chinook salmon migrating downstream past the facility. Impacts
of the dam and its operations are discussed in the February 12, 1993, biological opinion addressing long-term operations
of the Central Valley and State Water Projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 biological opinion also includes specific measures to minimize the impact of gate operations at Red Bluff
Diversion Dam on both the upstream passage of adult winter-run chinook salmon and the downstream passage of juveniles.
These measures require the Bureau to maintain the dam gates in the raised position at least through April 30, 1993,
and from November 1, 1993, through at least April 30, 1994. After the Bureau's proposed pilot pumping project is operational
in 1994, the Bureau must raise the dam gates from September 15 through at least May 14 in all subsequent years. Operation
of dam gates in accordance with this schedule is expected to provide unimpeded access to upper river spawning habitat
for most migrating adults and substantially reduce losses of downstream migrating juveniles due to predation. The
Bureau maintained the dam gates in the raised position through April 30, 1993. In a effort to provide additional protection
for outmigrating juveniles in 1993, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau raised the dam gates in mid-October rather than on November 1 as required by the reasonable and prudent alternative.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Operation of the Tehama-Colusa Canal water diversion facilities associated with Red Bluff Diversion Dam before
1990 also adversely affected juvenile winter-run chinook salmon during their outmigration. To improve operation
of the dam and canal and to reduce impacts to juvenile salmonids, including winter-run chinook salmon, the Bureau
installed ``state-of-the-art'' drum screens and a bypass system at the canal headworks in 1990. Studies conducted
to date indicate that the entrainment problem has been greatly diminished by the new screens. FWS is expected to publish
a report in 1993 summarizing the results of monitoring and evaluation studies conducted in 1992. Additional studies,
including monitoring of entrainment and an evaluation of mortality associated with the bypass system is anticipated
in 1993. The February 1993 biological opinion for long-term CVP operations requires the Bureau to develop and implement
a program to evaluate the fish bypass facilities, and correct any identified problems. This evaluation has not been
completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau, in conjunction with Federal and state fishery agencies, has been evaluating various alternatives to
the existing facilities at Red Bluff Diversion Dam. The Bureau published an appraisal report in 1992 that identified
and analyzed several alternatives for improving fish passage at the dam. Among the four most reasonable alternatives
identified in the appraisal report, two involve installation of a new pumping plant based on the Archimedes screw
design. The Bureau has postponed final selection of a preferred alternative until experimental data are collected
and analyzed from a pilot pumping plant that will be constructed downstream from the dam in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pilot pumping plant that the Bureau has proposed to install at the dam will consist of three large pumps to be located
on the west bank of the Sacramento River immediately downstream from the dam. Two of the pumps will be closed Archimedes
pumps and the third will be a helical style pump, with each having approximately a 100 cfs capacity. This pilot program
is intended to evaluate the pump design and operation, and to allow the Bureau to meet irrigation demands in the Tehama-Colusa
Canal service area while maintaining the dam gates in the raised position. NMFS conducted an ESA section 7 consultation
with the Bureau on the pilot pumping project and issued a biological opinion and incidental take statement in February
1993 which requires the Bureau to conduct an extensive monitoring program to evaluate the effects of fish passage
by the pumps and assess the level of taking. Consultation was reinitiated in June 1993 to address modifications in
the design, construction, and operations of the pumping facility that would delay eventual operation from October
1993 to December 1994.

Pollution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pollution in the Sacramento River has also degraded winter-run chinook salmon spawning and rearing habitat. In particular,
NMFS is concerned about the effects on adult and juvenile winter-run chinook salmon from runoff entering the upper
Sacramento River that is contaminated by heavy metals leached from inactive mining sites at Iron Mountain Mine (IMM).
Heavy metal concentrations from this runoff can reach levels that are lethal to winter-run chinook salmon eggs and
juveniles. Metal-laden runoff that flows from IMM into the Spring Creek drainage is impounded behind the Spring Creek
Debris Dam operated by the Bureau. The Bureau generally operates this dam to control the release of contaminated Spring
Creek flow in conjunction with dilution releases from Shasta and Whiskeytown Reservoirs. The Bureau is expected
to continue controlling releases from Spring Creek Debris Dam in this manner until source control and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleanup can be achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has placed IMM on the Superfund Priority List, and the State of California
and EPA are continuing to evaluate options for the long-term control of contaminants originating from the IMM complex.
Based on an memorandum of Agreement between the Bureau and EPA, the Bureau will develop a plan to enlarge Spring Creek
Debris Dam to provide additional storage for IMM effluent. EPA also issued a Record of Decision on September 30, 1992,
identifying an interim remedial action plan to clean up hazardous substances in the Boulder Creek Operable Unit at
the IMM site. The remedial action involves the collection and treatment of acid mine drainage discharges from the
Richmond and Lawson portals at IMM, and the excavation and capping of existing waste piles that are eroding and discharging
into Boulder Creek and subsequently Spring Creek and the upper Sacramento River. The Richmond and Lawson portals
are the two largest sources of hazardous materials at the IMM site and represent the sources for nearly 40 percent of
the copper and 80 percent of the cadmium and zinc leached from IMM and discharged into tributaries leading to the Sacramento
River. In addition to these activities, the EPA is moving forward with plans to study several remaining sources of
contamination at IMM and identify appropriate remedial actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 biological opinion to the Bureau also addressed contamination from IMM. The opinion's incidental take statement
requires the Bureau to operate Spring Creek Debris Dam and Shasta Dam so as to minimize the chronic exposure of adult
and juvenile winter-run chinook salmon to heavy metal concentrations and eliminate the potential scouring of metal
laden sediments from Keswick Reservoir.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS has previously expressed concern that outmigrating juvenile winter-run chinook salmon may be adversely impacted
by the disposal of contaminated dredge sediments at disposal sites located in the San Francisco Bay area. The residence
time for outmigrating winter-run chinook salmon through the Bay is thought to range from 1 week to more than 2 months
depending on the water year type. Prey organisms utilized by juvenile winter-run chinook salmon may bioaccumulate
contaminants originating from in-bay disposal of contaminated dredge sediments, thereby exposing juveniles to
these contaminants as they forage and migrate through the Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although NMFS continues to be concerned about the potential effects of in-bay disposal, the Corps has taken recent
action to ensure that in-bay disposal of contaminated materials does not occur. In June 1992, the Corps, EPA, the Regional
Water Quality Control Board, and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission published proposed
interim testing guidelines for dredged sediments that would be disposed of at in-bay sites. On February 1, 1993, the
Corps formally adopted these guidelines in Public Notice 93&hyph;2. These interim testing guidelines are designed
to ensure that sufficient information is available to characterize sediments to be dredged for all projects so that
disposal does not result in chemical or biological degradation of the disposal site. These guidelines are intended
to apply to all open water disposal projects until a long-term plan for managing dredged sediments in the San Francisco
Bay area is developed and implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the interim testing guidelines adopted by the Corps represent an important short-term action aimed at preventing
the in-bay disposal of contaminated sediments, NMFS believes it is essential that a long-term strategy be developed
and implemented for San Francisco Bay area dredging and disposal activities. To meet this need, the Corps and several
other Federal, state and local agencies, including NMFS, are developing a Long-Term Management Strategy (LTMS)
for managing dredging and disposal activities. The LTMS is designed to provide appropriate dredged material disposal
alternatives for a 50-year planning horizon through the designation of ocean, in-bay, and upland disposal sites
and the identification of beneficial reuse options. Implementation of the LTMS management programs is anticipated
to begin in August 1994.

Bank Stabilization

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Bank stabilization projects in the Sacramento River are believed to adversely affect winter-run chinook salmon
rearing habitat. The Corp of Engineers has developed the Sacramento River Bank Protection Project as a long-range
program for construction of bank erosion control works. On October 28, 1991, NMFS issued a biological opinion to the
Corps that concluded Phase II of the project was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook
salmon. However, the incidental take statement issued with the opinion requires the Corps to select the least damaging
bank stabilization methods available and to provide NMFS with detailed mitigation plans for each bank protection
project in Phase II that would adversely affect winter-run chinook salmon habitat. Based on recent information developed
by the FWS concerning bank protection methods that minimize impacts and the importance of protecting shaded riverine
aquatic habitat, NMFS requested the Corps to reinitiate consultation on Phase II of the project in late 1992. The Corps
is currently developing additional environmental documentation for the remaining Phase II bank protection projects,
and NMFS anticipates that further consultation will be initiated when that documentation is completed.

In 1991, NMFS consulted with the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) pursuant to section 7 of the ESA to evaluate
the potential effects of the proposed Pacific Ocean Salmon Fishery Management Plan (FMP) on winter-run chinook salmon.
A biological opinion was issued to the PFMC on March 1, 1991, that concluded management of the salmon fishery under
the Pacific Ocean Salmon FMP was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon. An
incidental take statement was also issued with the opinion that authorized a limited incidental take of winter-run
chinook salmon by the ocean fishery (NMFS 1991b). NMFS has also consulted with the Council concerning implementation
of Amendment 4 to the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP. The opinion issued by NMFS concluded that implementation of the
FMP would not jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon as a result of incidental bycatch of
salmon in the fishery. NMFS will continue to consult internally and with the PFMC, as appropriate, to ensure that ocean
salmon and other fishery management actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1987, the CDFG has implemented seasonal fishing closures in the upper Sacramento River and monitored the recreational
salmon catch. In 1990, the California Fish and Game Commission adopted regulations that prohibited the retention
of salmon in the Sacramento River when adult winter-run chinook salmon are present. This closure has virtually eliminated
the taking of winter-run chinook salmon by recreational fishermen. NMFS will continue to coordinate with CDFG concerning
in-river fishing restrictions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1991, NMFS issued an ESA section 10 scientific research permit to the FWS to conduct several scientific research
studies on Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon. The FWS's Northern Central Valley Fishery Resource Office
published a report in early 1993 summarizing their 1992 activities under the permit. The results from the juvenile
monitoring program, the hatchery propagation program, and the temperature tolerance experiments are expected
to significantly contribute to NMFS efforts to protect and recover winter-run chinook salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDFG and FWS also conduct annual spawning distribution surveys of winter-run chinook salmon in the upper Sacramento
River and develop estimates of the annual spawning run size based on counts of fish passing the dam. CDFG conducts aerial
surveys each year to count winter-run chinook spawning redds and determine their distribution in the upper River.
The FWS also counts winter-run chinook salmon redds in an index area in the vicinity of Redding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1993, NMFS modified the FWS's scientific research to authorize the directed take and sacrifice of coded-wire
tagged winter-run chinook juveniles produced at Coleman National Fish Hatchery and collected during monitoring
studies in the Sacramento River, the Delta, and at the State and Federal water export facilities in the southern Delta.
The purpose of the study was to determine growth rates of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon produced at the hatchery
and released into the wild, and to help verify the size criteria developed by CDFG to separate and identify juvenile
chinook salmon by race. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the terms of the May 1988 Ten Point Restoration Plan for winter-run chinook salmon, the FWS agreed to fund and
implement a winter-run chinook salmon propagation program at the hatchery. Prior to 1991, this program was unsuccessful.
However, in 1991 the FWS was able to successfully hold and spawn six female winter-run chinook salmon despite the low
numbers of fish available (only 22), and produce and release about 11,000 juveniles into the Sacramento River near
Redding, California. In 1992, the winter-run chinook salmon spawning run size was substantially higher (1,180 fish),
more adults were collected for broodstock use, and a total of approximately 28,000 juvenile winter-run chinook salmon
with tags were released into the upper Sacramento River in late January 1993. The FWS continued this program in 1993
using approximately 17 wild adults and is currently rearing in excess of 20,000 juveniles at the hatchery. The surviving
juveniles will eventually be tagged and released into the upper Sacramento. This marking program is expected to provide
information on the timing of winter-run chinook salmon outmigration and growth. In addition, marked fish that return
to the upper Sacramento River to spawn in the future will be easily distinguishable from wild fish, thereby allowing
the FWS to assess the effectiveness of this supplementation program and ensure that hatchery produced adults are
not mated with each other. The marking program may also provide additional information concerning the ocean harvest
of winter-run chinook salmon. NMFS is currently conducting a section 7 consultation with the FWS to address the long-term
effects of this propagation program, as well as a proposed captive broodstock program, and other existing propagation
programs at the hatchery, on the wild winter-run chinook salmon population. NMFS expects to conclude consultation
and issue a biological opinion to the FWS before the end of 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In April 1992, FWS applied for a modification to its scientific research permit in order to initiate a captive breeding
program using about 1,000 juveniles that remained from the hatchery propagation effort in 1991. A primary objective
of this program was to provide insurance against extinction or loss of unique genetic variability until the wild winter-run
chinook salmon population began to recover. The goal of the program is to produce about 200 mature broodstock for each
of three consecutive years beginning in 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FWS transferred approximately 750 of the juveniles produced from adults captured during the 1991 spawning run
to the University of California's Bodega Marine Laboratory in September 1992 for extended captive rearing. A small
number of these juveniles (approximately 50) were subsequently transferred to Steinhart Aquarium in San Francisco
during March 1993 for further rearing and display. Additional juveniles produced from adults collected and spawned
in 1992 were transferred from the hatchery to Bodega Marine Laboratory for extended rearing in February 1993. As of
September 1993, the Bodega Marine Lab was rearing approximately 425 fish from the 1991 broodyear and approximately
640 fish from the 1992 broodyear. A portion of the surviving adults produced from the 1991 and 1992 broodyears may eventually
be returned to the hatchery for use as broodstock. However, these captively reared adults will not be used in any matings
nor can their progeny be released into the wild until after NMFS and FWS have concluded the ongoing section 7 consultation
that is addressing the potential adverse effects of the captive broodstock program on wild fish, and NMFS has amended
the FWS's existing ESA section 10 research and propagation permit.

3. Disease or Predation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The magnitude and extent of predation on winter-run chinook salmon in the Sacramento River and Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta are poorly known. However, studies by the FWS have found that predation at Red Bluff Diversion Dam, primarily
by squawfish, significantly contributes to the mortality of downstream winter-run chinook salmon migrants. The
FWS has undertaken periodic electrofishing below the dam which may be useful in developing a relative squawfish abundance
index. All of the fisheries agencies believe that before squawfish control is possible, more must be learned about
their life history. In 1992, the FWS conducted limited studies of predation at the fish bypass outfall as part of its
continuing evaluation of the dam and the new screens that were installed in 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has addressed this problem, in part, by requiring the Bureau, through the 1993 biological opinion on long-term
operations of the Central Valley Project, to maintain the Red Bluff Diversion Dam gates in the raised position during
most of the outmigration period. This action is expected to reduce substantially the adverse effects of predation
at the dam on juvenile winter-run chinook salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential for high levels of predation on juvenile winter-run chinook salmon also exist at the Glen-Colusa Irrigation
District (GCID) diversion facility and other manmade structures such as the California Department of Water Resource's
Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Structure and Clifton Court Forebay in the southern Delta. Predation studies conducted
by the CDFG in forebay indicate that the pre-screening mortality of marked salmonids, primarily due to predation
by striped bass, is approximately 75 percent. Squawfish and striped bass predation has also been observed on juvenile
salmonids released back into the Sacramento River from salvage operations conducted by the CDFG at State and Federal
fish protection facilities in the lower Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CDFG is conducting an extensive ongoing program to assess the abundance of predators in the forebay, remove predators
by means of gill nets and other fishing gear, and investigate and evaluate all factors that are thought to contribute
to pre-screening losses of juvenile salmonids. The February 1993 opinion on long-term operation of the CVP indirectly
address predation in the forebay by limiting the combined incidental take of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon
at the State and Federal facilities to 1 percent of the annual estimated juvenile production. In addition, implementation
of specific measures contained in the opinion's reasonable and prudent alternative, such as closure of the Delta
Cross Channel and reverse flow criteria in the western Delta, is expected to limit the diversion of juvenile winter-run
chinook salmon from the Sacramento River and their subsequent exposure to predation in the Delta and possibly Clifton
Court Forebay.

The CDFG began a large-scale program of stocking hatchery-reared striped bass in 1981 through the Striped Bass Stamp
Program authorized that year. Approximately 60,000 yearling bass were stocked that year, and the program increased
substantially in subsequent years. Beginning in 1984, the program expanded to include several private hatcheries
and two state facilities. Between 1982 and 1990, the program raised and planted nearly 3.0 million juvenile striped
bass. Additionally, privately reared yearling bass have purchased and stocked by the State's Department of Water
Resources and the Pacific Gas and Electric Company as mitigation for fish losses at their facilities in the Delta.
Since 1984, the company has purchased and stocked over 2.5 million juvenile bass, and the State has stocked almost
5.0 million juvenile bass since 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several groups raised concerns in 1992 about the possible effects of CDFG's striped bass enhancement and management
program on winter-run chinook salmon. NMFS reviewed CDFG's proposed enhancement program for 1992 and recommended
several changes, as well as the implementation of studies designed to assess the magnitude of striped bass predation
on winter-run chinook salmon. As a result of these and other concerns, CDFG eventually decided to suspend the planting
of hatchery-reared striped bass in Delta waters in 1992. In June 1993, NMFS requested that CDFG delay further release
of hatchery fish as part of its striped bass management program, and apply for an ESA section 10 incidental take permit.

4. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the final rule listing winter-run chinook salmon as threatened (55 FR 46515, November 5, 1990), NMFS concluded
that the existing regulatory mechanisms at that time were not adequate to recover the Sacramento River winter-run
chinook salmon. In the proposed rule reclassifying the species as endangered (57 FR 27416, June 19, 1992), NMFS concluded
that regulatory mechanisms might not have been sufficient or applied effectively. NMFS believes that measures currently
being taken by Federal agencies pursuant to their ESA section 7 obligations will reduce adverse impacts on the species.
However, these measures do not necessarily provide for the recovery of the species, but that the continued existence
of the species is not likely to be jeopardized. Further, the adequacy or inadequacy of these measures cannot be determined
until at least the 1996 return of adult salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NMFS believes that Title XXXIV of Public Law 102&hyph;575_Central Valley Project Improvement Act_which
was enacted by Congress in late 1992 will also contribute to the restoration and recovery of the winter-run chinook
salmon. Although that Act is intended to protect, restore, and enhance all fishery resources and habitats in the Central
Valley and Trinity River basins of California, the implementation of several provisions will directly benefit winter-run
chinook salmon and aid in its recovery. Several of the provisions are also expected to help implement actions that
NMFS has identified as necessary to avoid jeopardizing the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon and
ensure its eventual recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provisions of the Act that have the most direct beneficial effect on winter-run chinook salmon are those requiring:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Dedication of 800,000 acre-feet of CVP water for fish, wildlife, and habitat restoration purposes annually,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Installation and operation of a temperature control device at Shasta Dam and modifications of CVP operations
to control water temperatures in the upper Sacramento River, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Development and implementation of measures at the Red Bluff Diversion Dam to minimize fish passage problems,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Expansion of the FWS's existing hatchery facility,

(5) Modification of the Keswick Dam fish trap and spillway to prevent trapping of fish, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Development and implementation of a continuing program to restore and replenish lost spawning gravel in the upper
Sacramento River, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Development and implementation of a program that provides for modified operations or new and improved control
structures at the Delta Cross Channel and Georgiana Slough, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Development and implementation of a program to resolve fish passage and stranding problems associated with operation
of the ACID dam,

(10) Design and construction, in conjunction with the State of California and other Federal agencies, of a new fish
protection structure at the GCID pumping facility near Hamilton City, and

EPA is expected to propose, in December 1993, regulations that would set water quality standards for the San Francisco
Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay/Delta estuary. This is in response to EPA disapproving many elements of a water quality
control plan for salinity adopted in May 1991 by the California State Water Resources Control Board. The plan was disapproved
because it failed to adequately protect the estuarine habitat and its resources. NMFS is presently consulting with
EPA concerning the effects of the standards to be proposed on winter-run chinook salmon and its critical habitat.

Unscreened Diversions and Entrainment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Juvenile winter-run chinook salmon are subject to entrainment by large numbers of unscreened or inadequately screened
diversions during their outmigration to the Pacific Ocean. These diversions range from small siphons diverting
20 cfs to the large export facilities operated by the Bureau and Department of Water Resources in the southern Delta
that have the combined capacity of pumping approximately 12,000 cfs of water daily. The magnitude of this impact is
currently unknown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the potential impact from unscreened diversions, NMFS published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(ANPR) on October 18, 1993, that stated NMFS is considering development of regulations that would establish screening
requirements for water diversions from the Sacramento River and the Delta to protect juvenile winter-run chinook
salmon. The ANPR also requested specific information and comments concerning the numbers, types, and sizes of diversions,
the magnitude of juvenile salmon losses at unscreened diversions, the feasibility of installing positive-barrier
fish screens to reduce losses, the estimated costs of screening and available funding mechanisms, and the availability
of alternative management options for reducing fish losses due to entrainment. NMFS will evaluate all information
and comments on the ANPR to determine whether to proceed with the development of screening regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the CDFG has begun an inventory of all existing water diversions on the Sacramento River and in the Sacramento-San
Joaquin Delta to determine the number and size of unscreened diversions and identify high priority facilities requiring
screening. The Bureau, in conjunction with the State, has also established a demonstration screening program that
is expected to be implemented in 1994. This program was included as a measure to reduce taking of winter-run chinook
salmon in the incidental take statement that NMFS issued to the Bureau with the February 12, 1993, biological opinion
covering long-term CVP operations. The program is intended to promote the advancement of state-of-the-art positive
barrier screening technology at small (less than 40 cfs) unscreened diversions along the Sacramento River and within
Delta waterways.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Anderson Cottonwood Irrigation District (ACID) operates a diversion dam and two diversion facilities on the
upper Sacramento River near Redding, California. The larger of the two diversions is protected by a screen operated
and maintained by the CDFG. Until July 1992, the smaller Bonneyview water diversion facility (65 cfs capacity) was
unscreened.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In May 1992 the ACID applied for a Corps of Engineers (Corps) permit to install a screening structure at the Bonneyview
facility, and NMFS initiated section 7 consultation with the Corps to evaluate the effects of installing and operating
the structure on winter-run chinook salmon. The ACID obtained a Corps permit and installed an impervious barrier
with screens that was operational by early July 1992. Monitoring by CDFG in the irrigation canal behind the screening
structure in July and August 1992 demonstrated that the structure effectively eliminated the entrainment of juvenile
winter-run chinook salmon and other species. Subsequent dive inspections of the screening facility by the NMFS found
that the cleaning mechanism was working improperly. As a result, ACID personnel are now cleaning the screens manually
and are expected to work with NMFS and the screen manufacturer to develop an alternative cleaning mechanism.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The GCID diversion facility located near Hamilton City, California, is the single largest diverter of water on the
Sacramento River with the capacity to take up to 3,000 cfs daily. Inadequate fish screens at the facility result in
the entrainment and impingement of juvenile salmon, including winter-run chinook salmon, that are dispersing in
the river system during the peak of the irrigation season. Since 1990, NMFS has used the section 7 and section 10 provisions
of ESA, together with direct legal action, in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort to remedy the adverse effects of GCID water diversion operations on winter-run chinook salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 16, 1991, the U.S. District Court in Sacramento, California issued a temporary restraining order that required
GCID not to exceed a pumping rate of 1,100 cfs from August 19 to August 29, 1991. On January 9, 1992, the Court issued a
permanent injunction that completely enjoined GCID from diverting any water at the facility from July 15 through
November 30. The Court modified the permanent injunction in April 1992 to allow GCID to operate under the terms and
conditions of a joint stipulation that was agreed to by GCID, the Department of Justice, and the State of California.
Under the terms and conditions of the modified injunction, GCID was allowed to pump water on a restricted basis in 1992
in exchange for its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commitment to implement a long-term solution to correct existing fish passage problems at the facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following completion of an ESA section 7 consultation and the issuance of a biological opinion from NMFS on June 5,
1992, the Corps issued a 1-year permit to GCID that authorized dredging and other construction activities that were
identified as terms and conditions in the modified the permanent injunction. GCID completed construction of a training
wall, reconfiguration of the lower oxbow leading back into the Sacramento River, and additional maintenance dredging
near the screens by mid-July 1992.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In September 1992, the Corps initiated consultation with NMFS concerning a new GCID permit application to conduct
maintenance dredging and other activities at its facility over a 3-year period (1993&hyph;95). On April 22, 1993,
NMFS concluded consultation and issued a jeopardy biological opinion and incidental take statement that limited
dredging in the upper oxbow, required maintenance of the training wall and pilot cut through the lower oxbow, limited
the permit duration to a period of 1 year, and required GCID to pursue a long-term solution for protecting winter-run
chinook salmon and correcting passage problems at the facility. Following issuance of the Corps permit, GCID conducted
maintenance dredging and other maintenance activities in accordance with the requirements of the biological opinion,
and subsequently began pumping water on a restricted basis beginning on August 1, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Justice and GCID signed a new stipulated agreement in June 1993 that allowed operations to continue
in 1993. This new agreement, in conjunction with the biological opinion that was issued to the Corps, restricted pumping
activities at the Hamilton City facility, required various types of monitoring, and committed GCID to ensure the
implementation of long-term protective and conservation measures for winter-run chinook salmon at its Hamilton
City facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, GCID, the State of California, and the Corps began a joint Federal and state environmental review process
to evaluate several long-term alternatives for correcting fish entrainment, impingement, and passage problems
at the GCID facility. The Bureau is now the lead Federal agency responsible for preparing the environmental documentation
and constructing the selected long-term protective and conservation measures due to the passage of the Central Valley
Improvement Act. The environmental review process has been delayed, but is expected to be completed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mid-1994. NMFS will consult with the Bureau to evaluate the effects of constructing and operating the selected long-term
protection alternative on winter-run chinook salmon.

Delta Export Facilities of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bureau and the California Department of Water Resources operate facilities in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
to convey Sacramento River water into and through the Delta and to export water out of the Delta. These facilities include
the Delta Cross Channel operated by the Bureau, and water export and fish protection facilities operated by the Bureau
(Tracy Pumping Plant) and California Department of Water Resources (Byron Pumping Plant). The operations of these
and other Central Valley and State water facilities, which are coordinated through the Coordinated Operations Agreement
between the Bureau and the State, can adversely impact winter-run chinook salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address the potential adverse effects of gate operations on juvenile winter-run chinook salmon survival in 1992,
NMFS included a reasonable and prudent alternative measure in the February 14, 1992, biological opinion for 1992
CVP operations requiring the Bureau to close the Delta Cross Channel from February 1 through May 1, 1992. This action
was expected to substantially reduce the diversion of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon into the Delta from the
Sacramento River, especially with the extremely critical water supply and low export pumping rates that were anticipated
to occur in 1992. Operation of the Federal and State export facilities in 1992 was not expected to incidentally take
more than a small percentage of the 1991 winter-run chinook salmon outmigrant population. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, based on monitoring at these facilities during February and March 1992, NMFS determined that the taking
of juveniles exceeded the amount identified in the incidental take statement, and requested consultation be reinitiated.
After further consultation with the Bureau and the State was completed, NMFS amended the incidental take statement
to restrict the combined daily water export rate from both facilities to 1,200 cfs during the remainder of April 1992.
The amended take statement also required that consultation be reinitiated if the incidental take of juveniles exceeded
400 fish during this period or there was evidence to indicate that winter-run outmigration would substantially continue
beyond April 30, 1992, and required both the Bureau and the State to support efforts to develop a more refined and accurate
method for determining the level of taking incidental to pumping operations at the water export facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the losses of juvenile fish at these facilities were higher than expected in the spring of 1992, NMFS and the
CDFG established a Delta Salvage and Loss Working Group consisting of representatives from NMFS, FWS, the California
Departments of Fish and Game and Water Resources, and the Bureau. The objectives of this group were to (1) review and
refine the juvenile winter-run chinook salmon loss estimates at the water export facilities during the 1992 outmigration
period, and (2) evaluate the loss estimation and reporting procedures used in 1992 and make recommendations for improving
the procedures for 1993 and future years. The group met frequently to discuss these issues and issued a summary report
in September 1992 that included a revised estimate of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon losses in 1992 and a series
of recommendations for loss estimation and reporting. The loss estimation and reporting procedures developed by
this group were eventually incorporated into the February 12, 1993, biological opinion and incidental take statement
that NMFS issued to the Bureau on the long-term operations of the Federal and State water projects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The biological opinion also includes protective measures designed to reduce the impact of Delta operations on winter-run
chinook salmon. The reasonable and prudent alternative in the opinion contains the following measures to avoid jeopardizing
the continued existence of winter-run chinook salmon: (1) Closure of the Delta Cross Channel each year from February
1 through April 30; (2) operation of the cross channel gate each year from October 1 through January 31 to minimize the
diversion of juveniles into the Delta based on the use of a real-time monitoring program; (3) operation of the delta
water export facilities each year to ensure that no reverse flow conditions occur in the western Delta from February
1 through April 30; (4) operation of the delta export facilities each year to ensure that reverse flow conditions are
minimized from November 1 through January 31; and (5) monitoring of winter-run chinook incidental take at the Federal
and State export facilities. The incidental take statement included with the opinion also contains measures designed
to minimize the taking of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon incidental to the operation of the water export facilities.
This take statement identifies the level of incidental taking by the Bureau and State export facilities to be no more
than 1 percent of the estimated number of outmigrant juvenile winter-run chinook salmon entering the Delta in any
year, and requires the Bureau and the State to submit daily, weekly, and annual reports based on an extensive monitoring
program to ensure the incidental take authorization is not exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the 1992 run size estimate (1,180 fish), NMFS determined that the allowable take of outmigrating juvenile
winter-run chinook salmon incidental to operation of the export facilities in 1992&hyph;93 was 2,700 fish. Monitoring
of winter-run chinook salmon incidental take during the 1993 outmigration season indicated that the level of taking
was substantially higher at the State export facility than at the Federal export facility. The monitoring program
also indicated that the rate of taking by mid-February 1993 was higher than anticipated, and that continued high pumping
rates could result in exceeding the annual take level authorized by NMFS. As a result, the State voluntarily curtailed
pumping at its Delta pumping facility in late February to reduce the loss rate and cumulative loss of juvenile winter-run
chinook salmon at its facility. Although pumping rates were gradually increased during March and April 1993 at the
State facility, the cumulative loss of juveniles was less than 1 percent of the estimated outmigrant population in
1993. As a result of these and other actions taken by the State and Bureau in accordance with the February 12, 1993, biological
opinion and incidental take statement, NMFS believes that the survival of outmigrating juveniles in 1993 was significantly
improved over previous years. Continued implementation of these protective measures in future years is expected
to improve outmigration success of juvenile winter-run chinook salmon and aid in recovery.

Suisun Marsh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Operation of the Suisun Marsh salinity control gate structure by the State can potentially affect winter-run chinook
adversely by diverting outmigrating juveniles from the Sacramento River into Montezuma Slough where conditions
for survival are poorer because diverted fish have a longer migration route, and are exposed to increased water temperatures,
increased predation, and numerous unscreened water diversions. Upstream migrant adult winter-run chinook that
enter the downstream end of Montezuma Slough may also be blocked or delayed by operation of the gates as they attempt
to migrate into the Sacramento River. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to minimize impacts on winter-run chinook salmon juveniles, NMFS required (in the 1992 CVP opinion) that
salinity control gates to either close from March 1 through April 15, or that unscreened diversions in the Slough not
operate during this period. The California Departments of Water Resources and Fish and Game conducted monitoring
during this period and provided documentation to NMFS that these diversions were not operated. However, sampling
by FWS during April 1992 also indicated that only a small percentage of marked juvenile salmonids (0.2&hyph;1.5 percent)
were diverted into Montezuma Slough. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the potential impacts of operating the salinity control gates on winter-run chinook salmon are unclear based
on the available information, NMFS addressed the need for additional studies at the facility in the incidental take
statement included with the 1993 CVP biological opinion. Specifically, the incidental take statement requires
the Bureau and the State to develop and implement a program to evaluate the effects of operating the salinity control
structure on winter-run chinook salmon by spring 1994. The program is expected to assess the diversion rate of chinook
salmon juveniles into Montezuma Slough, predation at the structure, survival of juveniles passing through the slough,
and passage of adults upstream.

Droughts/El Ni&ntilde;o 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The natural factors of greatest concern to NMFS are drought conditions and the oceanographic phenomenon known as
El Ni&ntilde;o. The effects of the extended 1987&hyph;1992 drought on California's water supply have likely exacerbated
the effects of management of State and Federal water operations and other activities on winter-run chinook salmon
over the past several years. However, the end of the drought in 1993 due to above normal levels of precipitation throughout
the State, and the implementation of protective measures contained in NMFS February 12, 1993, biological opinion
are expected to reduce the adverse effects of drought in future years by ensuring that minimum carryover storage is
maintained in Shasta Reservoir each year, and that conservative water supply forecasts are used by the Bureau to make
annual water allocation decisions. In addition to these measures, the Bureau is expected to construct a temperature
control device at Shasta Reservoir that should improve its ability to provide suitable water temperatures in the
upper Sacramento River. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The El Ni&ntilde;o event that began in 1991&hyph;1992 may result in reduced ocean survival of winter-run chinook
salmon produced in 1990 and 1991 when the estimated run sizes were very low (441 and 191 fish respectively) and drought
conditions prevailed. For these and other reasons, NMFS anticipated that the 1993 run size would be low, and also expects
that the run size in 1994 will be weak. The only measure that may help to mitigate the impact of El Ni&ntilde;o events
may be the hatchery supplementation program developed by the FWS to augment natural juvenile production. If the hatchery
supplementation program proves to be successful, it may provide the necessary juvenile production to offset any
adverse effects of El Ni&ntilde;o conditions.

Conclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the winter-run chinook salmon was formally listed as a threatened species in November 1990 (55 FR 46515), the
annual estimated run sizes have become more variable and have continued to decline with the exception of an increase
in 1992. Although some protective measures were implemented beginning in 1987, the decline was exacerbated by a 6-year
drought in California (1987&hyph;1992) and threats adversely affecting the species that were not addressed until
recently. Based on the run size estimates for the last 3 years (1991&hyph;1993), the population now has at least one
and possibly two extremely weak year classes (1991 and 1993). NMFS expects that the 1994 run will also be weak because
of the small numbers of adults returning in 1991 (191 fish) and less than favorable conditions for spawning, egg incubation,
and juvenile outmigration that occurred in 1991&hyph;92. This years class is likely to remain weakened for the foreseeable
future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although conditions for winter-run chinook salmon began improving in 1992 and 1993 because of protective measures
implemented to reduce the long-term impacts of operations of the Federal and State water projects and improve conditions
for successful egg incubation, rearing, and outmigration, the 6-year drought ended, and the natural production
of juveniles is being supplemented with hatchery produced fish, NMFS believes that quantifiable improvements in
population levels are not likely to be evident for several years. Since the effectiveness of these recently implemented
protective measures and supplementation efforts is unknown and cannot be assessed until future runs return, there
remains substantial risk that the population is in danger of extinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the continued decline of the population and increased variability of run sizes since 1991, the expected weak
return in 1994, continuing threats to the population, and uncertainty about whether recently implemented protective
and conservation measures will be effective, NMFS believes that the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon
is in danger of becoming extinct and should be classified as an endangered species. NMFS will continue to monitor closely
the status of this population as well as evaluate the effectiveness of existing and future protective and conservation
measures to determine whether any further changes in its status are warranted.

Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species that are listed under the ESA include listing, recovery actions, implementation
of certain protective measures, and designation and protection of critical habitat. Some of the most useful protective
measures are contained in section 7 of the ESA. Pursuant to section 7, Federal agencies are required to conduct conservation
programs for endangered species and to consult with NMFS regarding the potential effects of their actions on winter-run
chinook salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since winter-run chinook salmon was originally listed as a threatened species on an emergency basis in August 1989,
NMFS has conducted numerous section 7 consultations with Federal agencies whose actions may affect the species.
The most significant consultations have been with the Bureau and the California Department of Water Resources concerning
the long-term operations of the Central Valley Project and the State Water Project and the Corps concerning fish passage
at the GCID diversion facility at Hamilton City. NMFS is currently engaged in consultations with other Federal agencies
and will continue this process to determine whether Federal actions affect winter-run chinook salmon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 10 of the ESA provides for addressing the effects of private and state (non-Federal) actions on endangered
species. NMFS has worked with GCID to address the impacts of their major diversion facility on winter-run chinook
salmon through this process. NMFS also expects to work with the CDFG to address potentially adverse effects of striped
bass and salmon hatchery management on winter-run chinook salmon. In the future, NMFS will continue to pursue opportunities
to remedy private and non-Federal activities that may affect winter-run chinook salmon through this process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, NMFS established a National Sacramento River Winter-run Chinook Salmon recovery team to develop a recovery
plan for the species. The team is comprised of fishery resource managers, experts on winter-run chinook salmon biology
and, other conservation specialists. The recovery team meets frequently and expects to complete development of
a comprehensive draft recovery plan in 1994.

Critical Habitat

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3)(A) of the ESA requires that, to the extent that it is prudent and determinable, critical habitat be
designated concurrently with the listing of a species. NMFS published a final rule designating critical habitat
for Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon on June 16, 1993. The designated critical habitat includes: the Sacramento
River from Keswick Dam (RM 302) to Chipps Island (RM 0) at the westward margin of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta,
all waters from Chipps Island westward to Carquinez Bridge, all waters of San Pablo Bay, and all waters in San Francisco
Bay north of the San Francisco/Oakland Bay Bridge. The final rule also identifies those physical and biological features
of the habitat that are essential to the conservation of winter-run chinook salmon.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing a final hazardous waste listing determination for wastes
generated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations in wood surface protection processes. Upon reviewing the
public comments received on its proposal of April 27, 1993, the Agency has decided not to list wastes from the use of
chlorophenolic formulations in wood surface protection processes. As a result of this determination, EPA is not
mandating in this rule any specific operating or information collection requirements for owners/operators of wood
surface protection plants. If, however, use of chlorophenolic formulations resumes in the future, the Agency would
very likely re-evaluate this decision not to list. This rule also finalizes the proposed amendment of SW&hyph;846
(``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods'') to include Method 4010 (Immunoassay
Test for the Presence of Pentachlorophenol). In addition, the Agency is adding the following four chemicals to 40
CFR part 261, Appendix VIII: Sodium and potassium salts of pentachlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 3001(e) of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), EPA is required
to make a hazardous waste listing determination for wastes containing chlorinated dioxins and dibenzofurans. As
part of this mandate, the Agency began an investigation in 1988 of dioxin-containing wastes from wood preserving
and wood surface protection processes. Three categories of wastes from wood preserving processes were listed as
hazardous wastes in 1990, (F032, F034, and F035, see 55 FR 50450). A final listing determination for wood surface protection
process wastes were deferred due to lack of data (53 FR 53282). In 1991, the Agency began a separate study of the surface
protection industry in an effort to obtain sufficient information upon which to base a hazardous waste listing determination.
The Agency, upon obtaining and evaluating information, published a proposed rule on April 27, 1993 which proposed
a concentration-based hazardous waste listing option and requested comment on an alternative option not to list
these wastes as hazardous (58 FR 25707). Details of the options can be found in the following section to this preamble.
A detailed summary of all Agency actions related to wood surface protection wastes was provided in the April 27, 1993
proposal (58 FR 25707). The reader is encouraged to consult that document for more information on the wood surface
protection rulemaking history.

 (U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, case no. 89&hyph;0591), the Agency has agreed to make a final listing
determination for chlorophenolic wastes from wood surface protection processes by December 31, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considerable review and study of the rulemaking docket for this action, including comments received on the
proposal, the Agency has determined that listing as hazardous wastes from surface protection operations is unnecessary
and will not yield the benefits intended by a hazardous waste listing under the RCRA program. This section summarizes
elements of the proposed rule of April 27, 1993 (58 FR 25707), and details the conclusions reached in developing this
final rule. The reader is cautioned that although some of the highlights brought up in the proposed rule are described
below, the majority of information on the industry itself as well as the detailed risk assessment on which the initial
proposed rule was based is found in the preamble and background documents to the proposed rule. The information contained
in this final rule is primarily concerned with developments subsequent to the proposed rule. This rule describes,
in detail, the Agency's justification for not listing wastes from surface protection processes that use chlorophenolic
formulations. In addition, it summarizes the Agency's response to comments received on the proposal.

III. Overview of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The April 27, 1993 proposal discussed and requested comment on each of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Proposing a concentration-based hazardous waste listing for certain wood surface protection wastes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Proposing various testing, analysis, recordkeeping requirements and management standards for wood surface
protection plants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Adding six hazardous constituents to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261, (4) Amending of appendix VII of 40 CFR part
261 by adding F033 and the hazardous constituents found in the wastes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Modifying the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) list of hazardous
substances to reflect the newly proposed listing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Amending SW&hyph;846 (``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods'') to include
Method 4010 (Immunoassay Test for the Presence of Pentachlorophenol), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) An alternative option not listing chlorophenolic wastes as hazardous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Agency proposed to list as hazardous at 40 CFR 261.31 only those wastes from wood surface protection processes
using a formulation with a pentachlorophenate concentration greater than 0.1 ppm. Under this proposed option, surface
protection operations using formulations with pentachlorophenate concentrations equal to or less than 0.1 ppm
would not generate F033 listed wastes. The Agency proposed this concentration-based listing because it had information
which suggested that many surface protectors who previously used chlorophenolics did not sufficiently clean out
equipment prior to abandoning the use of chlorophenolics. Because of this, many formulations from past users of chlorophenolics
exhibit ``cross-contamination,'' the contamination of current formulations by dioxins and chlorophenolic compounds
from old formulations. The rule proposed the following hazardous waste listing description for the F033 waste code
and included the following specific waste streams from process operations:

Along with this option, various testing and recordkeeping requirements were proposed. For an owner/operator to
demonstrate that he/she is not generating F033 wastes, EPA proposed formulation testing requirements for all surface
protection plants. All owner/operators of wood surface protection plants would be required to test their formulation
to determine the concentration of pentachlorophenate if the owner/operators wanted to avoid generating F033 wastes.
If the analysis showed a concentration at or below 0.1 ppm, the owner/operator would be required to sign a certification
to that effect and maintain records on site related to the testing procedure. This testing proposed an analysis using
a method listed within the EPA's Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods (SW&hyph;846).
The Agency proposed to add Method 4010 to SW&hyph;846. Method 4010 is an immunoassay test for the presence of pentachlorophenol,
which determines whether a sample is above or below a set limit (such as the 0.1 ppm concentration level proposed).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, if analysis showed that a facility's formulation contains pentachlorophenate at levels exceeding
0.1 ppm, then the wastes generated from surface protection at that facility would be F033 wastes and the owner/operator
would be subject to additional operating requirements proposed as subpart T of parts 264 and 265. For details on the
specific operating requirements, the reader should refer to the proposed notice (58 FR 25706). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of the constituents of concern that are present in wastes generated from wood surface protection processes
which use chlorophenolic formulations do not appear on the list of hazardous constituents at 40 CFR part 261, appendix
VIII. The Agency proposed to add six hazardous constituents to appendix VIII: sodium pentachlorophenate, potassium
pentachlorophenate, the sodium salt of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol, the potassium salt of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol,
octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) and octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sodium and potassium pentachlorophenate are the sodium and potassium salts of pentachlorophenol. These salts were
proposed for addition to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261 since, as a result of gastric secretions following ingestion,
the sodium and potassium salts of pentachlorophenol and 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol are readily converted to the
corresponding phenols by acidification. Therefore, the sodium and potassium salts are reasonably expected to elicit
the same health effects as the corresponding phenols. For this reason, the Agency proposed to add these four compounds
to the list of hazardous constituents in appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also requested comment on an option not to list as hazardous wastes generated from surface protection processes.
The Agency included the so-called ``no-list'' option in the proposal because the future generation of chlorophenolic
wastes is expected to diminish rapidly to zero and because the results of risk analyses show that the risks from the
dominant exposure pathways are relatively modest, assuming the widespread use of chlorophenolic formulations
does not resume. The Agency believed at the time of the proposal that reintroduction of chlorophenolic formulations
into the market place in the future was not likely to occur. EPA also noted that the Agency would always have the option
of reconsidering the listing determination should chlorophenolic surface protection formulations be reintroduced
in the future.

IV. Summary of Public Comments and Responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments received on the proposed rule are placed under two separate headings for purposes of this summary. The first
addresses the more general comments associated with the proposal, including those relating to: (1) General implementation
issues of a listing for wastes generated by the wood surface protection industry; (2) technical approaches discussed
in the proposal relating to data sampling methodologies; and (3) various engineering assumptions on which the proposed
listing was based. The second part of this section describes the Agency's response to comments dealing with the risk
assessment methodology used to support the listing determination for these wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several comments were submitted on the proposed listing of F033 wastes. Four commenters supported the listing in
general and two commenters supported the concentration-based approach in particular. Three commenters opposed
the proposed listing and urged EPA to rely on its authority under FIFRA to control the risks posed by chlorophenolic
formulations. One commenter supported an outright ban on the use of chlorophenolics for wood surface treatment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters warned that listing F033 wastes would hinder remediation efforts at contaminated wood surface protection
sites. The Agency agrees with the commenters' point that a hazardous waste listing may provide a disincentive for
owner/operators of surface protection plants to initiate voluntary remediation efforts. The regulation of potentially
large amounts of contaminated soil as listed hazardous waste could delay the start of cleanup due to the administrative
and economic realities of regulatory compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters expressed concern over the possibly perceived interchangeability of the proposed 0.1 ppm concentration
level and the Toxicity Characteristic (TC) regulatory level for pentachlorophenol. Although the Agency is not finalizing
the F033 hazardous waste listing, EPA nevertheless wants to make clear that the concentration level proposed in the
F033 listing description was not intended as a regulatory level for any purpose other than defining a waste as F033.
The current regulatory level for pentachlorophenol that defines a waste as hazardous under the TC (100 mg/L) would
not have been affected by this rulemaking in any way had the F033 listing been promulgated today. Levels set for the
TC are obtained by running models which simulate acidic landfill conditions. For the proposed listing, the proposed
0.1 ppm level was calculated using a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) of 0.001 ppm and a risk analysis using the Agency's
Multi-med model. Multi-med simulates groundwater contamination from specific sources, and for this proposal,
it incorporated variables which are specific to sawmill conditions. The Agency's analysis approximated the dilution
of pentachlorophenate from the time the waste contacts the ground to when it reaches a ground water well. The Agency
did not arrive at the 0.1 ppm level by applying a dilution attenuation factor (DAF) of 100 (as the Agency has done in other
circumstances) to the MCL. Indeed, the Agency did not take a position in the proposal about the use of DAFs in calculating
acceptable risk levels for any constituents. A detailed discussion of the Agency's modeling assumptions and actual
parameters used to generate risk approximations can be found in the docket for the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter expressed reservations regarding the decontamination procedures promulgated previously for wood
preserving equipment (55 FR 50482&hyph;50483, December 6, 1990). The Agency is aware that equipment cleaning will
not always prevent cross-contamination. However, it will certainly reduce the amount of contamination that would
occur if no equipment cleaning took place. Although the Agency is not finalizing the proposed F033 hazardous waste
listing, EPA encourages owner/operators of surface protection plants to clean or replace any surface-treating
equipment that was used previously with chlorophenolic formulations upon a switch to non-chlorophenolic chemicals
and properly dispose of the wastes in an environmentally sound manner. Furthermore, the Agency has obtained information
which shows that some new substitute products are more effective if residual chlorophenolic contamination is removed.
Hence, removing sludge and cleaning equipment from previous chlorophenolic use will not only be more environmentally
sound, but may also enhance the new products effectiveness. Methodology on recommended cleaning and operating practices
for surface protectors will be published in the near future by the Agency in a pollution prevention and waste minimization
guidance document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the proposed operating standards for surface protection plants be codified in part
262 as opposed to parts 264/265. The commenter reasoned that most surface protection plants are only generators and
do not function as treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs). However, since the F033 hazardous waste
listing is not being promulgated, this issue is moot and there is no need for special generator requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters had specific concerns about the applicability of the proposed F033 listing. Since the Agency
is not finalizing the proposed F033 listing, these concerns are also moot. However, where appropriate, answers specific
to each of these comments have been addressed in the background document of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned the representativeness of the Agency's data on cross-contamination. The commenter stated
that because sites were not randomly selected, there is no true sample representation of the surface protector population.
EPA did not choose sampling sites based on their statistical representativeness. Rather, the sites were selected
as appropriate from what the Agency considered to be typical operating plants. The Agency visited more than 15 surface
protection sites in the Nation (both large and small plants). From the information obtained from these plant tours
and interviews, the Agency developed a view of what it considered typical from an engineering standpoint (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 size of equipment, production scale, presence of containment systems, size of storage yards, amount of drippage,
etc). The sites sampled need not represent the entire surface protection industry in terms of the process used and
the degree of cross-contamination present to allow the Agency to demonstrate that wastes from current and previous
use of chlorophenolics at surface protection sites were contaminated with the constituents of concern. These sites
were chosen from information obtained by a questionnaire sent out under the Agency's 3007 RCRA authority.

B. Comments Regarding Risk Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five commenters responded to the risk assessment presented in the proposed rule. One commenter stated that the EPA
incorrectly converted units of measurement in the record sampling data used for the risk assessment causing the overestimation
of incremental risk for the fish/shellfish consumption and soil ingestion pathways by a 1,000-fold. The EPA agrees
with the commenter. The dioxin concentrations in the formulation at one of the affected facilities (Aquasco, MD)
were reported in the wrong units, causing a 1,000-fold error to be incorporated into the risk estimates for the fish
and shellfish ingestion and soil ingestion scenarios. When this error is corrected, the TCDD-TEQ dioxin levels used
as the source concentration (the concentration of formulation dripping onto the ground) for affected facilities
(cross-contamination from past use of chlorophenolic formulations) and used in the lifetime individual risk estimates
for the soil ingestion scenario and fish and shellfish ingestion scenario were reduced by a 1,000-fold. The lifetime
individual risk values using the corrected data are presented in Table 1.

The estimated risk to any one individual using the corrected values are 1,000-fold lower than the risk estimated in
the proposed rule from cross-contamination due to past use. In this case for the typically exposed individual in the
general population, the incremental risk of developing cancer is a chance of 0.8 in a trillion (8E&hyph;13); in the
recreational fisher person, the risk of developing cancer is increased by only 2E&hyph;12. The estimated incremental
population risk is also reduced, after correction, approximately by a 1,000-fold, to 0.0002 cases/70 years for the
anticipated increase in the development of cancer as a result of exposure to ingestion of fish/shellfish contaminated
with wastes from the use of chlorophenolic formulations for wood surface protection. Chart 1 in Section V Part A of
this final rule shows the original values reported in the April 27, 1993 proposed notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The soil ingestion scenarios also were based on the storage yard soil concentrations. The soil ingestion scenario
assumed that children ages 1 to 6 could come into contact with the contaminated soil at the sawmill sites because sawmill
sites could be converted to rural residential land use and the child's play area could be located on the area previously
used as a storage yard area. The lifetime individual risks, using the corrected formulation concentration values
for dioxin, associated with the soil ingestion scenario for cross-contamination from past users of chlorophenolic
formulations are presented in Table 2.

The estimates presented in Table 2 show that the incremental risks from direct soil ingestion by children are below
what the Agency considers a level of concern. A child exposed to storage yard soils cross-contaminated by past users
of chlorophenolics under typical conditions (consumption of 0.1 gram of soil/day for 160 days/year for six years)
would be subject to an increased cancer risk of 7E&hyph;10 over a lifetime, or a chance of 0.7 in a billion. The estimated
incremental population risk is also reduced approximately 1,000-fold (to 4E&hyph;7 cases per year over a 70-year
period) for the anticipated increase in the development of cancer as a result of exposure to direct ingestion of soil
contaminated with wastes from the use of cross-contaminated formulations for wood surface protection.

One commenter remarked that the EPA failed to specifically address the incremental risks to subsistence fisher persons
from consumption of fish/shellfish contaminated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations for wood surface protection.
EPA agrees that the risks to highly exposed sub-populations should be considered. The fish ingestion scenarios developed
for the proposed rule considered exposure to a general population and recreational fisher at the outflow of a drainage
area containing surface protection facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA used the analysis for the high end recreational fisher to approximate the risk to the subsistence fisher. Recent
data show that the high end ingestion rate for a subsistence fisher is greater than for a recreational fisher by a factor
of approximately 2. Therefore, the incremental risk for a subsistence fisher would not exceed a level of concern,
since the projected risk to recreational fishers is much less than 10

The analysis of risks from fish consumption assumes that all fish in the drainage basin are contaminated. The estimates
of PCDDs and PCDFs in fish tissue are based on sediment concentrations of these constituents. The sediment concentrations
are estimated based on the erosion of contaminated soils from sawmill sites in a river or stream basin and subsequent
dilution of contaminant levels by the erosion of uncontaminated soils from the corresponding drainage basin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The projected risk levels increase as the size of the drainage area decreases, due to the relatively lower amounts
of uncontaminated soil in smaller drainage basins. EPA performed an analysis which shows that, even with all exposure
parameters set at values which would maximize the overall estimate of exposure, in order to reach a risk level of 10

, the drainage area would need to be 8,000 hectares or less, which is smaller than the smallest drainage area in the country.
The average drainage area is 440,000 hectares, and the lower fifth percentile of the size distribution is 109,000
hectares.

With regard to the fish/shellfish ingestion scenario, one commenter maintained that the fish/shellfish ingestion
scenario should have been performed on a site-specific basis (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 EPA should have used parameters seen at individual sites), because not all sawmills are located on streams with commercial
fisheries. The EPA chose the fish/shellfish ingestion scenario to be protective of the recreational fisher persons
and the general population. The risk analysis was structured so that the hydrologic cataloguing unit (or watershed)
was the basic unit of analysis to ensure that the contaminated sediment would be associated with a body of water large
enough to support fish hatcheries and recreational fisher persons. When these assumptions were used in the fish/shellfish
ingestion scenario using corrected values for dioxin found in formulation for PCDDs and PCDFs, the incremental risk
to individuals with high-end exposures remains well below 1&times;10

With regard to the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), one commenter asserted that the equation is overly conservative
for estimating soil erosion from surface protection sites. This equation models the amount of soil which is dumped
into a drainage area containing fish. For a more detailed description of the model, the reader is referred to background
document of the proposed rule. The EPA believes that, although this may be a conservative approach, it is the best method
currently available. It has been used to support other EPA rulemakings and guidance documents. The most notable example
being the Assessment of Risks from Exposure of Humans, Terrestrial and Avian Wildlife, and Aquatic Life to Dioxins
and Furans, from Disposal and Use of Sludge from Bleached Kraft and Sulfite Pulp and Paper Mills.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Even using these conservative assumptions, the incremental risks from cross- contamination at these sites are not
at a level of concern.

One commenter suggested that the population risks attributable to the contaminated fish/shellfish ingestion scenario
were too high because the entire U.S. population was considered to be exposed. EPA disagrees and believes it is appropriate
to consider the consumption rate of the entire population in estimating risk to the general population from this exposure
pathway. However, an adjustment of 0.4 was made to the diet fraction to account for the fact that not all fish are contaminated.
Thus, only some percentage of the population would be affected by the contaminated fish. As discussed in the Risk Assessment
Background Document for the proposed rule, the 0.4 diet fraction was derived by estimating the percentage of rivers
and streams (i.e., cataloguing units) that have at least one sawmill. A second adjustment was made in the calculation
of population risk to account for the percentage of sawmills that operate surface protection processes (about 30%
of the entire number of sawmills nationally). Population risk for the fish/shellfish ingestion scenario has been
recalculated for the final rule using the corrected incremental storage yard soil TCDD-TEQ concentrations. The
corrected estimate of incremental population risk from cross-contamination is three orders of magnitude lower
than the risk originally stated in the proposed rule. The corrected number of cancer cases expected in 70 years is now
0.0002.

One commenter asserted that the soil ingestion scenario was overly conservative because all of the soil consumption
was attributed to contaminated storage yard soil and no consumption of ``indoor dust'' was considered. EPA considered
only the consumption of storage yard soil in order to be protective of human health. The range of soil ingestion rates
for average children aged 1 through 6 is presented in the EPA's Exposure Factors Handbook (1990) as 0.2 to 0.8 grams
per day. These estimated values were determined from the clay content of fecal samples taken from children in this
age group and thus represent consumption of soil. However, the percent of this consumption that is attributed to house
dust is unknown, as is the contaminant concentration in the house dust. The EPA has recalculated the soil ingestion
scenario using the corrected incremental TCDD-TEQ concentrations obtained from the formulation sample. The incremental
risk estimated is below 1E&hyph;6, using the conservative assumptions. The Agency's risk levels are particularly
protective with the use of these conservative assumptions, thereby further lending support to the Agency's decision
not to list these wastes.

One commenter stated that children are unlikely to consume sediment at the same rate that they consume soil. The Agency
agrees, but notes that sediment consumption by children was not considered as an exposure pathway in the proposed
rule. The Agency does not feel that this exposure pathway is a significant one in making a determination whether or
not to list chlorophenolic wastes since the exposure areas of concern are relatively small and any land conversion
which could take place would most likely require soil testing prior to land development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the assumptions used to estimate the exposed population in the soil ingestion population
risk scenario greatly overestimate the number of exposed children. EPA believes that the scenario may be conservative,
but not implausible. The scenario assumes that all sawmill sites are converted to rural residential land use, that
the children's play areas are located on the site of the former storage yards, and that the homes are resold to new families
with young children every 25 years. These assumptions include a low population density in these areas. It would take
only a limited number of sites to be converted to suburban housing or to daycare or school facilities to cause a substantial
increase in the exposed population. The incremental population risk estimated using the corrected incremental
value for the storage yard soil TCDD-TEQ concentration is 4E&hyph;7 cases in 70 years, three orders of magnitude lower
than that in the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter maintained that the soil ingestion scenario was questionable because Superfund liabilities, state
laws, and lender requirements make land use changes unlikely without site cleanup activities. The EPA agrees that,
in some states, land transfers and subsequent land use changes would be unlikely to occur without cleanup. However,
not all states are equally diligent in requiring site investigations at the time of property transfer, making the
types of land use changes described in the soil ingestion scenario plausible. Because of this, EPA believes it is entirely
appropriate to assess risk via the soil ingestion pathway, notwithstanding any risk management decisions that may
be made at some future time to address the risk.

Two commenters believed that some of the values used as input parameters to the ground-water model (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 recharge rate, regional conductivity, and average depth to water) were too conservative and that more appropriate
input parameters should be used in this MULTIMED model. One commenter believed that the Agency had used DRASTIC (a
name given to a modelling program used to evaluate the potential which may exist resulting from groundwater pollution)
to perform its groundwater modeling. First, the EPA did not use the DRASTIC model in this rulemaking effort; it used
the MULTIMED model developed by the Agency to perform groundwater models. The Agency did, however, use some soil and
hydrogeologic information (on hydrogeologic regions and subregions collected by Aller 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1988)) which is used when applying the DRASTIC model. With regard to the parameters felt by the commenter to be too
conservative, the EPA supports the values used in the proposed rule (58 FR at 25706 of April 27, 1993). This hydrogeologic
information includes many of the input parameters required to run the MULTIMED model, and includes such parameters
as depth to water, soil type and hydraulic conductivity, net recharge, aquifer hydraulic conductivity. The EPA selected
hydrogeologic subregions in the northwest and southeast United States, excluding subregions where sawmills were
not likely to be sited (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 mountain slopes or flanks). Since the parameter value ranges presented in Aller 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1988) are based on compilations of literature values and expert opinion, the values should be viewed as bounding
ranges, and are not sufficiently statistically rigorous to estimate true means or parameter distributions. For
the average case, ``typical'' parameter values were obtained by examining the ranges of values in Aller 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1988) for the selected subregions only and selecting values representing the central tendency of the reported ranges.
Similarly, high-end values were selected to represent the high end of the exposure distribution, using the higher
end of the range of parameter values deemed likely to occur by Aller 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1988). EPA recognizes that there are limitations to this approach, largely associated with the non-statistical
nature of the data. The Agency believes, however, that this data source is the best available at this time for regional
and subregional estimates of the hydrogeologic properties necessary to estimate exposures through the ground-water
pathway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters felt that the Agency's use of input parameter values used for well location and well intake point were
too conservative. EPA derived the horizontal distance to wells from the responses reported in the RCRA's 3007 Industry
Questionnaires. Because information was not obtained on the well type or construction, all wells described in the
questionnaire were assumed to be possible sources of drinking water and were assumed to be screened to the top of the
aquifer, that is, well water was assumed to be drawn off the top of the aquifer where organics are assumed to exist in
greater concentrations than when water is drawn from the middle of the aquifer. These assumptions are consistent
with similar conservative assumptions used to develop other RCRA regulations, such as the Toxicity Characteristic
(55 FR 11798, March 29, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters contended that neither biodegradation or chemical degradation rates were considered in the ground-water
modeling of pentachlorophenol contamination. These commenters submitted studies showing that biological and
chemical degradation of PCP can occur and that adequate biological and chemical degradation rates are available
or can be estimated from these studies. EPA has reviewed these studies and agrees that they do indicate that biological
and chemical degradation of PCP can occur. The information submitted by the commenters are results from laboratory
studies, reporting the results from controlled experiments. However, EPA does not agree that there is sufficient
information on unassisted field degradation rates, the geochemical factors that affect degradation, or their spatial
variability from site-to-site or region-to-region to model degradation in the field at generic or prototypical
sites for regulatory purposes. Moreover, the existence of metabolites that would confirm the occurrence of biodegradation
in the field has not been firmly established. Therefore, EPA does not believe the data warrant an assumption that biodegradation
does occur at significant rates at most sites. In addition, the toxicities of potential degradation products have
not been characterized. Therefore, the EPA does not believe it is appropriate to consider these mechanisms in this
rulemaking.

One commenter suggested that it would be more appropriate to calculate the average peak concentration of pentachlorophenate
in groundwater used to reflect a 9-year exposure duration by producing a breakthrough curve of annual concentrations
at a well using the MULTIMED model and calculate a series of 9-year or 10-year moving averages. The moving averages
would be sorted in descending order and a paper plot prepared. A preferred percentile value could then be selected
as the concentration of concern. EPA believes the current method of calculating 10-year time-weighted averages
by averaging two 5-year concentrations (including the maximum concentration and the highest adjacent 5-year value
calculated from each model run) is an appropriate approach for estimating lifetime individual risk and the Agency
selected this approach to be conservative and protective of human health. The 30-year exposure duration scenario
uses a time-weighted 30-year average concentration that includes the maximum concentration. Population risk estimates
aggregated over 70 years were based on a time-weighted 70-year average concentration that includes the maximum concentration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter believed that the source concentration used by EPA for PCP in the ground-water ingestion scenario was
too high because PCP is no longer in use and, thus, the infiltration to ground water would be reduced. The commenter
suggested that source reduction also would occur from erosion of surface soil containing PCP, before it is leached
and enters the ground water. EPA addressed the fact that PCP is no longer in use at most facilities in its baseline risk
estimates in the proposed rule, which have been revised in the final rule based on comments received to reflect source
concentrations and pulse durations (estimated time in which pentachlorophenate is expected to be present in substitute
wood surface protection product from time of changeover) more representative of the cross-contamination scenario.
While surface runoff and erosion may reduce the amount of PCP available for leaching to ground water, EPA has assumed,
for the purpose of its analysis, that any reductions are negligible. The EPA adopted this conservative assumption
mainly because of lack of data necessary to quantify such a loss and its effects on ground-water concentrations. Furthermore,
EPA does not believe that surface water and erosion will significantly reduce source leachate concentrations. As
formulation drips onto the soil it will rapidly penetrate the soil until the soil is saturated. Subsequent rain events
may wash off contaminated surface soil, but will not erode deeper soil horizons where most of the contaminant mass
resides. Thus, EPA does not consider this assumption to be overly conservative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that the results of the ground-water analysis were not supported by actual resource damage data.
The Agency does not expect, nor does it feel that it is needed, that ground water PCP concentrations predicted by MULTIMED
would agree precisely with the resource damage data. The resource damage incidents presented in the background document
are intended to illustrate that ground-water contamination from PCP does occur at sawmill facilities, and are not
intended as validation points for exposure modeling. Resource damage data were obtained from monitoring and other
wells that happened to be in place at a facility when the sampling was conducted. There are a number of possible reasons
why sampling data from the resource damage incidents may not reflect well-water concentrations predicted by the
model, in particular the location of the wells with regard to plume centerline and ground-water flow direction, and
the timing of peak plume concentrations at the wells. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The latter point is especially important because, depending on patterns of past PCP use and the well location, the
peak concentration in the plume may not have reached or may have passed the well(s) sampled. In these resource damage
cases, sufficient information was not available to determine the placement and design of these wells with respect
to the site's hydrogeology or possible plume locations and travel time. Thus, it is not possible to use these data points
for validation of model results. However, it should be noted that the model-estimated ground-water PCP concentrations
in the final rule are similar to those reported from resource damage incidents. When the revised average source concentration
was used in the ground-water model, the estimated concentrations for PCP in ground water (average = 0 .005 mg/L; high-end
= 288 mg/L) are in a reasonable agreement with the values reported in the resource damage accounts (&lt;0.001 to 45
mg/L). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter disagreed with the use of MULTIMED in that it was not as ``robust'' or well-tested as the Monte Carlo-based
EPACML model used for the TC rule. Another commenter recommends the use of the Monte Carlo approach for all input parameters
in the modeling effort. First, it is important to note that the MULTIMED ground-water model is the same model as used
in EPACML except for the manner in which input parameters are specified. EPACML can only be run in a probabilistic,
Monte Carlo mode, while MULTIMED allows Monte Carlo runs as well as for individual input parameters to be specified
and fixed. The ground-water flow and transport model components are the same for MULTIMED and EPACML. Second, the
Agency did not pursue a probabilistic, Monte Carlo-based approach when developing input parameters for this modeling
effort due to the fact that using this sophisticated technique requires knowledge and proper specification of input
parameter distributions, and variable independence or proper specification of joint probability parameter distributions.
When these requirements cannot be met, the Monte Carlo approach will not provide better estimates than a scenario-based
approach.

EPA has adopted a scenario-based regional modeling approach that uses input parameters developed for regions of
the U.S. where sawmills are more prevalent. In this approach, EPA uses average and high-end values for estimating
model input parameters on a regional basis because information does not exist on the actual means and distributions
of these parameters for the regions modeled. The Agency believes that this approach is an appropriate one and, furthermore,
that the resulting model estimates bracket or bound the uncertainty associated with the model input parameters.

Two commenters questioned the use of cancer as the endpoint of concern for 2,3,7,8-TCDD. EPA disagrees. The cancer
endpoint for TCDD was selected because it is the most sensitive endpoint for which qualitative dose response data
are available. 2,3,7,8-TCDD has been demonstrated to be a potent carcinogen in animals and has been classified as
a B2 (potential human) carcinogen. Recently published epidemiological studies of occupationally exposed individuals
report significant increases in cancer mortality. 2,3,7,8-TCDD also has potent reproductive and teratogenic endpoints
and enough data exist to estimate a reference dose (RfD) based on these alternative short-term effects. (For a detailed
discussion of this information, and for references to studies supporting these conclusions, the reader is referred
to the background document of the proposed rule.) However, if health-based levels (HBLs) are calculated using the
reproductive effect RfD, the exposure level is an order of magnitude higher than the level calculated using the carcinogen
slope factor (CSF). Thus, if the cancer end-point is used as the basis for calculating a permissible exposure level,
it also will be protective against short-term exposures such as those associated with reproductive effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of 2,3,7,8-TCDD toxicity is being reassessed by EPA (outside the framework of this rulemaking) and all endpoints
are being considered. TCDD has been observed to express a wide variety of effects including teratogenesis, reproductive
effects, and suppression of the immune system function in many species. Mechanistic approaches to understanding
and identifying toxic effects levels are also being considered. Until the reassessment process has been completed,
the EPA will continue to use the current carcinogenicity endpoint CSF value that has been accepted as the basis for
the MCL.

Two commenters noted limitations associated with the use of the Toxicity Equivalence Factors (TEF's) methodology.
They argued that the TEF methodology should not be used to justify the addition of appendix VIII in the absence of valid
toxicological studies that demonstrate actual health effects associated with exposure to these compounds. One
commenter questioned the proposal to add Octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) and Octachlorodibenzofuran (OCDF)
to 40 CFR part 261, appendix VIII. The commenters stated that neither compound has been shown to produce toxic, carcinogenic,
mutagenic or teratogenic effects on humans or other life forms. The Agency has decided not to add, at this time, OCDD
and OCDF to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. Although the original basis for including these congeners on appendix
VIII remains valid (details of which can be found in the background document supporting this final rulemaking), the
Agency is investigating further the information submitted by the commenters regarding the effects of OCDD and OCDF
reported in the Couture, Elwell, and Birnbaum study used to support the decisions made in the ``Interim Procedures
for Estimating Risks Associated with Exposures of Mixtures of Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins and Dibenzofurans
and the 1989 Update''. OCDD and OCDF are the most prevalent of the PCDD and PCDF congeners accounting for approximately
85 percent of the total CDD and CDF present in five of the six storage yard soil samples. OCDD has been shown to exhibit
``dioxin-like'' toxicity in male rats when administered in small doses in a sub-chronic toxicity study.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 These findings have been confirmed by a second sub-chronic study conducted in female rats.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 OCDD and OCDF have not exhibited toxicity in short term studies; however, acute exposure is not the only concern of
EPA. The Agency is currently re-evaluating its original assessment of risks from dioxin. At this point, the Agency
wishes to conclude its on-going reassessment before adding OCDD and OCDF to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261.

One commenter questioned the conclusion that soil contamination presents no risk to wildlife. The EPA recognizes
that concentrations that are protective of human health may not necessarily always be protective of wildlife. However,
in view of the relatively small areas occupied by sawmills and the low concentration of TCDD&hyph;TEQ in storage yard
soil from cross contamination, the EPA believes the incremental risks to wildlife will be below a level of concern.

VI of this preamble. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule also adds four chemicals to the list of hazardous constituents at 40 CFR part 261, appendix VIII. These
four chemicals are: (1) Sodium pentachlorophenate, (2) potassium pentachlorophenate, (3) sodium tetrachlorophenate,
and (4) potassium tetrachlorophenate. A discussion of this action is found in part C of this section.

A. Basis for the Determination Not To List as Hazardous Wastes From Wood Surface Protection Operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed in the proposed rule, in making a hazardous waste listing determination, the Agency applies a ``weight-of-evidence''
approach. In doing this, the Agency examines the risks associated with all potential human health and environmental
exposure pathways, analyzes trends in the current industry, researches past damage incidents, as well as other factors
found in 40 CFR 261.11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon reviewing and responding to comments received on the proposed rule, the Agency has decided not to list as hazardous
wastes from the use of chlorophenolic formulations in the wood surface protection industry for several reasons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, chlorophenolic formulations are no longer being produced in the United States and the Agency believes it is
very unlikely they will be produced in the future. The only remaining producer of chlorophenolics in the U.S., Chapman
Chemicals, stopped production in January of 1992 and sometime later applied for voluntary cancellation of its FIFRA
product registration. A notice describing this action was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 3, 1992 (57 FR 23401), and a final cancellation order was sent to Chapman Chemicals with an effective date of
September 14, 1992. This cancellation notice applies to the following products produced by Chapman Chemicals: Permatox
181, 10S, and 101, and Mitrol G-ST. Any manufacturer wishing to resume production of chlorophenolics would have to
obtain a new FIFRA registration before these chemicals could be re-introduced and made available for use in wood surface
protection. Currently, there remains only one known user of chlorophenolics in the U.S. out of an estimated 1000 previous
users and the remaining plant's existing stock is believed to be very limited. A major element in the decision not to
list as hazardous chlorophenolic wastes generated from the surface protection industry is the fact that use of chlorophenolic
formulations has ceased. EPA believes it is highly unlikely that a manufacturer will seek reregistration for this
product for many reasons, including the availability of effective substitute products and the potentially high
financial and administrative burdens imposed by the FIFRA registration process. Additional justification to support
non-future production is the fact that European countries do not want to accept dioxin-containing wood products
which have affected large export mills who will not use chlorophenolic formulations in the future in part for this
reason. Use of chlorophenolics for surface protection has declined steadily (even without the influence of RCRA)
from over 1,000 users to one user over the past decade. Should a new registration of this product be sought, EPA will
consider this surface protection risk analysis for full strength application when determining whether a new listing
determination under RCRA should be initiated. Currently, the Agency is aware of nine available substitute products
currently being used by surface protectors in place of chlorophenolics. The substitute products are for a large part
satisfactory to their users (as mentioned on various site trips), and the Agency does not feel as though a switch back
to chlorophenolics is likely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A second reason why the Agency has decided not to list these wastes is because the risk to human health and the environment
from on-going operations which previously used chlorophenolics is shown to tail off quickly because chlorophenolic
concentrations diminish to a near zero concentration within a short period of time following switchover to an alternate
product. The Agency has determined that the use of full-strength chlorophenolic formulations generates wastes
that result in unacceptable risk to human health and the environment. As before mentioned, should the use of chlorophenolics
for surface protection applications resume, for any reason, the Agency will most likely re-evaluate its current
position. However, dealing with the current situation, there remains only one known user of chlorophenolics with
a limited supply remaining. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Agency believes the use of full-strength chlorophenolics will be phased out in the very near future,
there was concern at the time of proposal that there may be unacceptable risks posed by the use of substitute products
that become cross-contaminated from previous chlorophenolic use. Particularly, the proposal cited possible ground
water risks of 2&times;10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for individuals and a broad but very low potential exposure risk due to surface run-off contributing to dioxin levels
in fish. The Agency received several comments addressing these potential impacts. In response to these comments,
the Agency conducted additional ground-water modeling using new pulse assumptions developed from commenter-submitted
information. The Agency developed what it believed to be better pulse assumptions in an effort to determine how long
pentachlorophenate will be present in on-going operations which have switched over from its past use. This new data
was obtained from performing mass balance iterations using typical tank volumes found at both large and small facilities.
These mathematical calculations showed that cross-contamination from previous use of chlorophenolics will be
present in a substitute products for only two to six years from the time a plant stops using chlorophenolics. The Agency
found that the highest estimated risk to an individual from drinking ground water for nine years at peak concentrations
in the two- or six-year pulse resulting from cross contamination, is significantly diminished and the broad effect
on dioxin levels in fish is reduced by several orders of magnitude. This new analysis shows that the risks associated
with cross-contamination do not justify a hazardous waste listing to capture cross-contaminated wastes. In the
proposed rule, EPA addressed the fact that PCP is no longer in use at most facilities in its baseline risk estimates,
which have been revised in the final rule to reflect source concentrations and pulse durations more representative
of the cross-contamination, incremental-risk scenario. Chart 1 below compares the incremental risks from cross-contaminated
wastes as calculated for the proposed rule to the values obtained using the new approach.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As shown in Chart 1, population risk is lower than that presented in the proposal for both fish/shellfish consumption
and the soil ingestion pathway, due to a unit conversion error in expressing dioxin concentration. The dioxin concentrations
in the formulation at one of the affected facilities (Aquasco, MD) were reported using incorrect units, causing a
1,000-fold error to be incorporated into the risk estimates for the fish and shellfish ingestion and soil ingestion
scenarios. When this error was corrected, the TCDD-TEQ levels used as the source concentration for affected facilities
(cross-contamination from past use of chlorophenolic formulations) and used in the lifetime individual risk estimates
for the soil/fish and shellfish ingestion scenarios also were reduced 1,000-fold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incremental population risk was revised for the ground-water scenario from an original 0.005 value to between
0.007 and 0.02 cancer cases. This range of 0.007 to 0.02 cancer cases was obtained because two different modelling
scenarios were run to generate the extremes of this range. One model run used input parameters which would simulate
decay for a small production plant. The input information was obtained from a mass balance iteration which showed
that it would take a small plant approximately 6 years to decrease cross-contamination levels to near zero; likewise,
the second model used input parameters for large facilities which predicted a two year decline to near zero levels
of cross-contamination. The details of the mass balance approach and the resulting change in population risk can
be found in the background document for this final rule. The Agency believes that these revised risk levels do not warrant
a hazardous waste listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above two main factors (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) chlorophenolic production stoppage and subsequent chlorophenolic use decline and (2) revised risk due to cross
contamination), the Agency looked closely at any potential environmental benefits that may accrue from a hazardous
waste listing. Given the market trend, the Agency cannot identify any tangible benefits to be gained from listing
wastes generated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations for wood surface protection. Environmental damages
caused by previous use of chlorophenolics have already occurred. A listing of these wastes cannot mitigate past damages
nor can it force the clean-up of these damages. Such potential jurisdiction exists under current programs. Authority
under CERCLA and RCRA 3007 exists even if a decision is made not to list as is the case for this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Damage to the environment of this magnitude from previous use of chlorophenolic formulations within this industry
are not expected to occur in the future unless use of full-strength chlorophenolics resumes. Furthermore, sampling
data collected at surface protection sites indicate that dioxin concentrations in storage yards (the largest area
of a plant) are below 1 ppb. The heavier contamination that occurs in the process area is confined to a small area and
likely will not migrate off-site to environmental receptors. Therefore, the Agency finds that the risks posed by
this residual contamination are limited and that a hazardous waste listing would likely simply result in these limited
areas of contamination being left in place and not produce an environmental benefit. Thus the effect on past contamination
does not justify a hazardous waste listing.

B. Operating Requirements for Surface Protection Plants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Agency is not listing F033 wastes, the operating standards for surface protection plants proposed in
the April 27, 1993 notice are not applicable and, thus, are not being finalized. Furthermore, surface protection
plants are not required to follow any specific waste management requirements regarding previous use of chlorophenolics
as a result of this rule.

C. Addition of Chemicals to Appendix VIII of 40 CFR Part 261 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this final rule does not list any wastes from wood surface protection processes as hazardous, the Agency
believes that certain constituents contained in these wastes warrant inclusion in appendix VIII of part 261. 40 CFR
261.11 provides that ``[s]ubstances will be listed on appendix VIII only if they have been shown in scientific studies
to have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogenic effects on humans or other life forms.'' In the April 27 notice,
EPA proposed to add six hazardous constituents of concern found in surface protection wastes to appendix VIII of 40
CFR part 261. Based on the information gathered during this listing investigation, the following four are being added
to the list: sodium pentachlorophenate, potassium pentachlorophenate, the sodium salt of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol,
and the potassium salt of 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol. The Agency presented information in the proposed rule and
supporting background documents on the adverse effects of these compounds. For those reasons, EPA is finalizing
the addition of four of these constituents to appendix VIII of part 261. The Agency is not at this time finalizing the
addition of OCDD and OCDF to Appendix VIII. As mentioned before, the Agency is investigating further the information
submitted by the commenters regarding the effects of OCDD and OCDF reported in the Couture, Elwell, and Birnbaum study
used to support the decisions made in the ``Interim Procedures for Estimating Risks Associated with Exposures of
Mixtures of Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins and Dibenzofurans and the 1989 Update''.

VI. Amendment of SW&hyph;846 (Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Agency proposed to add Method 4010 (Immunoassay Test for the Presence of
Pentachlorophenate) to the Second and Third Editions of SW&hyph;846. The purpose behind this proposal was to aid
owners/operators of wood surface protection plants with the proposed formulation testing requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to requiring the use of SW&hyph;846 methods for testing for the presence of pentachlorophenate in wood
surface protection ``in-process'' formulation, the issue is moot since EPA is not listing any wood surface protection
wastes as hazardous. Nonetheless, EPA believes that although no comments were received on Method 4010, Method 4010
is an appropriate method, in general, for testing for the presence of pentachlorophenate or pentachlorophenol and
can, therefore, be used in other applications other than for wood surface protection formulation testing. The Agency
is, therefore, adding Method 4010 to the Third Edition of SW&hyph;846 as Update IIA. We are not adding Method 4010 to
the Second Edition of SW&hyph;846 since the Third Edition has replaced the Second Edition on August 31, 1993 for use
in mandatory applications (58 FR 46040). Method 4010, including its protocol and documentation supporting this
action can be found in the docket for this rulemaking. See the ``For Further Information'' Section in front of this
preamble for the EPA contact person for further information or with questions on Method 4010.

VII. Pollution Prevention and Waste Minimization
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is preparing a separate guidance manual recommending voluntary pollution prevention and waste minimization
techniques for the lumber industry. Since it has studied the surface protection industry in making a listing determination
for wastes generated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations, EPA has gained a broad perspective on the best ways
to reduce wastes generated by this wood surface protection industry. The ideas gained from the study are presented
in this manual. Some recommended strategies for pollution prevention in the surface protection industry are described
in this section. Further information can be found in the manual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ultimate goal of pollution prevention is to reduce present and future threats to human health and the environment.
Pollution prevention (also referred to as source reduction) is the use of materials, processes, or practices that
reduce or eliminate the quantity and/or toxicity of wastes at the source of generation. Pollution prevention is the
first step in a hierarchy of options for reducing the generation of waste. The first recommended pollution prevention
option is to replace chemical treatment with another type of treatment to achieve surface protection. One alternate
is to dry the wood to reduce water content (high water content leads to sapstain). The Agency is aware that this option
may not be economically viable for a smaller mill. If such a system cannot be feasibly employed, it would be preferable
for a user of chlorophenolic-containing formulations to switch to an alternate formulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other pollution prevention strategies for use within the surface protection industry include: (1) Providing local
and general ventilation within the cutting process area to reduce dust that can accumulate on wood; (2) blowing wood
with air to reduce the amount of sawdust on wood prior to surface protection; and (3) using drainage collection devices
like gutters on rooftops to keep precipitation away from process wastes. The pollution prevention practices described
here can be critical to reduce the amount of waste generated. Although the Agency is not listing these chlorophenolic
wood surface protection wastes, the pollution prevention practices described in the guidance manual are applicable
to any waste generating process. For wastes that cannot be reduced at the source, generators may consider recycling
as the next best option.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal
governments or communities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Nevertheless, the Agency prepared an abbreviated RIA or ``Economic
Assessment'' (EA) in order to examine costs and benefits likely to occur as a result of that action.

B. Description of Costs and Benefits of This Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Agency has decided not to list wastes generated from the use of chlorophenolic formulations in surface
protection operations, no specific action is required under this Rule. Facilities, however, may choose to take some
remedial action as a result of publicity surrounding this action. A detailed analysis of work performed is described
in the background document for this final rule.

IX. State Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified States to administer and enforce the RCRA program within the
State. (See 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements for authorization.) Following authorization, EPA
retains enforcement authority under sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA, although authorized States have
primary enforcement responsibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA) amended RCRA, a State with final authorization administered
its hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of the Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements no longer
applied in the authorized State, and EPA could not issue permits for any plants located in the State with permitting
authorization. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or enacted, the State was obligated
to enact equivalent authority within specified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect in an authorized
State until the State adopted the requirements as State law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By contrast, under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by the HSWA
take effect in authorized States at the same time that they take effect in non-authorized States. EPA is directed to
implement those requirements and prohibitions in authorized States, including the issuance of permits, until the
State is granted authorization to do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain
final authorization, the Federal HSWA requirements apply in authorized States in the interim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this final rule does not list, as hazardous, chlorophenolic wastes from the wood surface protection industry,
it does add four constituents to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. These additions will not be effective in authorized
States since the requirements are not being imposed pursuant to HSWA. These requirements will be effective only in
those States that do not have final authorization. In authorized States, these requirements will not be applicable
until the States revise their programs to adopt equivalent requirements under State law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 271.21(e)(2) of EPA's state authorization regulations (40 CFR part 271) requires that States with final
authorization must modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and submit the modifications to EPA
for approval. The deadline by which the States must modify their programs to adopt this proposed regulation, if it
is adopted as a final rule, will be determined by the date of promulgation of a final rule in accordance with &sect; 271.21(e)(2).
If the proposal is adopted as a final rule, Table 1 at 40 CFR 271.1 will be amended accordingly. Once EPA approves the
modification, the State requirements become RCRA Subtitle C requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with authorized RCRA programs already may have regulations similar to what is being finalized in this rule.
These State regulations have not been assessed against the Federal regulations being proposed today to determine
whether they meet the tests for authorization. Thus, a State would not be authorized to implement these regulations
as RCRA requirements until State program modifications are submitted to EPA and approved, pursuant to 40 CFR 271.21.
Of course, States with existing regulations that are not less stringent than current Federal regulations may continue
to administer and enforce their regulations as a matter of State law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that authorized States are required to modify their programs only when EPA promulgates Federal
standards that are more stringent or broader in scope than existing Federal standards. Section 3009 of RCRA allows
States to impose standards more stringent than those in the Federal program. For those Federal program changes that
are less stringent or reduce the scope of the Federal program, States are not required to modify their programs. (See
40 CFR 271.1(i).) This proposed rule, if finalized, is neither less stringent than nor a reduction in the scope of the
current Federal program and, therefore, states would be required to modify their programs to retain authorization
to implement and enforce these regulations.

This final rule amends the hazardous waste regulations by adding four chemicals to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261
and amending SW&hyph;846 by adding Method 4010. These are impacts with negligible effects to small entities. Therefore,
there is no need to consider its impacts on small entities by preparing a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, enacted on August 10, 1993, established the Direct Loan Program under the Higher
Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). See subtitle A of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66).
Under the Direct Loan Program, loan capital is provided directly to student and parent borrowers by the Federal Government
rather than through private lenders. This program replaces the direct loan demonstration program that was authorized
to begin in July 1994 by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HEA directs the Secretary to consult with members of the higher education community and to publish a notice of standards,
criteria, and procedures for the program's first year in lieu of issuing regulations using the Department's usual
procedures. The Secretary's representatives participated in regional meetings at various locations around the
country in which members of the higher education community including representatives of colleges, universities,
proprietary schools, and educational associations were consulted. The Secretary's representatives have also
met with numerous national, regional, and state organizations representing the financial aid community to discuss
various aspects of the Direct Loan Program. The Secretary's representatives have met with personnel from schools
and financial advisors to assist in the development of the software that will be used by Direct Loan Program schools.
In addition, the notice is based in part on final regulations for the direct loan demonstration program in 34 CFR part
685 that were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 2, 1993 (58 FR 36088), following the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking and consideration of public
comment. The Secretary believes that participating schools' familiarity with those regulations will ease the burden
of their participation in the Direct Loan Program.

This notice establishes the policies and procedures necessary for schools to implement the Direct Loan Program and
most of the policies and procedures relating to borrowers in the Direct Loan Program. The Secretary anticipates publishing
another notice in the spring of 1994 to govern repayment of loans for the 1994&hyph;1995 academic year and establish
standards and procedures relating to Federal Direct Consolidation Loans.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 10, 1993, the Secretary published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 47816) soliciting applications from schools for participation in the Direct Loan Program. Over 1,100 schools
responded to that invitation. The Secretary selected 104 schools, representing approximately five percent (5%)
of the total Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL) loan volume, to participate in the Direct Loan Program for
the academic year beginning July 1, 1994. The rules in this notice are applicable for the period beginning July 1, 1994,
and ending June 30, 1995. As required by statute, program regulations for the Direct Loan Program in future years will
be developed through the use of a negotiated rulemaking process to the extent practicable.

II. Participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Schools may participate in the Direct Loan Program by originating loans directly, by participating in a consortium
of schools that originates loans directly, or by using an alternative originator to originate loans. All schools
are responsible for determining student eligibility for Direct Loan and disbursing loan proceeds to borrowers.
Some schools participate in the Direct Loan Program and the FFEL concurrently, while the rest of the selected schools
participate exclusively in the Direct Loan Program. Some of the schools that participate in both programs concurrently
make Direct Loans available to first time borrowers only; other schools make Direct Loans available to students studying
in certain divisions of the school and make FFEL loans available to their other students. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The standards and procedures in this notice are, unless otherwise noted, applicable to each participating school
regardless of its method or volume of participation. As stated in the notice announcing the selection of participating
schools for the 1994&hyph;95 academic year, a school may withdraw from participation within 30 days of the publication
of these standards, criteria, and procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Administrative Fee for Loan Origination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Schools and consortia that originate loans will be paid a fee to assist in meeting the costs of loan origination, including
the costs associated with drawing down the funds, maintaining the Direct Loan Program account, and reconciling cash
and individual loan records with the Secretary each month. The Secretary prefers that originating schools print
promissory note/disclosure statements on site. To assist in compensating for the costs associated with this function,
schools that print promissory notes/disclosure statements will be paid a larger fee than schools that do not print
promissory note/disclosure statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative fee is paid for borrowers for whom a first disbursement has been made and for whom the first disbursement
has been reconciled with the Secretary. For the 1994&hyph;1995 academic year, the program-wide average administrative
fee may not exceed $10 per borrower. The Secretary will notify schools that originate loans of the actual fee schedule
and payment procedures when they are determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This fee structure is applicable to the first year of the program only and is likely to be restructured through the negotiated
rulemaking process and when additional data are available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Making Direct Loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Beginning with the 1994&hyph;95 academic year, all student applications for Federal student aid, including Direct
Loans, will be processed by the Central Processor System (CPS). The school will receive an official output from the
CPS in the form of a Student Aid Report (SAR) or an Electronic Student Aid Report (ESAR). The ESAR output may be on tapes,
cartridges, or rosters. With this official output, the school will be able to assemble a financial aid award package.
A school participating in the Direct Loan Program may package Direct Loans as part of the financial aid package in the
same manner that a school participating in the FFEL Program packages FFEL Program loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A school in the Direct Loan Program will either originate loans or use the services for an alternative originator.
A school will use an alternative originator if it chooses not to originate loans or is not eligible to originate loans.
For the first year of the Direct Loan Program, the criteria for eligibility to originate were prescribed by statute.
These criteria were included in the September 10, 1993

A. Originating Schools 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Direct Loan Program, schools and consortia that originate loans must use software provided by the Secretary,
or other software based on specifications provided by the Secretary, to create a loan-origination record containing
the basic information necessary to make a loan. The software provided by the Secretary reformats the data received
from the CPS and prompts the school to add data collected by the school, such as the type of loan, loan amount, and disbursement
dates. Because schools have different needs, various options are available to schools after they generate the loan
origination record. The software allows schools to computer-generate combined promissory notes/disclosure statements.
Alternatively, a school could transmit the information collected by the school to the Direct Loan Program Servicer,
which upon request, will print promissory notes/disclosure statements on behalf of the school and ship them to the
school.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A student who accepts a Direct Loan completes a promissory note and returns it to the school; the school may not disburse
Direct Loan funds without a completed promissory note. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An originating school in the Direct Loan Program requests and obtains loan funds from the Secretary using a process
similar to the process for drawing down funds for other Department of Education (ED) programs. The Secretary adopted
this process to ease the burden on schools participating in the Direct Loan Program. The Direct Loan Program system,
however, differs from the systems used for other ED programs in two ways. First, a school transmits to ED a specific
Direct Loan funding request that is separate from its funding requests for other programs. Direct Loan capital must
be tracked separately and cannot be used for purposes other than making Direct Loans. The actual transmission request
and subsequent electronic transfer of funds uses the same delivery process as is used for the Federal Pell Grant Program.
After a request for funds is received, the Secretary uses the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) process through the Federal
Reserve Banking system to deposit funds in a school's designated bank account. Currently, this process takes between
48 to 72 hours from the school's request for funds until the school's receipt of funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second difference between the Direct Loan Program system and the system used for other ED programs is that the amount
of loan capital needed by the school is dependent on the eligibility of student and parent borrowers at the school.
Funds for the Direct Loan Program are not limited by Congressional appropriations. As a result, there is no need for
a maximum funding level to be authorized for a school in the Direct Loan Program. The Direct Loan system, however, incorporates
internal fund controls to monitor school drawdown requests; these controls will flag any requests that appear excessive.
The system also identifies schools that have failed to comply with program requirements. These flags result in immediate
inquiry and intervention by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The software provided by the Secretary computes gross disbursements, loan fees, and net disbursements on the basis
of the loan amounts entered by the school. A school requests the amount needed to fund net disbursements to borrowers.
The Secretary expects that schools will follow the guidelines for cash management set out in The Blue Book, which is
the manual of accounting, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for postsecondary educational institutions
under the federally-funded student financial aid programs. This notice requires any interest earned on funds drawn
down to be returned to the Secretary. For future years, the Secretary anticipates that issues related to fiscal control
and final accountability will be addressed in more detail in negotiated rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After receiving funds from the Secretary, a school disburses funds to students by crediting their accounts at the
school or by sending checks to the students. Before a school may disburse funds to a borrower, the school must ensure
that it has a completed and signed promissory note. After the first disbursement is made, the school must record the
actual disbursed amount and the date of each disbursement in the loan-origination record and transmit all completed
loan records and promissory notes to the Secretary. The school transmits subsequent disbursement data to the Secretary
as the disbursements occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A school is required to reconcile cash and individual loan records monthly. To reconcile cash, a school must provide
documentation that the total disbursement minus cancellations, plus return of excess cash, is equal to the amount
of money the school has drawn down during a one-month period by the end of the next month. For example, loan records and
promissory notes for all disbursements and cancellations made in July 1994 must be transmitted to the Secretary by
the end of August 1994. To reconcile loan records, a school's records must match the records of the Direct Loan Program
Servicer. The software that is provided to participating schools is designed to assist schools in this reconciliation
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Schools That Use an Alternative Originator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Schools that use an alternative originator transmit to the Direct Loan Program Servicer the data necessary for the
Direct Loan Program Servicer to generate the combined promissory note/disclosure statement unless the school chooses
to print the promissory note/disclosure statement on its premises. After the Direct Loan Program Servicer generates
the promissory note/disclosure statement, it is sent to the school or to the borrower depending upon the school's
established procedures. The borrower must complete the promissory note/disclosure statement and forward it as
instructed to the Direct Loan Program Servicer or to the school. The Direct Loan Program Servicer must review the promissory
note/disclosure statement before funds can be disbursed. If the Direct Loan Program Servicer or the school determines
that the promissory note/disclosure statement is not accurate or complete, the promissory note/disclosure statement
must be correct and complete before funds can be disbursed. The Direct Loan Program Servicer initiates drawdown of
funds to the school based on the completed promissory note/disclosure statement. The school also receives a roster
from the Direct Loan Program Servicer identifying each borrower, the disbursement date and amount to be disbursed
for each borrower, and the total amount of funds received by the school. Schools that use alternative origination
are still responsible for reporting actual disbursement data, reconciling cash, and returning funds that are not
used or for which the borrower is not eligible.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In short, the procedures used by a school that uses alternative origination differ in two ways from the procedures
of originating schools. The first is that a school under alternative origination may choose to designate the alternative
originator as the manager of promissory note/disclosure statements. The second is that a school under alternative
origination does not manage the funds draw down process; instead, the school receives funds drawn down by the alternative
originator only for those completed promissory notes in the possession of the alternative originator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary anticipates that issues related to participation of alternative originators in future years will
be subject to the negotiated rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Federal Direct PLUS Loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal Direct PLUS loans are made through a process similar to the one used in the Federal PLUS loan program. The parent
obtains a combined application/promissory note from the school and, after completing the combined application/promissory
note, sends it to the school. The school completes the school section of the application/promissory note and forwards
it to the Direct Loan Program Servicer where data from the note is key entered and a credit check is performed. Alternatively,
a school enters data from the note using the software provided by the Direct Loan Program Servicer and electronically
forwards this information to the Direct Loan Program Servicer. In either case, the Direct Loan Program Servicer performs
a credit check to determine, as required by section 428B(a) of the HEA, whether the parent has an adverse credit history
and notifies the school and the parent of the results. If the loan is approved, the Direct Loan Program Servicer sends
a disclosure statement to the parent. If the credit check indicates an adverse credit history, the Secretary advises
the parent of available options; for example, the parent could obtain an endorser without an adverse credit history.
If the loan is approved and the school originates loans, the school may draw down money and disburse loan funds in the
same manner as it would for other loans made under the Direct Loan Program. If the school does not originate loans, the
alternative originator electronically transmits the funding request for the school based on the application/promissory
notes that the Direct Loan Program Servicer holds for that school. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Loan Servicing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is responsible for servicing and collecting Direct Loans. As noted above, a notice specifically concerned
with repayment and collection will be published shortly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A school's interaction with the Direct Loan Program Servicer during the servicing and collection of the loan is similar
to the interaction schools currently have with lenders and guaranty agencies in the FFEL Program. Schools must respond
to periodic student status confirmation requests as well as to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ad hoc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requests for information regarding borrowers from the Direct Loan Program Servicer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Borrowers who default on Direct Loans are added to ED's debt collection system and are subject to all legally authorized
default-collection activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Impact of Other Rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the provisions of the FFEL Program that are applicable to the Direct Loan Program have been incorporated into
this notice of standards, criteria, and procedures. The Secretary adopted those provisions because schools are
familiar with them from their participation in the FFEL Program. Certain policies and procedures currently being
developed through negotiated rulemaking for FFEL Program regulations will be adopted in the Direct Loan Program,
including policies relating to borrower forgiveness for students who attended schools that have closed or whose
eligibility was falsely certified and policies controlling the deferment for economic hardship.

B. Subpart B_Borrower Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart B contains conditions of borrower eligibility, which are identical to the borrower eligibility provisions
in the FFEL Program. The charges for which borrowers are responsible, loan limits, deferment and forbearance options,
and borrower defenses to repayment are also included. The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993 eliminated the Federal Supplemental
Loans for Students (SLS) program but increased the loan limits for the Unsubsidized Stafford Program beginning July
1, 1994. The Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1993 further revised the loan limits. The revised loan limits
are included in this notice along with a chart (Appendix A) which illustrates the loan limits that will be applicable
as of July 1, 1994.

C. Subpart C_Requirements, Standards, and Payments for Schools in the Direct Loan Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart C contains those provisions governing a school's participation in the Direct Loan Program, including disbursement
procedures, entrance and exit counseling, withdrawal procedures, recordkeeping and funds control requirements.
The Secretary anticipates that schools will continue with the conscientious efforts demonstrated in the FFEL Program
in tailoring the counseling to the borrower's particular needs and making counseling accessible. These efforts
have included, for example, sign language interpreters for hearing impaired borrowers or translations for limited
English proficient borrowers.

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The contents of this notice have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order,
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of the standards, criteria, and procedures in this notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the contents of this notice are those resulting from statutory requirements
and those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently.
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these standards, criteria,
and procedures, the Secretary has determined that the benefits of these standards, criteria, and procedures justify
the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that the contents of this notice do not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The contents of this notice are consistent with the requirements of the HEA and promote the President's priorities.

Waiver of Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties an opportunity to comment on proposed regulations.
However, Public Law 103&hyph;66 requires that the Secretary publish a notice in lieu of regulations for the first
year of the Direct Loan Program and exempts the contents of the notice from the rulemaking requirements of section
431 of the General Education Provisions Act. While the Secretary has consulted with members of the higher education
community in the development of this notice, the statutory timeframe for the program does not permit the solicitation
of further public comment. A public comment period, while helpful, would seriously delay the provision of necessary
guidance for the operation of the Direct Loan Program. Therefore, the Secretary finds that solicitation of public
comments would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B).

. In the case of a dependent graduate student, the total amount the student may borrow for any period of study for the
Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program and Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program is the same as

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In addition to any amount borrowed under paragraph (b), an independent undergraduate student, graduate or professional
student, or certain dependent undergraduate students may borrow additional amounts under the Federal Direct Unsubsidized
Loan Program. In order for a dependent undergraduate student to receive this additional loan amount, the financial
aid administrator must determine and document in the school's file, after review of the family financial information
provided by the student and consideration of the student's debt burden, that the student's parents likely will be
precluded by exceptional circumstances (e.g., the student's parent receives only public assistance or disability
benefits, is incarcerated, has an adverse credit history, or his or her whereabouts are unknown) from borrowing under
the Federal Direct PLUS Program or the Federal PLUS Program and the student's family is otherwise unable to provide
the student's expected family contribution. A parent's refusal to borrow a Federal PLUS loan or Federal Direct PLUS
loan does not constitute an exceptional circumstance. The additional amount that such a student may borrow under
the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan Program, in combination with Federal Unsubsidized Stafford loans,
for any academic year of study is_

than a borrower who is serving in a medical or dental internship or residency described in paragraph (i)(1) of this
section), the Secretary grants forbearance in increments of up to one year, for periods that, collectively, do not
exceed three years, if the borrower or endorser_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Is currently obligated to make payments on Title IV loans; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The amount of such payments each month (or a proportional share if the payments are due less frequently than monthly)
is collectively equal to or greater than 20 percent of the borrower or endorser's monthly disposable income.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section establishes rules for how a school shall determine the withdrawal date for a student to whom or on whose
behalf a loan has been made under this part for the purpose of reporting to the Secretary the date that the student has
withdrawn from the school and for determining when a refund must be paid under &sect;685.305. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The withdrawal date
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the student's withdrawal date is the earlier
of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The date the student notifies the school of the student's withdrawal or the date of withdrawal specified by the
student, whichever is later; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The date of withdrawal as determined by the school. The school must determine the student's date of withdrawal
no later than_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Forty-five days after the expiration date of the academic term in which the student was enrolled for a school that
uses academic terms (e.g., semester, trimester, or quarter), except that 30 days after the first day of the next scheduled
term may be used in the case of a summer break; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Twenty-five days after a student's last date of attendance for a school that measures academic progress either
in clock hours or credit hours but does not use a semester, trimester, or quarter system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the student has not returned to school at the expiration of a leave of absence approved under paragraph (c) of
this section, the student's withdrawal date is the first day of the leave of absence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the student is enrolled in a program of study by correspondence, the student's withdrawal date is the date of
the last lesson submitted if the student fails to submit the next scheduled lesson in accordance with the schedule
of lessons established under &sect;685.302. However, if the student establishes in writing, within 60 days of the
date of the last lesson submitted, a desire to continue in the program and an understanding that the required lessons
must be submitted on time, the school may restore that student to in-school status for purposes of the loan made under
this part. The school may not grant the student more than one restoration to in-school status on this basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For the purpose of a school's reporting to the Secretary, a student's withdrawal date is the month, day, and year
of the withdrawal date determined under paragraphs (b)(1)&hyph;(b)(3) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Leaves of absence
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A student who has been absent from school and has been granted a leave of absence by a school in accordance with this
paragraph is not considered to have withdrawn from school for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section. In any 12-month
period, a school may grant no more than a single leave of absence to a student, provided that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The student has made a written request to be granted a leave of absence; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The leave of absence involves no additional charges by the school to the student; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The leave of absence does not exceed_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Sixty days; or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The school is not a correspondence school and the school's next period of enrollment after the start of the leave
of absence would begin more than 60 days after the first day of the leave of absence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

student must provide the school with a written recommendation from a physician for a leave of absence longer than 60
days.

Accounting requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A school shall establish and maintain on a current basis financial records that reflect all transactions for the bank
account specified in paragraph (h)(1). The school shall establish and maintain general ledger control accounts
and related subsidiary accounts that identify each program transaction and separate those transactions from all
of the school's other financial activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The school shall account for receiving and expending Direct Loan Program funds in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h)(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Direct Loan Program bank account. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The school shall establish and maintain a bank account as trustee for the Secretary and the borrower for Direct Loan
Program funds. The school shall notify the bank where the Direct Loan Program account is located in writing that the
Direct Loan Program account contains Federal funds. In addition, the school must provide that the word ``Federal''
is in the name of the school's Direct Loan Program account. If the school's accounting system and practices meet the
requirements of paragraph (g) of this section, the school's Direct Loan Program account need not be a separate bank
account. The Secretary reserves the right to require a school to maintain a separate account for the Direct Loan Program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Any interest earned on Direct Loan Program funds deposited in the school's account is considered Federal funds
and must be returned to the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A school shall divide the functions of authorizing payments and disbursing funds to borrowers so that no single
office has responsibility for both functions under the Direct Loan Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Funds received by a school under this part may be used only to make Direct Loan Program loans to eligible borrowers
and may not be used or hypothecated for any other purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) The Secretary may take any action that he deems appropriate to protect the Federal fiscal interest, including
such actions as requiring that a school that originates Direct Loans use an alternative originator instead.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulatory action is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. The
Administrator of REA has determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) does not apply to this rule. The Administrator of REA has determined that this rule will not significantly affect
the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. Section 1710.117 requires
borrowers to comply with applicable environmental regulations and will cover the activities for which assistance
is sought under this subpart. This rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation,
which may require consultation with State and local officials. A Notice of Final Rule titled Department Programs
and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts REA electric loans and loan guarantees from
coverage under this Order. This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule:
(1) Will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict
with this rule; (2) will not have any retroactive effect; (3) will not require administrative proceedings before
any parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule. The program described by this rule is listed in the
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under number 10.850 Rural Electrification Loans and Loan Guarantees.
This catalog is available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, the United States Government
Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9325. The existing recordkeeping and reporting burdens contained
in this rule were approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980
(44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->

), under control numbers 0572&hyph;0017, 0572&hyph;0032 and 0572&hyph;0103. Because of the deadline imposed by
the law, the additional recordkeeping and reporting burdens have been submitted to OMB for approval on an emergency
basis. Send questions or comments regarding these burdens or any other aspect of these collections of information,
including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rural Electrification Loan Restructuring Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;129, 107 Stat. 1356, (RELRA), signed
into law by President Clinton on November 1, 1993, amends the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, 7 U.S.C. 901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(RE Act). The amendments mandate a restructuring of the electric loan programs of REA. Loan purposes, the definition
of ``rural area'', applicable interest rates and loan terms and conditions were among the areas affected by RELRA.
An interim rule implementing these provisions of RELRA were published on December 20, 1993 at 58 FR 66260.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to 7 CFR part 1710, published today implement the provision for making loans for demand side management,
energy conservation programs, on- and off-grid renewable energy systems. This provision has a statutory deadline
of January 1, 1994.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Demand side management has become increasingly important to electric utilities as they seek ways to make their existing
systems more efficient and reduce the need for new capacity. REA has supported demand side management (DSM) activities
in the form of direct load control and energy conservation through loans for control equipment and principal deferment
programs for energy conservation. With the passage of RELRA, REA is authorized to expand its role and make loans for
all types of demand side management activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This authority will be used primarily to finance distribution borrower needs. REA believes that most DSM activities
must be conducted at the distribution level because DSM impacts the consumer's use of electricity. Power supply borrowers
are eligible for this financing assistance, but the level of investment required to support their distribution members
in this area is not normally expected to require loan funds. REA will not make DSM loans or any type of loans directly
to individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be eligible for a loan for DSM programs, which include energy conservation programs (except those financed by loan
principal deferments), and for on-grid renewable energy systems, the loan request must be supported by an REA-approved
integrated resource plan (IRP). REA may also require an IRP, on a case by case basis, for certain large or unusual loans
for off-grid renewable energy systems. DSM programs must also be supported by DSM plan, which must be consistent with
the borrower's IRP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As defined by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;486) (EP Act), an integrated resource plan is ``a planning
and selection process for new energy resources that evaluates the full range of alternatives, including new generation
capacity, power purchases, energy conservation and efficiency, cogeneration and district heating and cooling
applications, and renewable energy sources, in order to provide adequate and reliable service at the lowest system
cost. The process shall take into account necessary features for system operation, such as diversity, reliability,
dispatchability, and other factors of risk and shall take into account the ability to verify energy savings achieved
through energy conservation and efficiency and the projected durability of such savings measured over time; and
shall treat demand and supply side resources on a consistent and integrated basis.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the regulatory text, the term ``IRP'' is used to refer to the result of the process rather than the process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EP Act also defines the term ``system cost'' to mean ``all direct and quantifiable net costs for an energy resource
over its available life, including the cost of production, distribution, transportation, utilization, waste management,
and environmental compliance.''

This subpart establishes policies and requirements for IRPs and DSM plans. Many of these requirements are new, although
existing &sect;&sect;1710.253 and 1710.254, and existing subparts E and G, set forth analytical and related requirements
for the financing of most generation facilities that are the same in many respects to the requirements of an IRP. Given
the expansion of REA lending authority in the relatively new and sometimes uncertain areas of DSM and renewable energy
systems, it is essential that borrowers make their investment decisions based on an IRP in order to ensure informed
and prudent investment planning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a distribution borrower is a member of a power supply borrower, its requests for DSM loans must be based on and be consistent
with the IRP of the power supply borrower. The IRP of the power supply borrower will establish which DSM programs, on-grid
renewable energy systems, and traditional utility investments, among several feasible alternatives, are most
cost-beneficial from the standpoint of the power supply borrower and its members taken as an integrated system. The
DSM programs of the individual distribution members must be coordinated among all parties to ensure that the DSM programs
of one member do not jeopardize the financial integrity and loan security of any other member or that of the power supply
borrower.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although DSM must be implemented at the distribution level, a significant portion of the benefits and costs of DSM
are accrued at the power supply level. These benefits and costs are then transferred to the distribution borrower
through wholesale rates. Consequently, DSM planning by distribution borrowers must consider the impacts of their
activities on their power supplier and the implications of the power supplier's wholesale rates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the relationship between a power supply borrower and its members and the relationship among the members
of a power supply borrower, it is imperative that the power supply borrower and its members coordinate IRP activities
per &sect;1710.356(b)(1) of this interim rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a distribution borrower is not a member of a power supply borrower, loan requests for DSM programs and on-grid renewable
energy systems must be supported by the borrower's own IRP. The IRP must address, in particular, any effects its DSM
programs will have on the wholesale power rates charged by its non-REA financed power supplier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements set forth for DSM plans and IRPs are intended to provide guidance as these new requirements are implemented.
Since these areas are new in many respects, REA intends to exercise its discretion to administer the specific requirements
and procedures with a prudent degree of flexibility, especially during the first several months of implementation.
Comments from the public are invited regarding the policies and requirements set forth herein for DSM plans and IRPs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule includes citations to studies of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the U.S. Department of
Energy which are included as reader aids and do not imply REA adoption or endorsement of said studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim regulation will define DSM and renewable energy systems. It will also emphasize REA commitment to finance
nontraditional (renewables, DSM and energy conservation systems) and traditional resources on an equal footing.
Borrowers requesting loans under this subpart will be required to submit an IRP and a DSM plan in most cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Loans under this subsection for facilities to be owned and operated by the borrower will generally be treated like
loans for usual electric facilities. Loans for other purposes will be considered as operational loans with terms
based on the borrower's program cycle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until REA has developed experience in making loans for these new purposes, cumulative loans for DSM and for energy
conservation programs will be limited to an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the borrower's equity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (DSM) means the deliberate planning and/or implementation of activities to influence consumer use of electricity
provided by a distribution borrower to produce beneficial modifications to the system load profile. Beneficial
modifications to the system load profile ordinarily improve load factor or otherwise help in utilizing electric
system resources to best advantage consistent with acceptable standards of service and lowest system cost. Load
profile modifications are characterized as peak clipping, valley filling, load shifting, strategic conservation,
strategic load growth, and flexible load profile. (See, for example, publications of the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI), 3412 Hillview Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, especially ``Demand-Side Management Glossary'' EPRI
TR&hyph;101158, Project 1940&hyph;25, Final Report, October 1992.) DSM includes energy conservation programs.
It does not include sources of electrical energy such as renewable energy systems, fuel cells, or traditionally fueled
generation, such as fossil or nuclear fueled generators.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart sets forth REA policies and procedures with regard to loans and loan guarantees to REA borrowers for the
purpose of implementing their demand side management (DSM) plans, energy conservation programs, and on-grid and
off-grid renewable energy systems. The Administrator reserves the right to determine if loans for purposes under
this subpart will be made to a borrower in default under its mortgage and loan contract. As is the case with all other
REA loans, loans for purposes under this subpart will not be made to individuals.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Off-grid renewable energy systems will be considered the same as DSM activities and will qualify for either insured
loans or loan guarantees pursuant to &sect;1710.102.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) On-grid renewable energy systems will be treated as a generation resource and will be eligible only for loan guarantees
pursuant to &sect;1710.102. Existing REA policy with respect to generation resources shall generally apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) REA loans for renewable energy systems will be made only for systems utilizing technologies that are proven and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) REA will make loans for the purpose of assisting electric borrowers to implement REA approved demand side management
plans. For the purposes of this regulation energy conservation programs are included as a DSM activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) REA will treat demand-side and supply-side resources on an equal basis. All requirements applicable to loans
for traditional electric facilities will apply to loans for DSM. In addition the requirements set forth in this subpart
will apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) DSM will be considered a distribution loan purpose, eligible for either insured loans or loan guarantees pursuant
to &sect;1710.102.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) REA will conduct its own evaluation, as specified in this subpart, of a borrower's DSM activities before making
a determination on the disposition of a borrower's loan application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) REA loans for DSM activities will be made only for systems utilizing technologies that are proven and commercially
available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) In general, REA will require pilot project testing of DSM activities new to the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) If the borrower's IRP, DSM plan, project construction and/or financing, and/or rate recovery is subject to the
approval of state authorities, the borrower must obtain such approvals before REA will approve a loan for any purpose
for which an REA approved DSM plan or IRP is required under this subpart.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Any loan application which includes funds for DSM must include all loan support documents required for a loan for
electric facilities, and must demonstrate that requirements for need, loan feasibility and loan security are satisfied.
In addition, the application must be supported by an REA approved IRP, except as provided in &sect;1710.356(a)(1),
and an REA approved DSM plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a)(1) An REA approved IRP is required for all loans that include funds for DSM activities, unless the cumulative total
of all previous DSM loans and the loan under consideration for that applicant is less than 1 percent of the applicant's
total utility plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An REA approved IRP is required for all loans that include funds for on-grid renewable energy systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An REA approved IRP is required for all loans that include funds for off-grid renewable energy systems unless the
Administrator determines that an IRP is not needed to determine that the loan is both feasible and secure pursuant
to &sect;&sect;1710.112 and 1710.113, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) When an IRP is required, a distribution borrower that is a member of a power supply borrower must use the IRP prepared
by the power supply borrower for its overall system. This IRP must have been coordinated with all of the member systems
and it must have been approved by the board of directors of the power supply borrower. Because of the relationship between
the power supply borrower and its members under which the loans incurred by the power supply borrower are primarily
to construct, improve or acquire facilities that benefit all members directly or indirectly, the security of loans
to all parties is interlinked. Consequently, DSM activities and renewable energy activities must be coordinated
among all parties to insure that the activities of one member do not jeopardize the financial integrity or loan security
of any other member or that of the power supply borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A distribution system that is not a member of an REA financed power supply borrower shall prepare its own IRP. An
IRP developed by a distribution borrower that is not a member of a power supply borrower need only address its own system,
but shall include an analysis of the effects of its DSM activities on its wholesale power costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The IRP shall identify supply side and demand side options and analyze their benefits and costs in order to provide
adequate and reliable electric service to consumers at the lowest cost for the system as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The IRP shall include necessary features for system operation, such as diversity, reliability, dispatchability,
and other factors of risk; and it shall take into account the ability to verify energy and cost savings achieved through
DSM, energy conservation, and renewable energy systems, and the projected durability of such savings measured over
time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The following elements also included in a DSM plan, pursuant to &sect;&sect;1710.357 and 1710.358, shall be included
except where REA determines that they are not necessary: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Load shape objectives; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Wholesale power pricing policy and costs, and their relationship to the proposed DSM activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Ownership and costs of DSM related hardware; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Incentive and marketing costs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Communication and control costs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Monitoring methods and costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The IRP shall analyze the DSM effects set forth in &sect;1710.359.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A DSM plan approved by the borrower's board of directors is required in support of a loan that includes funds for
DSM activities or for off-grid renewable energy systems. The DSM plan shall address the borrower's existing and proposed
activities for the same period covered by the Long-Range Financial Forecast submitted in support of the loan application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(1) A DSM plan prepared by a member of a power supply borrower must be consistent with the IRP prepared by the power

(a) The borrower may have performed analysis and prepared comparable documentation for other purposes, such as for
a state regulatory commission. This information may be acceptable to REA as an IRP or a DSM plan if the borrower demonstrates
that the alternative information meets the goals and objectives of this subpart.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The borrower shall advise REA of all material information provided to other lenders or other governmental authorities
relating to their DSM plans. This information shall be provided to REA as requested.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The final maturity of loans for purposes under this subpart shall be determined by REA based on the expected life
of needed capital improvements, expected cost recovery periods, the expected life of program benefits, the certainty
of these benefits, and matching costs and benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) REA will normally consider final maturities for DSM loans of up to 5 years. Longer loan terms, not to exceed 10 years,
for loans for these purposes will be considered if the borrower can satisfactorily demonstrate to the Administrator
an acceptable basis for doing so and can demonstrate that the loan will be feasible and secure pursuant to &sect;&sect;1710.112
and 1710.113, respectively, for the longer period. As used in this paragraph, renewable energy resource equipment
and facilities are not considered a DSM purpose. Maturities for such loans will be limited to the expected useful life
of the equipment and facilities.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This hearing is being held to consider proposals to amend five Federal milk marketing orders. The proposals would
establish a multiple component pricing plan for pricing producer milk under the orders. Producer milk utilized in
Class II and Class III would be priced to handlers on the basis of three components. The components priced would be butterfat,
protein and solids-not-fat other than protein. Under some of the proposals, producer prices or protein prices would
be adjusted for quality attributes of milk, such as somatic cell content. The hearing was requested by a dairy trade
association and several cooperative associations that represent a substantial number of dairy farmers who supply
these markets. A number of other dairy cooperative associations and dairy organizations submitted proposals to
be considered at the hearing. The proponents maintain that the proposed payment plans would give producers a direct
economic incentive to produce the components valued by the marketplace.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This administrative action is governed by the provisions of Sections 556 and 557 of title 5 of the United States Code
and therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given of a public hearing to be held at the Sheraton Inn Airport, 2500 E. 79th Street, Bloomington,
Minnesota 55425 (telephone 612/854&hyph;1771), beginning at 9 a.m. on January 25, 1994, with respect to proposed
amendments to the tentative marketing agreements and to the orders regulating the handling of milk in the aforesaid
marketing areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearing is called pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7
U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing
agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part 900). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence with respect to the economic and marketing conditions which relate
to the proposed amendments, hereinafter set forth, and any appropriate modifications thereof, to the tentative
marketing agreements and to the orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Actions under the Federal milk order programs are subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354).
This Act seeks to ensure that, within the statutory authority of a program, the regulatory and information requirements
are tailored to the size and nature of small businesses. For the purpose of the Act, a dairy farm is a ``small business''
if it has an annual gross revenue of less than $500,000, and a dairy products manufacturer is a ``small business'' if
it has fewer than 500 employees. Most parties subject to a milk order are considered as a small business. Accordingly,
interested parties are invited to present evidence on the probable regulatory and informational impact of the hearing
proposals on small businesses. Also, parties may suggest modifications of these proposals for the purpose of tailoring
their applicability to small business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to the rules proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.
They are not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state
or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with these rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order,
any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law
and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for
a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district
courts of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business,
has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not
later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties who wish to introduce exhibits should provide the Presiding Officer at the hearing with 6 copies
of such exhibits for the Official Record. Also, it would be helpful if additional copies are available for the use of
other participants at the hearing.

is less than 2 cents per hundredweight of producer milk on all reports, the payments required pursuant to &sect;1030.71
for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of the uniform price. The report of such handler shall
not be included in the computation of the uniform price. The report of such handler shall not be included in the computation
for succeeding months until he has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations. Subject to the aforementioned
conditions, the market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in the following manner: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Adopt Proposal No. 2 with the following modifications: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Compute the protein price by multiplying the barrel cheddar cheese price, instead of the cheddar cheese price for
40-pound blocks, by 1.32, and eliminate the plus adjustment based on the whey protein concentrate price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Include an adjustment for the somatic cell count of producer milk and for milk used in Classes II, III, and III&hyph;A.
Class I milk would not have a somatic cell adjustment. The adjustment for somatic cells would be on a hundredweight
basis and would be a positive adjustment beginning with a somatic cell count of 500,000, increasing as the somatic
cell count approaches zero. No adjustment would be applied for somatic cell counts greater than 500,000. The somatic
cell adjustment would be computed by subtracting the actual somatic cell count (in thousands) from 500 and multiplying
by .0005 times the barrel cheese price.

so long as the total payment to all producers reflects the monthly minimum pay price under the Order.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing
Model 747 series airplanes, that currently requires that the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program include
inspections which will give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural Significant
Item (SSI). This action would require the inclusion of additional airplanes to the candidate fleet. This proposal
is prompted by a recommendation from the Airworthiness Assurance Task Force, Model 747 Structures Working Group.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure the continued structural integrity of the total Boeing
Model 747 fleet.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 18, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, Amendment 39&hyph;8526 (58 FR 19571, April 15, 1993), applicable
to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, to require that the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program be
revised to include inspections which will give no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural
Significant Item (SSI). That action was prompted by a structural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
re-evaluation by the manufacturer which identified additional structural elements where, if damage should occur,
supplemental inspections may be required for timely detection. The requirements of that AD are intended to ensure
the continued structural integrity of the total Boeing Model 747 fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Document No. D6&hyph;35022, Volumes 1 and 2,
``Supplemental Structural Inspection Document (SSID) for Model 747 Airplanes,'' Revision E, dated June 17, 1993,
that revises the effectivity by adding airplanes to the candidate fleet on which supplemental inspections that give
no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR) for each Structural Significant Item (SSI) must be performed.
This document also clarifies the selection criteria for candidate airplanes. The original Model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
747&hyph;100 and &hyph;200 series airplanes in the candidate fleet were selected based on having accumulated 10,000
flight cycles by June 30, 1983. Subsequently, selected high time airplanes were added to the candidate fleet to replace
out-of-service airplanes. Incorporation of the inspections described in this document will ensure the continuing
structural integrity of the total Boeing Model 747 fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the failure of an SSI can compromise the structural integrity of these airplanes, and since such conditions
are likely to exist or develop on other Model 747 series airplanes, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01
to expand the applicability to require that the inspections identified in the Boeing document, described previously,
be performed on the airplanes in the candidate fleet to provide no less than the required damage tolerance rating (DTR)
for each Structural Significant Item (SSI) listed in Revision E of the SSID. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the FAA has identified eight additional airplanes that are not listed in Revision E of the Boeing Document,
and that must be added to the candidate fleet to replace certain airplanes that were removed from the candidate fleet.
Some of these newly identified airplanes were operated as short range (SR) airplanes and have now been converted to
freighters. Therefore, the FAA has determined that these airplanes must be included in the SSID program, and that
supplemental inspections must also be performed on these additional airplanes to ensure safety of the entire Boeing
Model 747 fleet. The AD proposes to expand the applicability by adding these eight airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 128 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 87 airplanes of U.S. registry and 8 U.S. operators would be affected by this proposed AD. Incorporation
of the SSID program into an operator's maintenance program, as required by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, and retained in
this proposal, is estimated to necessitate 1,000 work hours (per operator) at an average labor rate of $55 per work
hour. Based on these figures, the total cost to the 8 affected U.S. operators to incorporate the SSID program is estimated
to be $440,000, or $55,000 per U.S. operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recurring inspections costs, as required by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, and retained in this proposal, is estimated
to be 1,275 work hours per airplane at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the annual recurring
cost required by AD 93&hyph;06&hyph;01, and retained in this proposal, is estimated to be $6,100,875 for the affected
U.S. fleet, or $70,125 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since no new operators have been added by this proposal, there will be no new costs associated with incorporating the
SSID program into an operator's maintenance program. Therefore, the future economic cost impact of this proposal
on U.S. operators is now only the cost of the recurring inspections for these additional airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of required work hours for the recurring inspections in this proposal, as indicated above, is presented
as if the accomplishment of the actions were to be conducted as ``stand alone'' action. However, in actual practice,
these actions, for the most part, would be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally scheduled
airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the actual number of necessary additional
work hours will be minimal in many instances. Additionally, any costs associated with special airplane scheduling
will be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document revises an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain de Havilland Model
DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes, that would have required a one-time inspection to assess the adequacy of the clearance
between various adapter plates and seal retaining angles on the fuselage side access panel, and modification, if
necessary. That proposal was prompted by reports of incidents involving corrosion and fatigue cracking in commuter-class
airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. This action revises the proposed rule
by requiring modification of both the forward and rear seal retention angles, regardless of whether damage is found.
The actions specified by this proposed AD are intended to prevent degradation of the structural capabilities of the
affected airplanes.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to add an airworthiness directive (AD), applicable
to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;7 series airplanes, was published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM)
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 4, 1993 (58 FR 12349). That NPRM would have required a one-time inspection to assess the adequacy of the clearance
between: (1) The wing forward pick-up adapter plate and the seal retaining angle on the fuselage side access panel,
and (2) the wing rear mounting adapter plates and the seal retaining angle on the fuselage side access panel; and modification,
if necessary. That NPRM was prompted by reports of incidents involving corrosion and fatigue cracking in commuter-class
airplanes that are approaching or have exceeded their economic design goal. That condition, if not corrected, could
result in degradation of the structural capabilities of the affected airplanes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has received a comment that has caused the FAA to reconsider its position on
certain aspects of the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter requests that the proposal be revised to require modification of the forward and rear retention angles
and adapter plates, regardless of whether damage is found in the adapter plates. The commenter contends that if the
forward and rear seal retainers are not trimmed, they may be inadvertently interchanged with seal retainers from
other airplanes in an operator's fleet. The FAA concurs. The FAA has reviewed all available data and has determined
that in order to preclude the possibility for installing an untrimmed seal retainer in an airplane that lacks sufficient
clearance, the forward and rear seal retainers must be trimmed. Although the referenced service bulletins do not
specify trimming the forward and rear seal retainers when the seal retainers are found undamaged, the FAA finds that
safety can be best assured when the seal retainers are trimmed, regardless of whether damage is found, to avoid the
possibility for inadvertently interchanging seal retainers from other airplanes. Therefore, proposed paragraph
(a) of the previously issued NPRM has been revised to propose requiring that Modification 7/2319 (forward adapter
plates and seal retaining angle), and paragraph (b) of the NPRM has been revised to propose requiring that Modification
7/2355 (rear adapter plates and seal retaining angle) be accomplished.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, this commenter indicates that the proposed 6-month compliance time to accomplish the inspection was unnecessarily
stringent in light of the age of the service bulletins. From this comment, the FAA infers that the commenter requests
an extension to the compliance time, although the commenter does not specify an alternative. The FAA concurs that
the compliance time may be extended somewhat. The FAA has determined that extending the compliance time by 6 additional
months will not adversely affect safety, and will allow the inspection to be performed at a base during regularly scheduled
maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be available. It will also provide additional
time to accomplish the additional modification proposed in this action. Therefore, paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
supplemental NPRM have been revised to require that the inspection be accomplished within 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since certain of these changes expand the scope of the originally proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is necessary
to reopen the comment period to provide additional opportunity for public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 44 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
8 work hours per airplane to accomplish the modifications and inspections, and that the average labor rate is $55 per
work hour. Required parts would be nominal in cost. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD
on U.S. operators is estimated to be $19,360, or $440 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator
has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

I. Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission estimates the public reporting burden for this collection of information under the proposed rule
to average 66.2 hours per respondent, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The information
will be collected under FERC&hyph;592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines. In lieu of being physically
filed with the Commission on a periodic basis as a ``response'' or ``filing'', the data will be updated continuously
and made available to customers/shippers, the public, and the Commission by Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBs) established
and maintained by the pipeline respondents pursuant to Order No. 636. The annual reporting burden for some 61 respondents
under the proposed rule is estimated to total 4,038.2 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the proposed rule provides for fewer information items, the burden estimate for FERC&hyph;592 in the subject
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) represents a burden reduction of 63 hours per respondent_or a total reduction
of 3,843 hours. The current annual reporting burden attributable to the FERC&hyph;592 information collection is
7,882 hours. A copy of this proposed rule is being provided to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may send comments regarding the burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information,
including suggestions for further reductions of this burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North
Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415,
FAX (202) 208&hyph;2425]. Comments on the requirements of this proposed rule may also be sent to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Washington, DC 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(202) 395&hyph;6880].

II. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission, in Order No. 497,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 issued a rule intended to prevent pipelines from providing preferential treatment to their marketing or brokering
affiliates. The rule adopted standards of conduct (codified at part 161 of the Commission's regulations)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and tariff and reporting requirements (codified in &sect;250.16).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The reporting requirements required the pipelines to file FERC Form No. 592, a log containing information relating
to transportation for affiliated marketers, and to maintain the same information for nonaffiliated shippers. The
Commission imposed a sunset provision requiring a reevaluation of the requirements of the rule within one year to
determine whether increased competition in transportation had mitigated the concerns about affiliate abuse. The
Commission has extended the sunset provision until December 31, 1993, and, contemporaneously with this NOPR, is
issuing Order No. 497&hyph;E which extends the reporting requirements until June 30, 1994.

In Order No. 636, the Commission created a new operating environment for interstate pipelines and shippers by requiring
pipelines to unbundle their sale of gas from their transportation service and implementing changes in the terms and
conditions for providing transportation. One of the principal changes introduced by Order No. 636 was the initiation
of capacity release mechanisms through which firm shippers can release their firm transportation capacity, including
storage capacity, to others wanting to obtain the capacity. The Commission mandated that all allocations of firm
capacity, both firm capacity available from the pipeline and released capacity, be implemented through Electronic
Bulletin Boards (EBBs) operated by the pipelines (or operated on their behalf by third parties). The Commission also
has begun the process, in Docket No. RM93&hyph;4&hyph;000, of standardizing the methods by which pipelines will
provide information about available capacity through their EBBs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another significant change in Order No. 636 was the Commission's determination that pipelines must provide shippers
with flexible receipt and delivery points. The Commission provided this flexibility to promote efficient use of
pipeline capacity particularly through the capacity releasing mechanism. A shipper obtaining released capacity
(replacement shipper) is not restricted to using the receipt or delivery points of the releasing shipper; it is able
to select alternate receipt or delivery points for that capacity to accord with its requirements for transportation
service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission previously has addressed the effect of EBBs and capacity release on the Order No. 497 requirements.
In Order No. 497&hyph;D, the Commission eliminated the requirement that pipelines file the Form No. 592 containing
the affiliated transportation log with the Commission, requiring instead that they provide this information on
their EBBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission also determined that Order No. 497 does not apply to temporary capacity releases, because such releases
are not a request for transportation to the pipeline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The releasing shipper, not the pipeline, controls and makes the determination to release capacity; the pipeline
merely facilitates the transaction.

Northwest Pipeline Corporation, 65 FERC &para;61,007 (1993). A temporary capacity release occurs when the releasing
shipper retains its rights to the capacity when the release period ends. A permanent release ends the releasing shipper's
rights and responsibilities under the contract and the contract is transferred to the replacement shipper.

Now that Order No. 636 has been implemented on virtually all pipelines, the Commission finds this to be the opportune
time to do a comprehensive reevaluation of the Order No. 497 requirements in light of the requirements of Order No.
636 as well as the Commission's experience under Order No. 497. In Order No. 636, the Commission stated that increased
competition resulting from the unbundling of gas sales from transportation service might reduce the pipelines'
incentive for granting preferences to affiliates, but it concluded such competition probably would not eliminate
the incentive altogether.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Similarly, the implementation of capacity release may reduce the pipelines' incentive to provide its marketing
affiliates with preferences for interruptible transportation, because shippers seeking interruptible service
are not restricted to the pipeline as the sole avenue for such service, as they were in the past; they now can obtain firm
service through capacity release which is superior to the pipelines' interruptible service.

At this juncture, the Commission does not deem the evidence sufficient to warrant rescission of the Order No. 497 standards
of conduct and tariff and reporting requirements. As part of its continuing assessment of the need for these regulations,
the Commission will consider in the final rule any comments relating to the need for, and retention of, these regulations
as a whole. Nevertheless, the significant changes wrought by Order No. 636 do appear to warrant substantial revision
of the Order No. 497 standards of conduct and tariff and reporting requirements to eliminate unnecessary information
and to reduce and streamline the compliance burden. Modifications to the Order No. 497 filing requirements also are
needed to conform the regulations with the requirement that affiliate information be posted on pipeline EBBs.

or tieing an agreement to release gas subject to take-or-pay relief to the purchase of services from a marketing affiliate.
The Commission in Order No. 636 established procedures for dealing with gas supply realignment costs resulting from
the reformation or termination of take-or-pay contracts after the unbundling of sales from transportation service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Revisions To Coordinate With Other Regulatory Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reporting requirements currently apply to interstate pipelines transporting gas pursuant to subparts B, G,
H, or K of part 284. The Commission proposes to remove the references to subparts H and K. Subpart H applies to capacity
release transactions and is an unnecessary and duplicative reference, since, by its own terms, it applies only to
pipelines transporting gas under subparts B and G. Subpart K, which applies to pipelines transporting gas on the outer
continental shelf, is similarly unnecessary because, it too, requires such pipelines to transport gas pursuant
to subpart G. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Tariff Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Current &sect;250.16(b)(1) presently requires pipelines to include in their tariffs information about shared
operating personnel and facilities, the information and format for a request for service, the procedures used to
address complaints, and the procedures used to inform shippers about the availability and pricing of transportation
service. Current &sect;250.16(g)(1) requires pipelines to maintain and follow certain procedures to make the tariff
information available to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission proposes to eliminate the requirement, in current &sect;250.16(b)(1)(ii), that pipelines include
in their tariffs the information required for a valid request for service, including the information required for
the Form No. 592 affiliate transportation log. This provision was intended to ensure that pipelines obtained from
a shipper requesting service information known to the shipper, but not to the pipeline, which the pipeline was required
to maintain by the regulations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
12
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The information which pipelines needed to obtain included items such as the supplier of gas, the end-user, and whether
or not the gas was subject to take-or-pay relief. The requirement for pipelines to include the request for service
information in their tariff no longer appears necessary, because pipeline tariffs already include procedures for
requesting service, and more important, this NOPR is proposing to eliminate the information which the pipelines
previously had to obtain from the transportation request form. Under the proposed regulations, pipelines should
know all the relevant information, without having to obtain additional information from the requesting shipper.

The Commission proposes to eliminate the requirement, in current &sect;250.16(b)(1)(iv), that requires pipeline
tariffs to include the procedures used to inform affiliated and nonaffiliated shippers of the availability and pricing
of transportation service and of the capacity available for transportation. This requirement appears superfluous
since pipelines are required under Order No. 636 to provide equal and timely access on their EBBs to information relevant
to the availability of service on their systems.

Current &sect;250.16(b)(2) requires pipelines to file with the Commission a transportation log reporting a variety

information for nonaffiliate transactions. The Commission is proposing to reduce the amount of information that
must be maintained and to clarify the filing requirements in light of the requirement, promulgated in Order No. 497&hyph;D,
that pipelines post the information on their EBBs in lieu of filing it with the Commission.

The Commission is proposing to eliminate the requirement that pipelines maintain information relating to firm transportation
under &sect;250.16. As a result of Order No. 636, the posting and awarding of firm service, including the reservation

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

The Commission recognizes that pipelines may offer firm shippers discounts on the reservation charge after the capacity
is awarded and also may discount the firm usage charge. But the Commission does not deem the potential for such discounting
sufficient to warrant the continuation of the reporting requirements under &sect;250.16. Such discounting has
not proven to have been extensive in the past. Moreover, information on any firm discounts that pipelines do provide
affiliates will be available on pipeline EBBs under former standard I and under the Commission's Part 284 discount
reporting requirements, although without as much detail as required by &sect;250.16. See 18 CFR 161.3(i)(revised
&sect;161.3(h)); 18 CFR .8(b)(4)(v) (requiring standards of conduct information to be posted on EBBs); 18 CFR 284.7(d)(5)(4).
In addition, the Commission's adoption of straight-fixed-variable (SFV) rate design in Order No. 636 virtually
eliminates the pipelines' ability to discount the firm usage rate as well as the impact of any discounts if they did
occur. Under SFV, the usage rate reflects only variable costs (and applicable volumetric surcharges), and pipelines
cannot discount below variable cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For interruptible transportation, however, the EBBs will not provide the relevant discount information, because,
unlike firm service, the EBBs will not be used to allocate interruptible capacity or establish a shipper's rate for
interruptible service.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 The allocation of interruptible transportation and the rate for individual transactions usually takes place during
the pipelines' monthly and daily nomination and scheduling process. Accordingly, the Commission is retaining the
current requirement to maintain and post information for discounts on interruptible service (proposed &sect;250.16(c)).

 The Commission's experience in administering Order No. 497 is that the most important information for monitoring
potential undue discrimination is the discount information for individual transactions. Once that information
is known, the Commission can obtain information regarding the transportation request during an investigation if
it is needed. Indeed, some of the information on the request, such as the extent of affiliation between pipelines and
suppliers or shippers, would appear to be well known to the parties transacting business on the pipelines and should
not need to be posted.

The Commission is proposing to eliminate a series of requirements for posting information obtained from the transportation
request on the source and destination of gas.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
21
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Information from the transportation request form on source and destination should no longer be of much value since
the Commission has required pipelines to provide for flexible receipt and delivery points. By making use of alternate
receipt or delivery points, shippers will be able to transport gas between a variety of sources and destinations,
regardless of the source or destination information provided on the transportation request form. The Commission,
however, is retaining the requirement that pipelines post the quantity of gas at each delivery point for discounts
actually granted.

The Commission has not proposed to delete certain information relating to requests for service, such as the position

In Order No. 636&hyph;A, the Commission addressed the requirement in current &sect;250.16(b)(2)(xiv) for reporting

 A commenter had requested additional protection against affiliate abuse, contending that, after unbundling, a
pipeline could avoid the Order No. 497 requirement to post transportation discounts by charging its affiliate the
maximum transportation rate to deliver the gas, but selling gas to its affiliate at a loss. As part of its response,
the Commission stated that concealment of such an arrangement would be difficult in light of the &sect;250.16(b)(2)(xiv)
requirement for pipelines to report whether affiliated marketers or their blanket sales operating units were selling
gas below cost.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, after further consideration and review of experience under Order No. 497, the Commission is proposing to
eliminate the sales below cost provision, because it has not proved meaningful in evaluating discounts granted by
pipelines. The Commission understands the pipelines obtain the information on below cost sales from the affiliated
marketer in its initial request for service. The information reported by the pipeline, therefore, would not provide
current below cost sales information that can be directly related to the current transportation arrangements posted
in the log. Experience also shows that 98% of the time pipelines report this information as ``no'' or ``unknown''.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has no evidence that the manipulation of gas and transportation prices, as suggested by the comment
in Order No. 636&hyph;A, has occurred or resulted in discrimination. Moreover, the Commission seriously doubts
whether, in the competitive market for gas sales, any pipeline reporting requirement would permit monitoring of
the ever-changing price which shippers, whether affiliated marketers or others, will be paying for gas. Shippers
in the market are in a better position to obtain information on gas prices and to file complaints with the Commission
if they believe a manipulation of gas and transportation prices results in an undue discrimination relating to the
transportation component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also is proposing to clarify the reporting requirements by requiring the provision of information
on whether an affiliate or sales operating unit is involved in the transportation transaction and its role. Current
&sect;250.16(b)(2) (revised &sect;250.16(d)) already requires pipelines to report transactions in which an affiliated
marketer is involved, even if it is not the shipper. For example, an affiliate or pipeline sales operating unit could
be involved in a transaction as a seller of gas or as an agent, but not as the shipper. The requirement to report the extent
of such involvement would ensure that those obtaining the affiliate information would know the role of the pipeline
affiliate when it is not a shipper.

The existing regulations require pipelines to file transportation logs at the Commission. The Commission is proposing
to conform these filing requirements to the requirement, established in Order Nos. 497&hyph;D and 497&hyph;E, that
pipelines post affiliate information on their EBBs rather than submitting it to the Commission.

To conform the Order No. 497 regulations with the requirements for EBBs, the new regulations would require pipelines
to post affiliate information on their EBBs in conformity with the requirements of &sect;284.8(b)(4) and their tariffs

Current &sect;250.16(d)(4)(ii) provides that filing the discounted rate report for affiliate transactions within
15 days of the close of the billing period satisfies a pipeline's obligation to file discount reports under &sect;284.7(d)(5)(iv).
Since pipelines are no longer required routinely to file transportation logs with the Commission, they must now fully
comply with &sect;284.7(d)(5)(iv) for affiliate transactions.

IV. Sunset Date
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is not proposing to include a sunset provision in this rule. The proposed revisions reduce the compliance
burden significantly, and a firm sunset date, such as one year from issuance, would not necessarily provide sufficient
time for the Commission fully to evaluate the effect of Order No. 636 on the pipelines' incentive to favor affiliates.
The Commission always can reevaluate the rule when sufficient information is available. For example, after evaluation
of the impact of the capacity release mechanism, the Commission may find that the availability of released capacity
has so reduced the significance of interruptible discounts from the pipeline that the regulations are no longer needed.
But, the Commission cannot predict when it would have sufficient data to make such a determination. The Commission
notes that even without a sunset provision, it must review these regulations within three years because the Paperwork
Reduction Act does not permit OMB to approve an information collection requirement for a period in excess of three
years.

(D) All rates should be stated in cents per MMbtu fixed decimal numbers, format f(10,2). For example, $1.5264/MMbtu
should be stated as 152.64. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Negative values should be reported with a ``^'' sign preceding the first nonzero digit reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) Commas must not be included in any numeric field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The sequence number should be right justified, zero filled.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The reference number is the alphanumeric string formed by concatenation of the Schedule ID, Record ID, sequence
number, and item location number. E.g., a respondent's Company ID reported in the first record on the ``General Information''
record would have reference number ``X101000001011'' formed by joining (concatenating) the schedule ID ``X1'',
the record ID ``01'', the sequence number ``000001'', and the item location number ``011''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Report any footnote relative to any item reported on Schedule X1 in the ``Footnotes Record'', (Record 06 of Schedule
X1). Each footnote should be cross referenced to the schedule and record (line) it pertains to by the appropriate reference
number. E.g., a footnote for Company ID reported in the first record of the ``General Information'' record, (Schedule
X1, Record 01), would be recorded in the ``Footnote Record,'' (Schedule X1, Record 06), using the reference number
``X101000001011''. At a minimum, the respondent should report the following information, in footnotes, for each
contract/ request reported in the ``Transportation Service Data Record,'' (Schedule X1, Record 02). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The field ``Respondent Affiliation,'' item number 15, should be footnoted to provide a complete list of personnel
and facilities shared by the interstate pipeline and affiliated marketer or broker, or by the interstate pipeline
and its blanket sales operating unit. Negative reports are required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The field ``Disposition of Request,'' item number 11, should be footnoted to provide any complaints and the disposition
of such complaints by the shipper or end user concerning the requested or furnished service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM published a proposed rule on November 8, 1993 (58 FR 59334), that would revise the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) regulations
in 30 CFR chapter VII, subchapter R to ensure that they will be consistent with agency practice and all past amendments
to Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. The specific changes proposed to the AML rules are set
forth in the November 8, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment period for the proposed rule was scheduled to close on January 7, 1994. However, an extension of the comment
period was requested in order to provide more time in which to comment on the proposed rule. Therefore, OSM is extending
the comment period. Comments will now be accepted until 5 p.m. local time on March 8, 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 USEPA is proposing to disapprove the State of Wisconsin's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) Rules,
Natural Resources (NR) 405.01 through 405.17, as a revision to the Wisconsin State Implementation Plan (SIP). The
State developed the rules as Wisconsin's plan to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in areas designated
as unclassifiable or attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and to satisfy the requirements
of part C of the Clean Air Act (Act). USEPA proposes to disapprove these rules because they do not meet USEPA's regulation
governing State PSD programs (40 CFR 51.166). Until USEPA approves a SIP submission from Wisconsin satisfying these
requirements, the Federal PSD requirements at 40 CFR 52.21 remain applicable within the State of Wisconsin.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1977 Amendments to the Clean Air Act added part C to title I, which required implementation of a PSD program. On June
19, 1978 USEPA promulgated a PSD program to meet the requirements of part C. It promulgated 40 CFR 51.24 (now 40 CFR 51.166),
which listed the requirements a State must meet in order to have a State PSD program approved as a part of its SIP. It promulgated
40 CFR 52.21, which contains the procedures and requirements which USEPA follows when it carries out the mandates
of part C itself. These &sect;52.21 requirements were then promulgated into those State SIPs where a State did not
have an approvable plan in place. Section 52.21 provides that its requirements and authorities, or parts thereof,
can be delegated to the State and local air programs if USEPA determines they have the ability and authority to carry
out its mandates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 On June 19, 1978 (43 FR 26410), USEPA promulgated the Federal PSD program, 40 CFR 52.21(b) through (v), into the Wisconsin
SIP at 40 CFR 52.2581 because Wisconsin had not submitted an approvable PSD program. On August 19, 1980 USEPA gave Wisconsin
partial delegation to run the Federal PSD Program and on November 13, 1987 gave Wisconsin full delegation of the program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seeking a SIP approval of the State's PSD Program, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) submitted
its PSD rules, NR 405.01 through NR 405.17, to USEPA as a revision to its SIP on March 16, 1987. A further revision to these
rules, which addresses oxides of nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), was submitted on November 24, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wisconsin NR 405 deals exclusively with PSD permitting requirements.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 USEPA evaluated NR 405 by comparing each section of the rule to the appropriate paragraph of 40 CFR 51.166 (formerly
40 CFR 51.24). Although Wisconsin's PSD rules essentially incorporated the Federal PSD provisions in 40 CFR 51.166,
USEPA's evaluation revealed deficiencies relative to references to New Source Performance Standards (NSPS), National
Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), federally issued PSD permits, source-specific allowable
emissions, and modeling guidelines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Chapter NR 405 applies the PSD regulation within the total area of the State of Wisconsin. Court decisions have determined
that State governments do not have jurisdiction over most Indian lands. This in itself does not affect USEPA's proposal
to disapprove the rule, but would have to be addressed by Wisconsin if it submitted a revised rule.

II. USEPA's Evaluation of the Proposed Revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. NSPS and NESHAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal PSD definitions at 40 CFR 51.166 pertaining to: (1) ``Best Available Control Technology'' (BACT), (2)
``Allowable emissions'', (3) ``Federally enforceable'', and (4) the control technology review requirements make
reference to applicable standards and standards of performance under 40 CFR part 60 (NSPS) and 40 CFR part 61 (NESHAP),
respectively. In the comparable provisions of the State rule, the State refers to other NR 400 series chapters, i.e.,
NR 440, 445 to 499, and 400 to 499 of the State code. Although the State may have intended that these chapters approximate
the requirements of 40 CFR parts 60 and 61, Wisconsin's NSPS and NESHAP regulations are not federally enforceable
and may, in certain circumstances, differ significantly from the parts 60 and 61 requirements in the Federal PSD requirements.
The references to parts 60 and 61 in the Federal PSD requirements for BACT and control technology review (&sect;&sect;51.166(b)(12)
and 51.166(j)(1), respectively) set minimum emissions requirements. Because the State can set less stringent NSPS
and NESHAP emission limits than the Federal standards, or not set any limits at all, the State PSD provisions which
are dependent upon the requirements of Chapter 440 and Chapters 445 to 449 are not approvable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Stack Height 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provisions in 40 CFR part 51, subpart I_``Revision of New Sources and Modifications'' set forth both general and
specific requirements for permitting PSD sources, including definitions. In order for the State to implement the
stack height provision in accordance with 40 CFR 51.164 and 51.166(h), it must have definitions of such terms as ``stack'',
``dispersion technique'', and ``good engineering practice''. On November 6, 1985, the State submitted a letter
stating that permits issued for new or modified sources will conform with the requirements with the Stack Height Regulation,
as set forth in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 8, 1985, until such time that the State promulgates its own rule. As submitted, this provision meets the stack
height requirements of the PSD program, and USEPA approved Wisconsin's commitment on August 4, 1989 (54 FR 32074),
as a portion of Wisconsin's stack height plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Federally Issued PSD Permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the State's definition of ``major modifications'', NR 405.02(21)(b)(6), the rule exempts an increase in hours
of operation or in production rates from review unless such increases are prohibited by permits issued after January
6, 1975, under NR 405. This rule is deficient for not requiring review of sources with such increases if the increases
were prohibited by previously issued Federal permits or during the period when EPA issued the permits prior to the
delegation of the program's authority. The State rule only exempts from the exclusion those permits with conditions
``pursuant to this chapter'', which is in the Wisconsin rule. There is no requirement for review of modifications
to federally issued permits with exemptions pursuant to 40 CFR 52.21. As submitted, this provision is not approvable
as a PSD rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Source-Specific Allowable Emissions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NR 405.02(1) contains the term ``source-specific allowable emissions''. The meaning of the term is unclear. The
Federal rule depends upon the preamble language published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 7, 1980 (Vol. 45, No. 154), to qualify the term to exclude cases where data on actual emissions are available.
The language in NR 405.02(1) would have to be clarified so that the State term has the same meaning as the Federal term.
This provision is not approvable in its present form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. PSD Increments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State PSD increments for sulfur dioxide and particulate matter are found in Chapter NR 404.05. The increments
were not included in Wisconsin's March 16, 1987 PSD SIP submittal, but were included in its November 24, 1992 submittal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Modeling Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The modeling guidelines referenced in NR 405.10 are now outmoded, although they were current at the time of submittal.
To make NR 405.10 approvable, it would either have to reference the most recent guidelines (See 40 CFR 165(l)) or state
that the applicant must use USEPA's most current applicable guideline models. Although the modeling guidelines
were current at the time of submittal, this deficiency would need to be addressed if Wisconsin were to resubmit the
rule as a SIP revision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 increments. Wisconsin submitted such increments to USEPA on November 24, 1992. This submittal meets the NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 increment requirements and is approvable.

H. Particulate Matter (PM) Significant Level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24713), USEPA promulgated the significant level for PM at 15 tons per year. Wisconsin submitted
two PM SIP revisions on March 13, 1989 and May 10, 1990 to meet the Federal PM requirements. These submittals were proposed
for approval on March 13, 1989 (NR 400.02, 404.02, 405.02, 406.04, 484.03) which contain the PM significant level,
and May 10, 1990 (NR 404.04, 484.03). USEPA then proposed to disapprove the package on December 23, 1992. After receiving
comments from the State, USEPA moved to approve the package. The final rulemaking approving these rules was published
on June 28, 1993 (58 FR 34528). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the deficiencies noted above, USEPA is proposing to disapprove Wisconsin's Prevention of Significant
Deterioration Permit Program as not meeting the requirements of part C of the Clean Air Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency reviewed this PSD SIP revision request for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments enacted
on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action did not conform with the statute before it was amended,
that the Amendments did not in any way affect this determination, and that the revision does not conform to the Act,
as amended. If resubmitted, Wisconsin's PSD SIP submission should include all requirements and changes added by
the 1990 Amendments. Thus, USEPA is proposing that the revision be disapproved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C., section 605(b), I certify that this action will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities (see 46 FR 8709). If USEPA were to disapprove this rule, its disapproval
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because USEPA's PSD program
remains in effect under delegated authority. Sources would remain subject to the same requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Executive Order 12291, this action is not ``Major''. It has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) for review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By the Chief Engineer:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. On December 23, 1993, the Cable-Consumer Electronics Compatibility Advisory Group (Advisory Group) requested
that the time for filing comments to the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) in the above-captioned proceeding be
extended from January 10, 1994 to January 25, 1994 and that the reply comment date be extended from January 25, 1994
to February 9, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In its request, the Advisory Group indicates that a 15 day extension of the comment periods would increase the chances
that the cable and consumer electronics industries, though the Advisory Group, will be able to prepare a joint filing
that help to narrow the issues in dispute between those industries and should increase the quality of such joint submission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Commission does not routinely grant extensions of time.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In this instance, however, we believe that extending the comment deadline by 15 days will serve the public interest
by providing the cable and consumer electronics industries additional opportunity to reach a consensus on the proposals
set forth in the NPRM and should result in a improved record being submitted to the Commission. We also believe it is
in the public interest to extend the reply comment deadline correspondingly. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
it is ordered 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That the deadline for filing comments is extended to January 25, 1994, and the deadline for filing reply comments is
extended to February 9, 1994.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Authorization Act of 1991 directs this agency to initiate rulemaking
to consider the need for any additional brake performance standards for passenger cars, including antilock brake
standards. Pursuant to this mandate, the agency is issuing this notice to obtain responses to questions regarding
the braking performance of passenger cars and other light vehicles and the need to require antilock brake systems
on these vehicles. This notice poses questions about the desirability of a requirement that light vehicles be equipped
with antilock brake systems (ABS), including questions about such a requirement's anticipated safety benefits,
potential regulatory approaches and anticipated performance requirements and test procedures, the requirement's
applicability, its schedule for implementation, and the anticipated costs.

Hydraulic Brake Systems, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
specifies requirements for vehicles equipped with hydraulic brake systems. (49 CFR 571.105). Standard No. 105 applies
to all vehicles except motorcycles that are equipped with hydraulic brakes. It has specific requirements which apply
to passenger cars and to vehicles other than passenger cars with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) (1) equal to or
less than 10,000 pounds and (2) greater than 10,000 pounds.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The Standard's purpose is to ensure safe braking performance under normal and emergency conditions. The Standard
includes a variety of performance requirements that evaluate a vehicle's service brake system in terms of stopping
distance, partial failure, fade and recovery, water recovery, and spike stops. It also sets forth requirements related
to a vehicle's parking brake performance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
None of NHTSA's safety standards currently mandates the installation of antilock braking systems (ABS) on light
vehicles or specifies performance requirements intended to ensure the proper functioning of an ABS voluntarily
installed on a light vehicle. A light vehicle equipped with an ABS is required to meet the same stopping distance requirements
as a non-ABS-equipped light vehicle. In addition, a light vehicle with a failed ABS must be capable of meeting the stopping
distance requirements for partial failure of the service brake system, as follows: passenger cars are required to
stop within 456 feet and other light vehicles must stop within 517 feet when traveling at 60 mph on a high coefficient
of friction surface. (See section S5.5 of Standard No. 105).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has proposed requirements for functioning and failed ABSs. NHTSA is currently reviewing comments to a supplemental
notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) that proposes to establish a new standard, Standard No. 135, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Passenger Car Brake Systems
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, which would replace Standard No. 105 as it applies to passenger cars. (56 FR 30528, July 3, 1991). The rulemaking to
establish the new standard resulted from NHTSA's efforts to harmonize its safety standards with international standards.
The agency anticipates the next regulatory action related to Standard No. 135 will be issued in early 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the SNPRM, NHTSA proposed requirements for functioning antilock systems, which include straight line stops on
high and low coefficient of friction surfaces, a high coefficient of friction to low coefficient of friction surface
transition test, and a low coefficient of friction to high coefficient of friction surface transition test. A high
coefficient of friction surface, such as dry asphalt, is one that is relatively sticky and thus provides higher levels
of braking force and better lateral stability and control during braking. Conversely, a low coefficient of friction
surface, such as wet or icy pavement, is one that is relatively slippery and thus provides lower levels of braking force
and poorer lateral stability and control during braking. These surfaces are referred to as high mu and low mu surfaces,
respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also proposed requirements for failed antilock systems, which are more stringent than Standard No. 105's
antilock failure requirements. For an antilock functional failure, the agency proposed a stopping distance of 85
meters (279 feet) from 100 kilometers per hour (62 mph).

B. Statutory Mandate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 2500 through 2509 of the ``Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991'' are called the ``National
Highway Traffice Safety Administration Authorization Act of 1991'' (``Authorization Act''). Among other things,
the Authorization Act directs NHTSA to initiate rulemaking on a number of safety matters, including brake performance
standards for passenger cars.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's ANPRM initiates the rulemaking required by section 2507 of the Authorization Act. That section provides
that, not later than December 31, 1993, an advance notice of proposed rulemaking be published, in accordance with
the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, to consider the need for any additional brake performance
standards for passenger cars, including ABS standards. The Act also directs the agency to ``consider any such [antilock
brake system] adopted by a manufacturer'' to facilitate and encourage innovation and early application of economical
and effective antilock brake systems for all such vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2507 requires the rulemaking action to be completed not later than 36 months from issuance of the ANPRM. Under
sections 2507 and 2052(b)(2)(B)(ii), the action will be considered completed when the agency either promulgates
a final rule or decides not to promulgate a rule.

C. Antilock Brake Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary benefit of an ABS is its ability to prevent loss-of-control accidents caused by wheel lockup during braking.
This allows the driver to maintain steering control and lateral stability even in panic braking situations. In addition,
vehicles equipped with an ABS typically have enhanced braking efficiency and as a consequence usually have shorter
stopping distances, particularly on low mu surfaces, compared to the same vehicle without an ABS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ABSs help prevent braking induced loss-of-control situations by automatically controlling the amount of braking
pressure applied to a wheel. Current antilock braking systems include wheel speed sensors that measure wheel speeds
and transmit signals to an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The ECU monitors wheel speeds, and changes in wheel speeds,
based on electrical signals transmitted from sensors located at the wheels or within the axle housings. If the wheels
start to lock, the ECU signals a modulator control valve to actuate, thereby holding constant or reducing the amount
of braking pressure applied to the wheel or axle that is nearing lockup. This continuous feedback cycle of sensing,
controlling, modulating, and sensing prevents wheel lockup, and results in improved vehicle stability and steering
control during braking on all types of road surface conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two primary types of ABS configurations that are currently available for most light vehicles: all-wheel
systems and rear-wheel-only systems. An all-wheel ABS directly controls all the wheels on the vehicle, typically
by using individual wheel control for the front axle wheels and either individual wheel control or select low control
for the rear axle wheels. (Select low control provides the same brake pressure modulation to both wheels of an axle
whenever either wheel on that axle approaches lockup.) A vehicle equipped with an all-wheel ABS is able to maintain
steering control, even during hard braking on wet surfaces. Because maintaining steering control can be a key factor
in accident avoidance, a vehicle equipped with an all-wheel ABS would be expected to experience better lateral stability
and control during hard braking, particularly on wet or slippery road surface conditions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rear-wheel-only ABSs directly control only the rear wheels of the vehicle, using the select low method of control.
A vehicle equipped with a rear-wheel-only ABS may still experience front wheel lockup during braking, since the front
wheels are not controlled by the ABS. Rear-wheel-only systems have relatively less accident reduction potential
than all-wheel systems, because front wheel lockup could result in a vehicle losing steering control. In a crash-threatening
situation, maintaining steering control can be a critical factor in accident avoidance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ABSs are currently available on over 130 models of passenger cars and other light vehicles (light trucks and vans (LTVs),
and sport utility vehicles). ABSs are offered as standard equipment on almost all top-of-the line models and as standard
equipment or an option on an increasing number of mid-priced and low-priced models. For instance, the Chevrolet Cavalier
with a manufacturer's suggested retail price of under $10,000 offers an ABS as standard equipment. Manufacturers
of ABSs currently available on vehicles sold in the United States include Bendix, Bosch, Dewandre-WABCO, GM-Delco,
Honda, Kelsey-Hayes, Nippondenso, Sumitomo, and Teves.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, 2,682,218 of the passenger cars sold in the United States were equipped with an ABS. This represented approximately
32 percent of all passenger cars sold in this country during that year. Passenger cars that are equipped with an ABS
typically have an all-wheel ABS that permits steering control since the system modulates the brake force at each wheel.
That same year, approximately 3,600,000 of the other light vehicles sold in the United States were equipped with an
ABS, and approximately 3,100,000 of those vehicles were equipped with a rear-wheel-only ABS. While rear-wheel-only
systems provide benefits (e.g., improved stability during braking) for light trucks that frequently experience
a wide range of loading levels, a rear-wheel-only ABS provides no ABS control to the front wheels.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These nearly 6,300,000 ABS-equipped passenger cars and light trucks represented 49 percent of the 12.8 million light
vehicles sold in the United States in 1992. Based on reports from industry, NHTSA estimates that over 75 percent of
all new passenger cars and other light vehicles will be equipped with an ABS by 1996.

II. NHTSA Activities Related to Braking Performance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the years, NHTSA has studied the effectiveness of ABSs in avoiding crashes and reducing their severity. The agency
conducted the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Tri-Level Study of the Causes of Traffic Accidents,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (DOT HS 801&hyph;631, Final Report, June 1975) to determine the effectiveness of ABSs. While this is not a recent study,
its conclusions might still be relevant. Among these conclusions are that (1) rear-wheel-only ABSs had an accident
reduction potential of one to four percent, (2) four wheel ABSs provide the greatest safety benefits and could reduce
accidents by eight to 15 percent, (3) an ABS's ability to maintain control was found to be a more important safety attribute
than its ability to improve stopping distance performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has also conducted test track evaluations of ABS equipped light vehicles. (Hiltner, Arehart, and Radlinski,
``Light Vehicle ABS Performance Evaluation,'' DOT HS 807 813, December 1991; and ``Light Vehicle ABS Performance
Evaluation_Phase II,'' DOT HS 807 924, May 1992.) The December 1991 report describes tests conducted on ten light
vehicles to evaluate the improvement in braking performance and vehicle stability and control resulting from each
vehicle's ABS. The test program's purpose was to show the degree to which an ABS improves a given vehicle's brake performance,
not to compare vehicles or similar ABSs to one another. Therefore, each vehicle was tested with the ABS ``on'' and with
the ABS ``off'' or disabled. Eight of the ten vehicles were equipped with an all-wheel ABS. Each vehicle was run through
a set of eighteen separate test conditions, using both panic stops and driver-best-effort stops in both the empty
and loaded condition at speeds of 35 mph and 60 mph. Braking maneuvers consisted of straight line stops on a uniform
surface, straight line stops on a split mu surface, stops in a 500 foot curve, and stops involving lane changes. The
tests were conducted at 35, 45, 50, and 60 mph, at both the empty and loaded weight conditions. The tests were conducted
on a variety of surfaces, including wet Jennite, gravel, and dry concrete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the findings in the December 1991 report were that (1) each ABS, and especially the all-wheel systems, improved
the vehicle's lateral stability during panic braking; (2) the all-wheel systems shortened stopping distances on
most hard paved surfaces, with improvements of up to 25 percent on wet concrete and up to 50 percent on wet Jennite; (3)
each ABS lengthened the vehicle's stopping distances in panic stops on gravel, with increases exceeding 25 percent
in some cases; and (4) the rear-wheel system enhanced the vehicle's lateral stability but did not reduce stopping
distances in most panic brake applications.

The May 1992 report describes tests conducted on eight light vehicles to evaluate how the ABS influenced vehicle stopping
distance and lateral stability and control on various surfaces. This evaluation supplements the December 1991 program
by testing different vehicles on more slippery test surfaces, although it only used straight line maneuvers. Among
the report's findings were that (1) with one exception, the seven vehicles with all-wheel systems were under complete
directional control during the tests with the ABS ``on,'' (2) the vehicle with a rear-wheel-only ABS generally provided
improved, but not complete, lateral stability and control, (3) ABSs improved stopping performance on all surfaces,
except that stopping distance worsened on dry gravel surfaces, and (4) no vehicle experienced problems in the high
to low mu transition testing with the ABS operational.

NHTSA has recently published two proposals related to the braking performance of medium and heavy vehicles (hereinafter
referred to as ``heavy vehicles''). On February 23, 1993, the agency proposed reinstating stopping distance requirements
for these vehicles. (58 FR 11003). In addition, on September 28, 1993, the agency published a proposal that would require
heavy vehicles to be equipped with an ABS to improve the lateral stability and control of these vehicles during braking.
(58 FR 50738). The ABS requirement would be supplemented by a 30 mph braking-in-a-curve ``check'' test conducted
on a low coefficient of friction surface using a full, panic brake application. Some of the issues raised in these rulemakings,
such as the test surface and the proposed definition of ``ABS,'' are relevant to this rulemaking.

This ANPRM discusses whether the agency should propose to require ABS for light vehicles, pursuant to the mandate
in ISTEA. While manufacturers are equipping an increasingly large number of light vehicles with ABS, it appears that
it would be quite a few years, if ever, before all light vehicles would voluntarily be equipped with such devices. Based
on the agency's review of comments to this notice and its review of additional accident data and other information,
NHTSA will determine whether it should propose to require that all light vehicles be equipped with ABSs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This ANPRM also makes a number of requests for data and information. The agency wishes to emphasize that since this
is an ANPRM, no rule will be issued on this specific subject without first issuing an ANPRM to provide further opportunity
to comment. In commenting on a particular matter on responding to a particular question, interested persons are requested

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The threshold issue in deciding whether to amend an existing safety standard concerns the requirement's safety need.
NHTSA is reviewing accident data, including information from the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS), NHTSA's
General Estimates System (GES), the National Accident Sampling System (NASS), and State accident data files. This
review focuses on the benefits achieved by equipping light vehicles with an ABS in a variety of different crash modes.
Among the crash modes being studied are (1) single vehicle run-off-the-road crashes in which skidding or spinning
was the vehicle's pre-crash stability condition, (2) multi-vehicle crashes resulting from a vehicle's loss-of-control
or inability-to-stop-in-time, and (3) crashes in which a vehicle strikes pedestrians, animals, or road objects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial data from these sources indicate that braking induced loss-of-control crashes and inability-to-stop-in-time
crashes are frequent types of crashes that warrant further study. Such crashes are especially prevalent on wet or
slippery roads, a condition in which ABSs would be effective. Eleven percent of all fatal crashes in 1991 occurred
on wet or slippery roads, and 18 percent of property-damage-only crashes occurred under such conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA's research test findings indicate that equipping light vehicles with an ABS would be beneficial to safety.
The primary benefit with equipping light vehicles with an ABS is that a driver is better able to maintain vehicle stability
and steering control during crash-threatening braking situations. A secondary, but still important benefit with
an ABS, is that a vehicle's stopping ability is improved on some surfaces.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA's preliminary evaluation of rear-wheel antilock brake systems indicates that such ABSs on light trucks are
particularly effective in reducing the number of run-off-road crashes. Analyses of State accident files found that
rear-wheel ABS was effective in reducing the risk of such nonfatal rollovers (and side and frontal impacts with fixed
objects) for almost every type of truck, under any type of road condition. Reductions of rollovers were typically
in the 30&hyph;40 percent range, reductions of side impacts with fixed objects in the 15&hyph;30 percent range, and
reductions in frontal impacts with fixed objects in the 5&hyph;20 percent range. The risk of collisions with pedestrians,
animals, bicycles, trains, or on-road objects was also significantly reduced, by about 5&hyph;15 percent. A copy
of this preliminary evaluation is available in the public docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is continuing to analyze the data and a comprehensive report of the findings will be published at a later date.
In the meantime, the agency requests additional information on braking induced loss-of-control crashes and inability-to-stop-in-time
crashes from rental fleets, corporate fleets, insurance companies, police officers, and others. This information
would assist the agency in its efforts to quantify the benefits from ABSs. Accordingly, the agency requests comments
from these organizations and others about their experiences in which drivers of light vehicles have lost control
during braking or been unable to stop before a crash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With these considerations in mind, the agency poses the following questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Based on the available data, what safety benefits would result from the issuance of requirements to prevent or minimize
the effect of braking induced loss-of-control crashes or inability-to-stop-in-time crashes? In what types of crashes
would these benefits occur? Please provide estimates in terms of accidents, injuries, and fatalities prevented.
The agency also requests quantitative estimates of reductions in property damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What additional injury and non-injury data and other information exist about real-world crashes and near crashes
involving drivers of light vehicles who skidded or otherwise lost control?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. At the time of loss-of-control or inability-to-stop-in-time crashes, what were the driving conditions and weather
environment? At what speed was the vehicle traveling? Was the roadway dry, wet, or icy? To what degree did these adverse
driving conditions contribute to the crash and its severity? Did the crash occur on an interstate, secondary highway,
or residential road? What, if any, crash avoidance maneuver precipitated the crash?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. With respect to loss-of-control or inability-to-stop-in-time crashes known to the commenter, would equipping
the vehicle with an ABS or a more effective ABS (e.g., an all-wheel system instead of a rear-wheel-only system) have
helped in avoiding any of the crashes or reducing their severity?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. With respect to fleets that have switched or begun switching to ABS-equipped light vehicles, have the ABS-equipped
light vehicles had a lower crash rate than the non-ABS-equipped light vehicles? If there has been a reduction in crashes,
please quantify the reduction in terms of lives saved, injuries prevented, and property damage reduced.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If NHTSA were to propose amending its braking safety standards to improve the lateral stability and control of light
vehicles during braking, the amendment would have to meet the Vehicle Safety Act's criteria that the requirement
be practicable and be stated in objective terms (section 103(a)). Any rulemaking addressing antilock would also
be guided by the findings in

held that at the time of their implementation, parts of Standard No. 121 were not reasonable nor practicable. The court
held that objective test methods and more probative and convincing data evidencing the reliability and safety of
vehicles that are equipped with antilock and in use must be available before the agency can enforce a standard requiring
its installation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In the NPRM addressing lateral stability and control for heavy vehicles, NHTSA proposed that each heavy vehicle
be equipped with an antilock braking system that satisfies the agency's proposed definition of ``ABS.'' In addition,
as a ``check'' on the performance of the ABS, the agency proposed that a heavy vehicle would have to comply with a braking-in-a-curve
test. The agency tentatively concluded that this approach would ensure that heavy vehicles would be able to significantly
improve their lateral stability and control during braking.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is considering applying this approach to light vehicles by proposing both a requirement mandating the installation
of ABSs on light vehicles and road tests that serve as a check on the performance of the ABS. The agency requests comments
about the possible benefits and shortcomings of using this approach for light vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In developing the proposed definition for ``ABS'' in the heavy vehicle rulemaking, NHTSA referred to the definitions
of ``ABS'' adopted by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) and the Economic Commission for Europe's (ECE) Regulation
13, Annex 13 (1988). Based on these definitions and other considerations, the agency proposed the following definition
of ``antilock brake system'' in the heavy vehicle rulemaking:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
a portion of a service brake system that automatically controls the degree of rotational wheel slip during braking
by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) sensing the rate of angular rotation of the wheels;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) transmitting signals regarding the rate of wheel angular rotation to one or more devices which interpret those
signals and generate responsive controlling output signals; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) transmitting those controlling signals to one or more devices which adjust brake actuating forces in response
to those signals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this definition describing fundamental and necessary performance aspects that any braking system must have
to be considered an ABS, the agency believes that any ABS would be permitted, provided that it is a ``closed loop'' system
that ensures feedback between what is actually happening at the tire-road surface interface and what the device is
doing to respond to impending wheel lockup.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency requests comments about whether to apply to light vehicles the approach proposed to improve the lateral
stability and control of heavy vehicles. Is it necessary and appropriate to supplement the combination of a definition
of ``ABS'' and an equipment requirement with one or more ``check'' tests to ensure the lateral stability and control
of light vehicles? Is the definition of ``ABS,'' as proposed in the heavy vehicle NPRM, appropriate for light vehicles?
What are the advantages or disadvantages of a requirement expressly mandating an ABS instead of taking the more indirect
approach of adopting dynamic tests? Notwithstanding the agency's tentative conclusion that the proposed definition
for heavy vehicle ``ABS'' is sufficiently broad to allow a variety of ABSs, the agency welcomes comment about the use
of this definition for light vehicles. Would it ensure suitable stopping distances and cover all appropriate brake
designs, while not unnecessarily prohibiting brake systems that effectively prevent wheel lockup in a sufficiently
wide variety of circumstances?

8. In the heavy vehicle ABS rulemaking, NHTSA proposed that such vehicles would have to comply with a braking-in-a-curve
test, but decided not to propose additional tests such as a split mu test or a lane change test. The agency believed that
such additional tests would be impracticable for heavy vehicles given the criteria set forth in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
PACCAR. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding the agency's tentative decision in the heavy vehicle ABS rulemaking to propose only a braking-in-a-curve
test, the agency is seeking comment on whether to require that light vehicles be capable of stopping without loss-of-control
in the following test maneuvers:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) While turning on a low mu surface;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) While stopping on a straight line split mu surface;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is considering additional tests for light vehicle antilock systems for three reasons. First, ABS requirements
on passenger cars were originally developed in proposals for Standard No. 135, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Passenger Car Brake Systems, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which are based on the effort to harmonize braking standards with EEC and ECE requirements. These proposals included
split mu tests and surface transition tests. Second, the agency believes that light vehicle ABS may need to have a higher
level of capability for some aspects of performance than heavy vehicle ABS. For instance, the antilock systems on
heavy vehicles do not have to be as quick as the systems on light vehicles in responding to impending wheel lock. The
wheel lockup allowed by light vehicle antilock systems available today is about 0.2 seconds, compared with a lockup
duration closer to one second for heavy vehicle systems. This is so because heavy vehicles typically have a longer
wheel base than light vehicles, and a high vehicle moment of inertia about the vertical axis. On these vehicles, yaw
movement during braking with ABS on a split mu surface or during a braking-in-a-curve maneuver takes place at a relatively
slower rate than on light vehicles, primarily because of the higher vehicle moment of inertia. Third, in contrast
to testing light vehicles, the availability of test facilities and the safety of the tests would make more extensive
testing impracticable for heavy vehicles because such vehicles are larger and more prone to rollover than light vehicles.
For the above reasons, the split mu and surface transition tests might be appropriate additions to the braking-in-a-curve
test for light vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency anticipates that each of these tests would be conducted at 30 mph using a full pedal application (200 pounds
pedal force applied within 0.2 seconds) and that the vehicle would be required to stay within a 12-foot lane. There
would be no stopping distance requirement as part of these tests. (The issue of separate tests for stopping distance
is discussed below in connection with question 13.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. As mentioned above, NHTSA is considering whether to propose a ``braking-in-a-curve test'' in which a light vehicle's
braking would be evaluated at a relatively slow speed on a slippery surface. This test is designed to evaluate the capability
of a vehicle to be controlled while braking in a curve. The test could be conducted on a 500-foot radius curve on a surface
with a peak friction coefficient (PFC) of 0.5 or less. What benefits would be obtained from such a braking-in-a-curve
test? What problems, if any, would be associated with this maneuver? Would this testing approach be a sufficient indicator
of the lateral control and stability expected from an ABS equipped light vehicle? How would rear-wheel-only antilock
systems perform under this test procedure? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. NHTSA is considering whether to propose another type of test, possibly as an alternative to the braking-in-a-curve
test. This test is known as a ``split coefficient of friction test'' (or split mu test) and is designed to evaluate a
vehicle's ability to be controlled when one side of a road is slick and the other side is much stickier. If NHTSA were
to propose such a test, it probably would be conducted on a straight lane surface with the high mu part of the surface
having a PFC equal to or greater than 0.5 and the low mu part of the surface having a PFC of less than or equal to one-half
the PFC of the high mu surface. An alternative way to describe the test surface would be to specify the PFCs for both parts
of the surface (e.g., the high mu part would be 0.9 or greater and the low mu part would be 0.45 or less). The test lane would
be split down the centerline along its length, so that the wheels on one side of the vehicle are on the high friction surface
and the wheels on the other side of the vehicle are on the slick surface. What benefits would be obtained from testing
on such a split mu surface? What problems, if any, would result from such a surface? Would this test be a sufficient indicator
of the lateral stability and control expected from an ABS-equipped vehicle? How would rear-wheel-only antilock
systems perform under this test procedure? What is the best way to specify the test surface? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. NHTSA is also considering whether to propose a ``low to high mu surface transition test.'' This test is designed
to evaluate the capability of an antilock system to modulate brake pressure to achieve a high level of deceleration
after the vehicle makes a transition to the high mu surface. NHTSA anticipates that if it proposes such a test, the high
mu surface would have a PFC equal to or greater than 0.5, and the low mu surface would have a PFC of less than or equal to
one half the PFC of the high mu surface. The agency is considering whether to propose requiring that the vehicle achieve
at least 95 percent of the deceleration of the uniform coefficient deceleration on the high mu surface within one second.
What benefits would be obtained from such a transition test? What problems, if any, would be associated with this test
maneuver? Would this test be a sufficient indicator of the modulation capability expected from an ABS-equipped light
vehicle? Would the suggested way of specifying test surfaces be appropriate? The agency requests comments about
whether to specify the time needed to achieve a specific deceleration and to specify a maximum lockup duration during
the transition. How would rear-wheel only antilock systems perform under this test procedure?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. NHTSA is considering whether to propose a ``high to low mu surface transaction test.'' This test is designed to
evaluate the response for the ABS when the vehicle begins braking on a high mu surface then experiences a change to a
low mu surface. This type of surface is discussed in the previous question. The agency is considering whether to require
that the vehicle's wheels not lock for more than 0.2 seconds, with wheel lock defined as 100 percent slip. What benefits
would be obtained from such a surface transition test? What problems, if any, would be associated with this test maneuver?
Would this test be a sufficient indicator of the modulation control and the response to impending wheel lock expected
from an ABS-equipped light vehicle? How would rear-wheel only antilock systems perform under this test procedure?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The efficiency of an ABS affects a vehicle's stopping distance performance with the ABS cycling. Consistent with
the agency's decision in the heavy vehicle ABS rulemaking not to propose stopping distance requirements with tests
involving low mu surfaces, NHTSA does not anticipate proposing, at this stage of this rulemaking, stopping distance
requirements with the curve, split mu, or transaction tests because of the variability of vehicle stopping distance
performance on low mu surfaces. Do commenters agree with the agency's tentative decision not to propose stopping
distance requirements with tests involving low mu surfaces? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding this tentative decision, NHTSA believes that a measurement of efficiency might provide consumers
with information to compare the relative overall performance of various ABSs. In its evaluations, the agency has
calculated ABS efficiency by dividing vehicle decelerations (g's) by the peak friction coefficient measured with
the vehicle's tire. The agency notes that an ABS efficiency value could provide consumers with a means of comparing
the ABS performance capability since no stopping distance requirements are being considered for the tests mentioned
in this notice to evaluate ABS performance. Each antilock system achieves a certain level of efficiency based on design
factors such as the wheel deceleration rate threshold at which ABS cycling begins, the control algorithm, and the
modulator valves. In general, the higher the ABS efficiency, the shorter the stopping distance should be with the
ABS operational. NHTSA's light vehicle ABS testing has shown that the improvements in braking performance provided
by an ABS varies, in some cases considerably, from system to system and from vehicle to vehicle. Hence, simply setting
a standard that requires all-wheel ABS would not necessarily mean that the performance of these systems would be similar.
The agency therefore request comments on what would be an appropriate method for measuring ABS efficiency, and whether
ABS efficiency would be a meaningful indicator of a system's overall performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The current requirements in Standard No. 105 for vehicles with failed antilock systems including stopping distance
requirements from 60 mph of 456 feet for passenger cars and 517 feet for other light vehicles with a GVWR of not more than
10,000 pounds. This test is designed to ensure that the vehicle has adequate braking if the ABS fails. These distances
may be overly generous for an ABS failure on some vehicles, given that the service brake system is generally still intact.
NHTSA anticipates proposing ABS failure requirements for Standard No. 105 similar to those proposed for Standard
No. 135. In that rulemaking, the agency proposed a stopping distance of 279 feet from a test speed of 62 mph on a surface
with a PFC of 0.9. What problems, if any, would be associated with such a requirement? Should the standard allow an ABS
that experiences a large degradation of stopping performance if the ABS fails? What is the best method for disabling
an ABS for a failed system test? Should performance requirements for integrated ABSs be any different from the requirements
for add-on ABSs, in the failed condition? If so, why? Should the failed ABS stopping distance be one absolute value
for all vehicles, or should it be based on the performance relative to the stopping distance performance when each
vehicle's ABS is in the ``on'' position?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15. As explained in the previous section, NHTSA anticipates specifying the test surfaces used in the test procedures
in terms of peak friction coefficient. While the braking-in-a-curve test would have a PFC of 0.5, the split mu and transition
tests would have the surface specified based on the relative PFC of each of the two portions of the surface. The braking-in-a-curve
test surface represents a wet secondary road in poor condition, and the split mu and transition test surface represent
roads with different coefficients of friction such as those with ice patches. What practicability concerns, if any,
are raised by conducting tests on surfaces with both low and high coefficients of friction?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Two different methods of applying brakes can be used when testing ABSs (and braking systems in general). One method
is a ``full pedal'' application typical of how a driver might apply the brake pedal in reaction to a crash-threatening
situation. This type of brake application can precipitate wheel lock-up and loss-of-control if the vehicle is operating
on a slippery surface. A second method is a modulated ``driver-best-effort'' application in which the driver modulates
the brake in an attempt to maintain stability and lateral control. This method enables stops that are as quick and short
as possible while still maintaining stability and steering control. As with the heavy vehicle ABS rulemaking, the
agency anticipates proposing a full pedal application because it is more representative of a typical driver's response
to a real world crash-threatening situation. In addition, such an application is more objective and repeatable.
In specifying the amount of brake application force in this test procedure, the agency anticipates that a pedal force
of 200 pounds in 0.2 seconds would adequately represent a full pedal application for light vehicles. The agency requests
comments about the best way to specify the brake application provisions.

17. Agency testing indicates that all-wheel antilock systems provide full steering control and lateral stability
during braking. Real-wheel-only antilock systems do not ensure steering control during braking, but provide some
measure of vehicle stability during braking. Should the proposed requirements be drafted so that light vehicles
must be equipped with systems that provide ABS control on all wheels, or should the requirements be drafted to allow
rear-wheel-only systems as well? What are the differences in benefits between rear-wheel-only and all-wheel systems?

18. If NHTSA were to propose its braking standards to improve the lateral stability and control of light vehicles during
braking, all light vehicles would have to be equipped with lateral stability and control devices to achieve the new
performance requirements. As mentioned above, all-wheel ABSs were installed on 2,700,000 passenger cars and on
470,000 other light vehicles in 1992. While another 3.1 million light vehicles were equipped with rear-wheel-only
ABSs, vehicles are increasingly being equipped with all-wheel systems rather than rear-wheel-only systems. How
many vehicles would need to be equipped with ABSs to comply with the requirements discussed in this notice? Would it
be necessary to equip a vehicle with an all-wheel ABS to comply with the requirements discussed in this notice or would
rear-wheel-only systems be adequate?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. The ECE currently uses three categories to classify antilock systems by their performance capabilities. While
the ECE mandates the most sophisticated Category I systems for heavy vehicles, ABS installation remains voluntary
for light vehicles. Nevertheless, if a manufacturer decides to equip a light vehicle with ABS, then it must inform
the government approving body about the Category of ABS being installed on a given light vehicle. After being reviewed
by the government, the manufacturer may market its system to consumers as that category of ABS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is considering whether to propose a classification system like the ECE's in which there would be categories
of increasingly stringent performance criteria instead of a minimum requirement for all antilock systems. The performance
criteria, if proposed, might include the following factors:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Category I_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Braking efficiency of the vehicle equal to or greater than 75 percent on all road surfaces, including split
mu.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Meets braking-in-a-curve or split mu test requirements for stability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Meets low mu to high mu surface transition requirement of achieving 95 percent of the uniform coefficient deceleration
within a specified time period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Meets high mu to low mu surface transition requirements for lockup duration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Wheels on all axles must be directly controlled by ABS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Category II_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Braking efficiency of the vehicle equal to or greater than 75 percent on all road surfaces except split mu.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Meets braking-in-a-curve or split mu test requirements for stability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Meets low mu to high mu surface transition requirements of achieving 95 percent of the uniform coefficient
deceleration within a specified time period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Meets high mu to low mu surface transition requirements for lockup duration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Wheels on each axle must be directly controlled by ABS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Category III_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Braking efficiency of each axle having at least one directly controlled wheel equal to or greater than 75 percent,
on all road surfaces except split mu.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Meets low mu to high mu surface transition requirements of achieving 95 percent of the uniform coefficient
deceleration within a specified time period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Meets high mu to low mu surface transition requirements for lockup duration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency anticipates that most, but not all, of the all-wheel ABSs would satisfy the criteria for Category I systems
and that poorer performing all-wheel ABSs and rear-wheel only ABSs would satisfy the less stringent criteria of either
Category II and Category III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifying categories would permit simpler antilock braking systems to comply with the standard, without lowering
the requirements for the higher capability systems. It would also serve to inform consumers that not all ABSs have
the same performance capabilities. However, the agency notes that there might be significant drawbacks to specifying
categories, since such an approach might result in unnecessary complexity and permit the manufacture and installation
of poorer performing systems that do not provide steering control and other significant safety benefits. The agency
invites comments about whether the standard should specify categories of ABSs.

G. Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA's goal in initiating rulemaking to require light vehicles to be equipped with an ABS is to determine whether
significant improvements in braking performance can be achieved at a reasonable cost to manufacturers and consumers.
There are a number of different approaches that the agency could take in scheduling the implementation of the potential
proposals. One approach would be to apply the requirements to passenger cars first and then to all other light vehicles.
A second approach would be for the agency to apply the ABS standards to all light vehicles at the same time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
20. While the Authorization Act requires NHTSA to initiate rulemaking on brake performance for passenger cars, NHTSA
is contemplating using its general authority under the Vehicle Safety Act to broaden this mandate to include trucks,
vans, sport utility vehicles, and buses under 10,000 pounds GVWR. The agency is considering this approach because
it believes that ABS has more potential benefits for vehicles which have a greater disparity between their unloaded
and fully loaded weights. These latter type vehicles fall into this category. The agency notes that the market appears
to agree with this position as ABS is more prevalent in light trucks than passenger cars. NHTSA seeks comment on its
tentative decision to include these vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 21. At this stage in the rulemaking, NHTSA is inclined to propose an effective date of two years after the final rule,
for passenger cars, and three years after the final rule for light vehicles other than passenger cars (i.e., trucks).
The agency believes that this would give the industry sufficient leadtime to develop the production capacity needed
to supply the market with antilock systems. The agency expects that an increasing number of light trucks will be offered
with all-wheel antilock systems, particularly if the proposed requirements cannot be met with rear-wheel-only
systems. If this is the case, then manufacturers of light trucks with these systems might need more leadtime than manufacturers
of passenger cars to comply with the proposed requirements. Would this implementation schedule be appropriate?
Would it be reasonable to accelerate or delay any portion of it? Should the agency apply requirements for ABSs to some
light vehicles but not others?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
22. NHTSA estimates that this rulemaking's potential cost would be approximately $1.04 billion per year. This cost
consists of ABS costs of $920 million, installation costs of about $80 million, and increased fuel costs of about $40
million due to a small increase in vehicle weight. The average retail price of an ABS system to the consumer would be
about $450. This price is based on a cost study of seven ABS systems entitled ``Evaluation of Costs of Antilock Brake
Systems'' and a markup factor of 1.51. The agency's cost estimate assumes that all-wheel ABS would be required on all
light vehicles. It projects that all-wheel ABS would be voluntarily installed as standard equipment in 85 percent
of model year 1999 passenger cars, the first model year that would be affected if a final rule were issued in 1996 and
a 2-year leadtime for compliance were provided. The remaining 15 percent or about 1.4 million vehicles would be equipped
only as a result of a requirement. The cost estimate also projects that all light trucks would be voluntarily equipped
with ABS by model year 1999/2000, 75 percent of them having all-wheel systems. Thus, 25 percent of new light trucks,
or about 1.5 million vehicles, would be involuntarily equipped with all-wheel ABS if the agency issued a final rule
requiring this. In this case, all-wheel ABS hardware and installation costs would be incrementally higher (about
$200 more), as compared to those for rear-wheel systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 How much would it cost per vehicle to equip all light vehicles with all-wheel ABSs? How much would it cost per vehicle
to equip these vehicles with rear-wheel-only ABSs? What would be the likely costs to a final purchaser for either of
the two types of antilock systems? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 23. Each light vehicle manufacturer is requested to provide, with respect to model year 1994, and for each of the following
types of vehicles, passenger cars, light trucks, and light MPVs: the total number of the vehicles it will produce;
the vehicles it will equip with rear-wheel-only ABSs; and the vehicles it will equip with all-wheel ABSs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 With respect to each of model years 1995&hyph;1999, and for each of the following types of vehicles, passenger cars,
light trucks, and light MPVs, what percentages of vehicles do you expect to voluntarily equip with a rear-wheel-only
ABS? With an all-wheel ABS? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Do you expect to install all-wheel ABSs on all of your passenger cars? If so, when? On all of your light trucks? On all
of your light MPVs? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 24. NHTSA notes that some insurance companies currently offer discounts for antilock equipped passenger cars, light
trucks and light MPVs. Which insurers provide such a discount? How large is the discount offered by each of those insurers?
What is the basis for such discounts?

A. DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures and Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has considered the potential burdens and benefits associated with this advance notice. NHTSA has determined
that this advance notice is a significant rulemaking action under the Department of Transportation's Regulatory
Policies and Procedures and an economically significant notice under Executive Order 12866. The advance notice
would have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more. It concerns a matter in which there is substantial
public interest. Further, there is a potential for significant safety benefits if effective requirements can be
developed to address braking stability and control of light vehicles. The preliminary Assessment of Economic Significance
for this advance notice addresses preliminary estimates of the costs and benefits of potential countermeasures
that the agency is considering in this action. Those estimates are summarized below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that ABS is effective in preventing, and reducing the severity of many inability-to-stop-in-time
and loss-of-control crashes. The previously mentioned 1975 Tri-Level study found ABS to be effective. Also, a preliminary
agency evaluation of more current data found rear-wheel ABS on light trucks to be effective in preventing certain
types of crashes. The agency is continuing to analyze the on-road experience of ABS-equipped vehicles as compared
to those with standard braking systems. At this time, the agency does not have sufficient data to estimate the safety
benefits of requiring mandatory installation of ABS on all light vehicles types. In this advance notice, the agency
is requesting information on ABS effectiveness and the safety benefits that could be expected from a requirement
for mandatory installation of the technology. In assessing the cost-effectiveness of any requirement for mandatory
installation of the technology, benefits accruing to vehicles on which ABS would not have been voluntarily installed
would be estimated and compared to the costs associated with equipping those vehicles with ABS. In the case of light
trucks, depending on the extent and type of ABS voluntarily installed and the type of ABS required, the benefits at
issue might be those that would be realized from all-wheel ABS as compared to rear-wheel systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA estimates that the annual consumer cost of requiring antilock brake systems on light vehicles to be $1,040 million:
$710 million for passenger cars and $330 million for light trucks. This assumes that all-wheel systems would be required.
Estimated ABS hardware cost would be $920 million, installation costs would be $80 million, and increased fuel costs
(due to a small increase in vehicle weight) about $40 million.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service proposed to determine the Alabama sturgeon, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Scaphirhynchus suttkusi
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, to be an endangered species and to designate its critical habitat on June 15, 1993 (58 FR 33148). The Alabama sturgeon,
a small sturgeon with a maximum length of about 30 inches, is endemic to the Mobile River system, Alabama and Mississippi.
Its current range is restricted to the lower Alabama River and the Cahaba River in Alabama. Both of these areas and the
free flowing portion of the lower Tombigbee River are proposed as critical habitat. Factors in the sturgeon's decline
include dams, and possible adverse effects from altered water flows, channel maintenance and gravel dredging. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A public hearing on the proposed rule was announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 13, 1993 (58 FR 47851) and was held on October 4, 1993 near Mobile, Alabama. The capacity of the facility
selected for the public hearing was not sufficient for all the individuals that wished to attend. A second hearing
was then announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 55036). The second public hearing was scheduled for November 15, 1993, in Montgomery, Alabama,
to allow additional oral statements to be presented and to receive comment on a scientific report prepared by experts
on the taxonomy and on the likelihood of existence of the Alabama sturgeon. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The November 15 hearing was canceled in response to a preliminary injunction issued on November 9, 1993, that restrained
the Service and others from: (1) Disseminating the scientific report to the public; and, (2) utilizing or relying
upon the scientific report or any product of the experts' deliberations in connection with the decision-making process
on the proposal to list the Alabama sturgeon and to designate its critical habitat. Because the notice announcing
the November 15 hearing specifically addressed the availability of the scientific report and the Service's intent
to receive comments on it, the Service decided to postpone the hearing until a revised notice could be published to
announce the limitations imposed by, and to thereby avoid inadvertent violations of, the court order.

Therefore, a second public hearing has now been scheduled for January 13, 1994, and will allow additional oral statements
to be presented (of course, written comments will also be accepted and will be given equal consideration). The time
allocated for individual oral statements may be limited if the number of parties present at the hearing, or if the conduct
of the individual commenter, necessitate such a limitation. There is no limit, however, on the length or volume of
written comments or materials presented at the hearing or mailed to the Service office in the

, Civ. No. 93&hyph;AR&hyph;2322&hyph;S, the Service considers itself compelled to enforce the following constraints
on the submission of oral and written comments while the court restrictions remain in effect: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Individuals or organizations cannot refer to the scientific report, issued on November 5, 1993, or to any drafts
or other product derived from the preparation of that report, in presenting any oral statement or written comment;
and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Individuals or organizations cannot attempt to bolster their oral or written comments or opinions by reference
to the scientific report as authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Departmental hearing officer at the hearing on January 13, 1994, will be authorized to terminate the opportunity
to speak of any person making a statement if, in the judgment of the hearing officer, that person disregards the instructions
not to address the scientific report or its contents. Written comments or materials that contain information that
violates the above restrictions will be marked and thereafter excluded from the administrative record while the
court restrictions remain in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service intends that any final action resulting from the proposed rule will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Except for the court-imposed restrictions set out above, the Service encourages the submission of all individual
scientific opinions, biological data, and other relevant scientific data that will assist in arriving at the ``best
scientific and commercial data available,'' as mandated by Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend its regulations to establish Reference Daily Intakes
(RDI's) for vitamin K, selenium, chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum for use in declaring the
nutrient content of a food on its label or labeling; change the units of measure for biotin, folate, calcium, and phosphorus;
and make consideration of selenium, molybdenum, fluoride, and chromium optional when determining nutritional
inferiority. The agency is taking this action to assist consumers in understanding the nutritional significance
of the levels of these nutrients in the context of the total daily diet and in recognition of the fact that the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS) has established Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA's) or Estimated Safe and Adequate
Daily Dietary Intakes (ESADDI's) for these nutrients.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 19, 1990 (55 FR 29476), in a document entitled ``Food Labeling; Reference Daily Intakes and Daily Reference
Values'' (hereinafter referred to as the July 1990 proposal), FDA proposed to amend its food labeling regulations
by revising and expanding the list of label reference values for nutrients in foods that it had established. This list
was known as the ``U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances'' (U.S. RDA's) (&sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv) (21 CFR 101.9(c)(7)(iv)).
The agency proposed to replace the U.S. RDA's with RDI's for protein and 26 vitamins and minerals for which RDA's or
ESADDI's were provided in the 9th and 10th Editions of NAS' ``Recommended Dietary Allowances'' (proposed &sect;101.9(c)(11)(iv)
(56 FR 60366 at 60390)). FDA proposed to establish RDI's for vitamins and minerals for five groups: Adults and children
4 or more years of age, children less than 4 years of age, infants, pregnant women, and lactating women. It also proposed
to establish Daily Reference Values (DRV's) for eight nutrients and food components (i.e., total fat, saturated
fat, unsaturated fat, cholesterol, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sodium, and potassium) for adults and children
4 or more years of age.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the comment period on this proposal, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Nutrition Labeling
and Education Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535) (hereinafter known as ``the 1990 amendments''). In response to this
new law, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 27, 1991 (56 FR 60366, and corrected at 57 FR 8178, March 6, 1992), FDA issued a document entitled ``Food
Labeling: Reference Daily Intakes and Daily Reference Values; Mandatory Status of Nutrition Labeling and Nutrient
Content Revision'' (hereinafter referred to as ``the supplementary proposal''). In that document, FDA republished
and supplemented the July 1990 proposal and a proposal on nutrition labeling that FDA had also published in July of
1990 to make clear that in the agency's view, with some modifications, these proposals addressed the requirements
of the 1990 amendments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received approximately 800 responses to the July 1990 proposal, and approximately 700 responses to that part
of the supplementary proposal that addressed the RDI's and DRV's, from trade and retail associations, government
organizations, retailers, consumer groups, State groups, private organizations, professional societies, and
universities. Each of the responses contained one or more comments. FDA summarized and reviewed these comments in
the final rule entitled ``Food Labeling; Reference Daily Intakes and Daily Reference Values'' that it published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2206, and corrected at 58 FR 17104, April 1, 1993) (hereinafter referred to as ``the RDI/DRV
final rule'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, on October 6, 1992, before FDA issued a final rule in response to the July 1990 and the supplemental proposals,
Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;571) (hereinafter referred to as the ``DS act'').
Section 202(a)(1) of the DS act established a moratorium on the implementation of the 1990 amendments with respect
to dietary supplements of vitamins, minerals, herbs, or other similar nutritional substances (hereinafter referred
to as ``dietary supplements'') until December 15, 1993. Section 203 of the DS act prohibited FDA from promulgating
before November 8, 1993, regulations that require the use of, or that are based upon, recommended daily allowances
of vitamins or minerals, other than regulations establishing the United States recommended daily allowances specified
in &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv) as in effect on October 6, 1992. The label values in &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv) were based,
to a large extent, on the 1968 RDA's and thus were almost 25 years old. Nonetheless, with its discretion constrained
by section 203 of the DS act but faced with a need to establish a labeling scheme that manufacturers could implement
as quickly as possible, FDA simply adopted the values in &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv) as in effect in 1992 in its new regulations
(see the RDI/DRV final rule).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, this solution created a new set of problems. Section 101.9(c)(7)(iv) as in effect in 1992, and the 1968 RDA's
that it was based on (Ref. 1), did not contain reference values for a number of nutrients that were included in the 1989
RDA's (Ref. 2). Thus, there is no provision in the RDI's for a number of nutrients whose importance for good nutrition
has been generally accepted. To remedy this situation, FDA is proposing to establish RDI's for these nutrients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not proposing to change the RDI levels for those nutrients for which it has already established RDI's. FDA recognizes
that there is active debate within the scientific community as to the basis on which such levels should be established,
and therefore, the agency considers it premature to modify its current levels. However, FDA believes that at least
the list of nutrients for which it has RDI's, if not the RDI levels themselves, should reflect scientific consensus.
Therefore, FDA is proposing to establish RDI's for seven additional nutrients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Authority for Additional Label Reference Values
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section (2)(b)(1)(A) of the 1990 amendments states that nutrition label information shall be conveyed in a manner
that, among other things, enables the public to understand its relative significance in the context of a total daily
diet. In the legislative history of this provision, Congress stated that this provision requires the Secretary to
specify requirements that would permit the consumer to understand the nutrition information pertaining to a particular
food in relation to recommended dietary information (H. Rept. 101&hyph;538, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 18 (1990)). Thus,
FDA has required that a presentation of the percent of the daily value of the nutrients listed in the nutrition label
be a fundamental part of the nutrition label format (see 58 FR 2079 at 2123 through 2135). Given the approach that FDA
has taken, it is clear that the more nutrients for which RDI's or DRV's are clearly established, the easier it will be
for consumers to understand information about that nutrient in the context of the total daily diet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the RDI/DRV final rule, FDA stated that over the last 20 years, there have been significant advances in scientific
knowledge with respect to essential nutrient requirements (58 FR 2206). In 1980, NAS established ESADDI values for
vitamin K, biotin, pantothenic acid, copper, manganese, fluoride, chromium, selenium, molybdenum, sodium, potassium,
and chloride for the first time (Ref. 3). These suggested intake values were based on less complete scientific data
than the RDA values and were regarded as more tentative and evolutionary (Ref. 3). In 1989, NAS updated the values for
vitamin K and selenium, making them RDA's rather than EASDDI's (Ref. 2). At that time, NAS continued to provide ESADDI
values for manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum but dropped the suggested values for sodium, potassium,
and chloride, giving instead estimated minimum requirements for healthy persons at various ages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Thus, given the usefulness of RDI values in conveying the information that Congress has said should be conveyed by
nutrition labeling, and given the fact that NAS has developed the basis for RDI's that are not included on the current
list, FDA tentatively concludes that it is appropriate to establish reference values for these seven nutrients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. The Need for Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;101.9(c)(8) that becomes effective May 8, 1994, only those vitamins and minerals for which FDA has established
label reference values may be listed in the nutrition labels of food in conventional food form. FDA proposed to take
a similar position with respect to nutrition labeling of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals (58 FR 33715,
June 18, 1993). Several comments on the dietary supplement proposal argued, however, that because RDA's or ESADDI's
have been established by NAS for vitamin K, selenium, manganese, fluoride, chromium, molybdenum, and chloride,
manufacturers of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals should be allowed to declare these nutrients in products'
nutrition labels with an asterisk in the ``Percent Daily Value'' column. The comments suggested that the asterisk
refer to a footnote stating ``No Daily Value has been established.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on its consideration of these comments and because the format that FDA proposed for dietary supplements of vitamins
and minerals provides for the listing of quantitative amounts for vitamins and minerals (in contrast to the format
for the nutrition labeling of foods in conventional food form, which provides for only a listing of the percent of the
daily value for each vitamin and mineral provided by the food), FDA provided for the listing of these nutrients in the
manner that was suggested by these comments in the final rule entitled ``Food Labeling; Requirement for Nutrient
Content Claims for Dietary Supplements of Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs, and Other Similar Nutritional Substances,''
published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, as an ultimate matter, FDA considers this solution to be deficient in two respects. First, even on dietary
supplements of vitamins and minerals, this solution provides no basis for a declaration of the percent of the daily
value for these nutrients, information that is, as stated above, important for consumers in putting the information
presented in the nutrition label in the context of the total daily diet. Second, the agency's action with respect to
dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals does nothing to provide information on the levels of these nutrients
in foods whose labeling is subject to &sect;101.9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the comments on the proposed rule on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements (58 FR 33715 at 33731)
pointed to a third type of problem created by the lack of reference values for the nutrients in question. Several of
those comments requested that nutrient content claims be allowed for all vitamins or minerals for which NAS has established
RDA's or ESADDI's. These comments could not be readily accommodated, however, because, as explained in the final
rule on nutrient content claims for dietary supplements published elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, FDA's regulations define terms such as ``high'' and ``good source'' based on the RDI or DRV for the nutrient that is
the subject of the claim. This approach has the advantage of linking nutrient content claims to established reference
values that provide a consistent, quantitative basis for the claims. However, because the agency's current list
of RDI's and DRV's does not reflect the entire list of nutrients for which dietary recommendations have been established,
no claims can be made about nutrients whose essentiality is generally recognized unless the list of nutrients with
RDI's is updated as quickly as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, FDA is proposing to establish RDI's for vitamin K, selenium, chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium, and
molybdenum for three reasons. First, it will permit the declaration of these nutrients in the nutrition labeling
of all foods. Second, it will permit consumers of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals, as well as other foods
that contain these nutrients in significant amounts, to understand the amount of these nutrients present in these
products in the context of the total daily diet. Third, it will permit nutrient content claims to be made for these nutrients
on all foods.

IV. The Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Basis for RDI's for Vitamin K, Selenium, Chloride, Manganese, Fluoride, Chromium, and Molybdenum
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has determined that NAS RDA's are an appropriate basis for label reference values. Strong and uniform support
was provided for the use of NAS RDA's during the initial development of label reference values in 1972 as well as in response
to the July 1990 proposal and the supplementary proposal. The agency continues to believe that these established
nutrient allowances are the most widely accepted and respected source of information on human nutrient requirements
and recommended intakes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In proposing RDI's for these seven nutrients, the agency recognizes that if it adopts this proposal, some label reference
values will be based on the 1968 NAS RDA's, while others will be based on the 1980 and 1989 NAS RDA's. The agency believes,
however, that providing label information regarding the seven additional nutrients covered by the proposal would
be useful to consumers in making healthy dietary choices. As discussed in the previous section, without RDI's, there
can be no percent Daily Values expressed for these nutrients on the nutrition label, and nutrient content claims cannot
be made for them. Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that the advantages of having a reference value for all nutrients
that NAS has found to be essential outweighs any disadvantages that derive from the fact that some of these values are
more reflective of current scientific thinking than others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, NAS is in the process of reevaluating the basis on which RDA's are determined. NAS is considering whether
values should be selected to prevent deficiencies or to promote optimal wellness. The agency believes that any action
to establish a set of RDI's with consistent derivation should await completion of the NAS process. FDA is committed
to working with NAS to help resolve this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Determination of Reference Amounts for Vitamin K, Selenium, Chloride, Manganese, Fluoride, Chromium, and Molybdenum
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on its consideration of comments on the 1990 proposal and on the supplementary proposal, FDA determined in the
RDI/DRV final rule that there is considerable support for the general approach of establishing label reference values
for vitamins and minerals by selecting the highest NAS RDA value from among those for persons 4 or more years of age (excluding
pregnant and lactating females) (58 FR 2206 at 2211). The comments stated that vulnerable or at-risk groups would
be sufficiently covered by selecting the highest value. Therefore, in the RDI/DRV final rule, FDA tentatively determined
that in establishing label reference values from NAS' RDA values, it would be appropriate to select the highest value
from among those for adults and children 4 or more years of age, excluding values for pregnant females and lactating
females (58 FR 2206 at 2211). FDA referred to this approach as the ``population coverage approach.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to use this approach in adopting RDI's for vitamin K, selenium, chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium,
and molybdenum. In doing so, the agency is setting forth a quantitative amount as well as a unit of measure for each nutrient.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to vitamin K, a review of the 1989 RDA values shows a range of recommended levels from 20 micrograms (&mu;g)
for children 4 to 6 years of age to 80 &mu;g for adult males from 25 to 51+ years of age (Ref. 2). Accordingly, using the
population coverage approach, FDA is proposing to adopt 80 &mu;g as the RDI for vitamin K.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the 1989 RDA values for selenium shows a range of recommended levels from 20 &mu;g for children 4 to 6 years
of age to 70 &mu;g for adult males from 19 to 51+ years of age (Ref. 2). Using the population coverage approach, FDA is
proposing to adopt 70 &mu;g as the RDI for selenium.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the 1980 ESADDI values for chloride shows a range from 700 to 2,100 milligrams (mg) for children 4 to 6 years
of age to 1,700 to 5,100 mg for adults (Ref. 3). To be consistent with the population coverage approach being used for
vitamins and minerals with RDA's, FDA said in the RDI/DRV final rule that when nutrients had ESADDI values, it would
select the highest ESADDI within the specified age groups to serve as the label reference value. When the ESADDI value
is presented as a range, FDA said it would use the midpoint of that range as the RDI. No comments were received that objected
to this approach (58 FR 2206 at 2212). Therefore, in accordance with this procedure, FDA is proposing to adopt 3,400
mg (the midpoint between 1,700 to 5,100 mg) as the RDI for chloride.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A review of the 1989 ESADDI values for manganese shows a range from 1.5 to 2.0 mg for children 4 to 6 years of age to 2.0 to
5.0 mg for adults (Ref. 2). Consistent with the procedure discussed above, FDA is proposing to adopt 3.5 mg (the midpoint
between 2.0 to 5.0 mg) as the RDI for manganese.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For fluoride, a review of the 1989 ESADDI values shows a range from 1.0 to 2.5 mg for children 4 to 6 years of age to 1.5 to
4.0 mg for adults. Consistent with the procedure discussed above, FDA is proposing to adopt 3.0 mg (rounding the midpoint
between 1.5 to 4.0 mg, 2.75 mg, to 3.0 mg) as the RDI for fluoride.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For chromium, a review of the 1989 ESADDI values shows a range from 30 to 120 &mu;g for children 4 to 6 years of age to 50
to 200 &mu;g for adults and children 7 or more years of age. In accordance with the population coverage approach, FDA
is proposing to adopt 130 &mu;g (rounding the midpoint between 50 to 200 &mu;g, 125 &mu;g, to 130 &mu;g) as the RDI for
chromium.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, a review of the 1989 ESADDI values for molybdenum shows a range from 30 to 75 &mu;g for children 4 to 6 years of
age to 75 to 250 &mu;g for adults and children 11 or more years of age. In accordance with the population coverage approach,
FDA is proposing to adopt 160 &mu;g (rounding the midpoint between 75 to 250 &mu;g, 162.5 &mu;g, to 160 &mu;g) as the
RDI for molybdenum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv) to include the following values:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Vitamin K, 80 micrograms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selenium, 70 micrograms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chloride, 3,400 milligrams
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manganese, 3.5 milligrams
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fluoride, 3.0 milligrams
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chromium, 130 micrograms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Molybdenum, 160 micrograms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One comment to the proposal on nutrition labeling for dietary supplements recommended that biotin and folate be declared
in terms of micrograms, not milligrams, and that calcium and phosphorus be declared in terms of milligrams instead
of grams. The comment stated that consumers are more familiar with these nutrients being expressed in this manner.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA proposed in 1990 (56 FR 29476) to use the units suggested by this comment. However, section 203 of the DS act limited
the values that FDA could use in establishing RDI's to those contained in &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv) until after November
8, 1993. Accordingly, as stated above, FDA adopted the current U.S. RDA values as the RDI's, with biotin and folate
expressed in terms of milligrams, and calcium and phosphorus expressed in terms of grams. Public health guidelines
and nutrition education efforts typically use the same units of measure as those found in the 10th Edition of NAS' RDA
and repeated in the 1990 proposal. Therefore, the agency agrees with the comment that changing the current units of
measure of biotin, folate, calcium, and phosphorus to those units specified in the 1990 proposal will facilitate
consumer comprehension of quantitative nutrient information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv) by changing the units of measure for biotin, folate,
calcium, and phosphorus to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
biotin-micrograms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
folate-micrograms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calcium-milligrams
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phosphorus-milligrams
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA points out that in following the provisions of the DS act and retaining the label reference values in current &sect;101.9(c)(7)(iv),
it did not adopt label reference values in the RDI/DRV final rule for use on foods purported to be or represented for
use by infants, children under 4 years of age, or pregnant or lactating women. Given the continuing questions about
how to arrive at such values, FDA is deferring action on this issue with respect to the issue of updating the RDI's. FDA
intends to propose RDI's for all nutrients, including vitamin K, selenium, chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium,
and molybdenum, for infants, children under 4 years of age, and pregnant and lactating women in a future rulemaking.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of the lack of reference values for infants, children under 4 years of age, and pregnant and lactating women,
labels of dietary supplements of vitamins or minerals that are intended for these specific groups and that are regulated
under &sect;101.36 (21 CFR 101.36) may continue to specify the milligram or microgram amounts of these nutrients
with an asterisk in the percent Daily Value column. The asterisk would refer to a footnote stating ``Daily Value not
established.'' However, since milligram and microgram amounts are not listed for vitamins and minerals on labels
of foods in conventional food form, until such time as RDA's are established for infants, children less than 4 years
of age, and pregnant and lactating women, and barring a significant change in agency position in the final rule in this
proceeding, the seven subject nutrients may not be declared on labels of foods in conventional food form that are represented
or purported to be for use by these groups. FDA requests comment on whether or not this position is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One possible alternative would be to allow foods in conventional food form that are represented or purported to be
for use by infants, children less than 4 years of age, or pregnant and lactating women to list vitamin K, selenium, chloride,
manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum when they are present in the food in more than insignificant amounts
but without milligram or microgram amounts, only an asterisk that refers to a footnote stating that a Daily Value has
not been established. This alternative would alert consumers to the presence of these nutrients in the food, although
it would not give any indication of the amount present. FDA solicits comment on this and other alternative approaches.

C. Issues Concerning Specific Nutrients
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. GRAS Status of Selenium, Fluoride, and Chromium
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the RDI/DRV final rule, FDA reviewed several comments expressing concern about the GRAS status of selenium, fluoride,
and chromium (58 FR 2206 at 2215). These comments centered primarily around issues of their use in supplements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the agency stated in the final rule on mandatory nutrition labeling (58 FR 2079 at 2170), decisions with regard to
whether the use of sources of these nutrients is GRAS are outside the scope of this rulemaking. Any direct addition
of these trace minerals to a food is based on the manufacturer's judgment that use of the nutrient sources is GRAS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Alternative Products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The RDI/DRV final rule also addressed the effect of the label reference values on alternative products (e.g., reduced
fat foods). One comment suggested that with a larger number of vitamins and minerals listed in &sect;101.9(c)(8),
selected vitamins and minerals should be removed from the list of nutrients that, under &sect;101.3(e)(4)(ii) (21
CFR 101.3(e)(4)(ii)), must be present at the same level in a substitute food if that food is to be considered not nutritionally
inferior to the food for which it substitutes and resembles (58 FR 2206 at 2225). The agency acknowledged that an increase
in the number of nutrients for which label reference values (RDI's) are established would mean that efforts to obtain
nutritional equivalency may require the addition of nutrients to substitute foods (58 FR 2206 at 2225).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In considering this comment, FDA acknowledged that there were no FDA-approved sources of selenium, fluoride, chromium
or molybdenum for direct addition to foods (58 FR 2206 at 2225). Since there are no listed sources for these four nutrients,
the agency stated in the RDI/DRV final rule that if RDI's had been established for these nutrients, FDA would have amended
&sect;101.3(e)(4)(ii) to state that these nutrients are not required for nutritional equivalency (58 FR 2206 at
2225).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having received no objections to this statement, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;101.3(e)(4)(ii) to state that selenium,
molybdenum, fluoride, and chromium need not be considered in determining nutritional inferiority. If adopted,
this amendment will mean that a product that substitutes for another food that contains at least 2 percent more of the
RDI for selenium, molybdenum, fluoride, or chromium will not have to be fortified with these nutrients to avoid being
an ``imitation.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency feels compelled, however, to point out that there are circumstances in which adequate amounts of selenium,
chromium, and molybdenum need to be supplied by particular foods because those foods may well be the sole item of the
diet. These foods include infant formulas, medical foods, or total diet replacement formulas. The agency notes that
selenium, molybdenum, and chromium have been used for several years in some infant formulas, medical foods, and total
diet replacement product without apparent problems. Although the agency has not determined whether the use of certain
compounds used by manufacturers of such products as sources of these nutrients is GRAS, FDA has not objected to these
additions at levels that result in daily intakes that do not exceed the upper limits of the NAS' ESADDI's.

V. Conforming Amendments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revision of the nutrition labeling regulations in &sect;101.9 to provide RDI's for vitamin K, selenium,
chloride, manganese, fluoride, chromium, and molybdenum necessitates that FDA revise &sect;101.36(b)(3), (b)(4),
and (b)(4)(vi) as finalized in the document entitled ``Food Labeling; General Requirements for Nutrition Labeling
for Dietary Supplements of Vitamins, Minerals, Herbs, or Other Similar Nutritional Substances'' published elsewhere
in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 101.36(b)(3) specifically provides for vitamin K, chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum,
and selenium to be listed in the nutrition label of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals when present and for
quantitative amounts of the nutrients to be declared. Section 101.36(b)(4) states that no percent of Daily Value
shall be given for these seven nutrients in the nutrition label, and &sect;101.36(b)(4)(vi) states that when no percent
is given, an asterisk shall be placed in the ``Percent Daily Value'' column in the nutrition label that refers to another
asterisk that is placed at the bottom of the nutrition label that is followed by the statement ``Daily Value not established.''
FDA is proposing to amend &sect;101.36(b)(3) to remove all references to vitamin K, chloride, chromium, fluoride,
manganese, molybdenum, and selenium. Because these nutrients are proposed to be included in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv),
they will be permitted to be listed in nutrition labeling without specific provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to &sect;101.36(b)(4) and (b)(4)(vi), once RDI's are established for vitamin K, chloride, chromium,
fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, and selenium for adults and children 4 or more years of age, the percent Daily Value
of these nutrients will be able to be calculated for this group. However, because RDI's are not being proposed for infants,
children less than 4 years of age, and for pregnant or lactating women (as discussed in section IV.C.1. of this document),
labels of products represented or purported to be for use by those groups will not be able to declare the percent Daily
Value for these nutrients. Therefore, FDA is proposing to amend &sect;101.36(b)(4) and (b)(4)(vi) to provide for
the use of an asterisk that will refer to the statement ``Daily Value not established'' for the seven subject nutrients
on products represented or purported to be for use by infants, children less than 4 years of age, and pregnant or lactating
women.

VII. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(11) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the economic implications of the proposed rule amending 21 CFR as required by Executive Order 12866
and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs
and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches
which maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects; distributive
impacts; and equity). The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that agencies analyze options for regulatory relief
for small businesses. FDA finds that this proposed rule is not a significant rule as defined by Executive Order 12866.
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small businesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed regulation allows manufacturers of foods in conventional food form and dietary supplements to declare
certain nutrients within the nutrition panel and to make content claims about those nutrients. The proposal provides
flexibility for those manufacturers who wish to disclose information about these seven nutrients without imposing
requirements on those firms producing products without these nutrients. Manufacturers of food in conventional
food form must change food labels if any of the nutrients are added to the product or if any claims are made. FDA is unsure
of the extent to which this will occur. FDA believes that the costs of this regulation are minimal. This regulation
will create benefits to the extent that the additional information allowed in nutrition labeling will help consumers
make healthy dietary choices.

(3) A listing of all nutrients required in &sect;101.9(c) that are present in the dietary supplement in quantitative
amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in &sect;101.9(c). Those nutrients that are not
present, or that are present in amounts that would be declared as zero, shall not be declared. In addition, potassium
shall be declared except when present in quantitative amounts by weight that allow a declaration of zero. The name
of each nutrient listed shall be immediately followed by the quantitative amount by weight of the nutrient. Nutrient
names and quantitative amounts shall be presented in a column under the heading ``Amount Per Serving'' and aligned
on the left side of the nutrition label. The heading ``Amount Per Serving'' shall be separated from other information
on the label by a bar above and beneath it, except that when calories are listed, the bar shall be placed beneath the calorie
declaration. When the serving size of the product is one unit (e.g., 1 tablet), a heading consistent with the declaration
of serving size, such as ``Amount per Tablet'' or ``Each Tablet Contains,'' may be used in place of the heading ``Amount
per Serving.'' Other appropriate terms, such as capsule, packet, or teaspoonful, may be used in place of the term ``Serving.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A listing of the percent of the Daily Value (i.e., the percent of the RDI as established in &sect;101.9(c)(8)(iv)
or DRV as established in &sect;101.9(c)(9)), where appropriate, of all nutrients listed in the nutrition label,
except that the percent for protein may be omitted as provided in &sect;101.9(c)(7), no percent shall be given for
sugars, and, for labels of dietary supplements of vitamins and minerals that are represented or purported to be for
use by infants, children less than 4 years of age, or pregnant or lactating women, no percent shall be given for vitamin
K, chloride, chromium, fluoride, manganese, molybdenum, or selenium. This information shall be presented in one
column aligned under the heading of ``% Daily Value'' and to the right of the column of nutrient names and amounts. The
headings ``% Daily Value (DV),'' ``% DV,'' ``Percent Daily Value,'' or ``Percent DV'' may be substituted for ``% Daily
Value.'' The heading ``% Daily Value'' shall be placed on the same line as the heading ``Amount Per Serving'' or placed
beneath this heading and the bar underneath it, except that ``% Daily Value'' shall be placed beneath this bar when
calorie information is required to be declared. Calorie information shall be placed beneath ``Amount Per Serving''
and above the bar.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The USDA, Forest Service, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to disclose the environmental effects
of vegetation retention, vegetation treatments, access management, and fish habitat enhancement in the vicinity
of White Sand Creek, Beaver Creek, Savage Creek, Rabbit Creek, and Colt Creek drainages. The area is located south
and east of the Powell Ranger Station, Powell Ranger District, Clearwater National Forest, Idaho County, Idaho.
Most of the proposed project's activities are within the North Fork Spruce - White Sand (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
1314) Roadless Areas. The proposal's actions are being considered together because they represent either connected
or cumulative actions as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR 1508.25).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purposes of the project are to implement the Clearwater Forest Plan within the context of Ecosystem Management
principles; conserve biological diversity; retain the undeveloped character of White Sand scenery; restore ecosystem
function in fire-dependant forest communities; reduce the risk of large fires and improve opportunities for use
of prescribed natural fire; create vistas and visually rehabilitate several existing harvest unit boundaries;
produce wood products and increase timber growth and yield in a way that provides long-term sustainability of both
wood products and other ecosystem elements; protect water quality, fish populations, wildlife, and roadless characteristics
influenced by access; improve safety of roads for current public use and expected increases and changes in use; enhance
trail-based recreation; and manage limiting factors that affect fish populations in White Sand streams.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This project-level EIS will tier to the Clearwater National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan)
and Final EIS (September, 1987), which provides overall guidance of all land management activities on the Clearwater
National Forest.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed action is based on the findings of the White Sand Integrated Resource and Ecosystem Analysis (IRA). The
White Sand IRA is the first analysis on the Powell Ranger District using policy direction and emerging concepts of
Ecosystem Management (EM). The overriding purpose of EM policy is to better blend the needs of people and environmental
values so that National Forests represent diverse, healthy, productive, and sustainable ecosystems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The planning area consists of approximately 40,000 acres of National Forest land located in sections 33&hyph;36
of T.37N., R.14E.; sections 13&hyph;15, 20&hyph;24 and 26&hyph;35 of T.37N., R.15E.; sections 1&hyph;3, 10&hyph;16

regeneration harvest with underburning. These prescriptions would result in harvest of about 14,418 thousand board
feet (MBF) of timber

Possible Forest Plan amendments or site-specific adjustments may be needed to implement the proposed action. For
example, the Powell District will need to seek approval to exceed the 40 acre opening limitation, to create openings
within the historic range of variation and minimize fragmentation of large blocks of old growth. Openings larger
than 40 acres would retain remnants of the original tree cover to provide structural diversity within those stands.
Possible Forest Plan amendments include:

need.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clearwater Forest Plan provides guidance for management activities within the potentially affected area through
its goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, and management area direction. The area of proposed timber harvest
and reforestation would occur within Management Areas C8S, E1, E3, A4, and M2. Timber harvest would occur only on suitable
timber land, except where needed to facilitate ecosystem burning. These areas would be harvested only to manage fuel
conditions to prevent crown fires during reintroduction of fire to fire-dependant ecosystems. Ecosystem burning
would occur within management area C6, Key Fishery Habitat. Below is a brief description of the applicable management
direction.

The Forest Service will consider a range of alternatives to the proposed action. One of these will be the ``no action''
alternative, in which none of the proposed activities would be implemented. Additional alternatives will examine
varying levels and locations for the proposed activities to achieve the proposal's purposes, as well as to respond
to the issues and other resource values.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will analyze the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. Past, present,
and projected activities on both private and National Forest lands will be considered. The EIS will disclose the analysis
of site-specific mitigation measures and their effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public participation is an important part of the project, commencing with the initial scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7),
which starts with publication of this notice and continues for the next 45 days. In addition, the public is encouraged
to visit with Forest Service officials at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. The Forest Service
will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, and local agencies, the Nez Perce Tribe,
and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed action. Public meetings
will be scheduled between now and publishing of the Draft EIS. Interested individuals and organizations are encouraged
to contact the Powell District Ranger to be added to the project mailing list to receive future newsletters related
to this project and notification of public meetings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments from the public and other agencies will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS. The scoping process will be
used to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Identify potential issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Identify major issues to be analyzed in depth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Eliminate minor issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis, such as
the Clearwater Forest Plan EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Identify alternatives to the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Identify potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e., direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Determine potential cooperating agencies and task assignments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some public comments have already been received in conjunction with the White Sand IRA. Preliminary issues identified
so far have been grouped into seven major categories: Biological Diversity and Ecosystem Management; Recreation,
Wilderness, and Roadless Areas; Water Resources and Fisheries; Wildlife; Social and Economic; Heritage Resources;
and Scenery. Issues commonly associated with effects of timber harvesting and road construction are grouped into
these seven categories. The complete list is available upon request from the Powell District Ranger. This list may
be verified, expanded, or modified based on public scoping for this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Draft EIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and available for public review
in September of 1994. At that time, the EPA will publish a Notice of Availability of the Draft EIS in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The comment period on the Draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the EPA's notice of availability appears in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It is very important that those interested in management of the White Sand area participate at that time. To be most
helpful, comments on the Draft EIS should be as site-specific as possible. The Final EIS is scheduled to be completed
by February, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

and objections are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond
to them in developing issues and alternatives.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The USDA, Forest Service, will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to disclose the environmental effects
of timber harvest, reforestation, wildlife habitat enhancement (prescribed burning), construction of low standard
haul roads, and restriction of existing roads within the lower portion of the Fortine Creek drainage. The Fortine
Creek drainage is located approximately 40 air miles northeast of Libby, Montana near the town of Fortine, Montana.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal's actions to harvest and reforest timber stands, construct and reconstruct roads, prescribed burning,
and restricting roads are being considered together because they represent either connected or cumulative actions
as defined by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR 1508.25). The purposes of the project are to maintain and
enhance winter thermal habitat requirements for whitetailed and mule deer, improve grizzly bear habitat by providing
security, cover, and forage, and maintain a healthy forest while providing timber to the local economy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will tier to the Kootenai National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan and Final EIS of September 1987,
which provides overall guidance for achieving the desired forest condition of the area. All activities associated
with the proposal will be designed to maintain high quality wildlife, fisheries, and watershed objectives.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The decision area contains approximately 15,000 acres within the Kootenai National Forest in Lincoln County, Montana.
All of the proposed projects are located in the Fortine Creek drainage with sub-drainages of Deep, Brimstone, and
Murphy Creeks included. The legal location of the decision area is as follows: Sections 8, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, and 34 of Township 35 North, Range 25 West; Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29 of Township 34 North, Range 25 West; Sections 25 and 36 of Township
35 North, Range 26 West; and Sections 1 and 12 of Township 34 North, Range 26 West; Principal Montana Meridian.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some timber management and prescribed wildlife burning activities under consideration would occur within the Marston
Face Roadless Area X172 and the Thompson-Seton Roadless Area 483. No proposed activities are located in areas considered
for inclusion to the National Wilderness System as recommended by the Kootenai National Forest Plan or by any past
or present legislative wilderness proposals. Both even-aged and uneven-aged management would be used in implementing
the proposed actions. Logging systems consist of tractor harvest only.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service proposes to harvest approximately 3.3 million board feet of timber through application of a variety
of harvest methods on approximately 1063 acres of forest land. The proposal also includes prescribed burning of 117
acres to enhance wildlife habitat. The Forest Service proposal also includes approximately 2.1 miles of new road
construction (0.9 miles of temporary road and 1.2 miles of low standard specified road) and approximately 1.0 mile
of road re-construction to access the specific harvest units. Approximately 15&hyph;18 miles of existing road is
also proposed for additional road use restrictions to improve wildlife habitat security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Kootenai National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan provides overall management objectives in individual
delineated management areas (MA's). The proposed projects encompass three predominant MA's; 11, 13, and 14. Briefly
described, MA 11 is managed to maintain or enhance the winter-range habitat effectiveness for big-game species and
produce a programmed yield of timber. MA 14 focuses on maintaining or enhancing grizzly bear habitat, reducing grizzly/human
conflicts, assisting in the recovery of the grizzly bear, realizing a programmed yield of timber production, and
providing for the maintenance or enhancement of other wildlife species, especially big-game. MA 13 is designated
to provide the special habitat necessary for old growth dependent wildlife. Timber harvest is proposed only in MA
11. Prescribed burning for wildlife is the only activity proposed in MA 14. No activity is proposed in MA 13.

Public Involvement and Scoping
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public participation to this point has been extensive. On August 15, 1991 an initial scoping meeting was held with
the local community and interested individuals for the development of a timber sale proposal. On May 28, 1992 we held
another open house to present a revised proposal. In addition, a field trip to the Murphy Decision Area was conducted
on June 26, 1992 with seven individuals attending. Comments were requested in writing during all of these public involvement
efforts. Consultation with appropriate State and Federal agencies has been initiated. Preliminary effects analysis
indicated that the proposed action may significantly affect quality of the human environment and may substantially
alter the undeveloped character of the Marston Face Roadless Area. These potential effects prompted the decision
to prepare an EIS for the Murphy Timber Sales.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This environmental analysis and decision making process will unable additional interested and affected people
to participate and contribute to the final decision. Public participation will be requested at several points during
the analysis. The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State, local
agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested in or affected by the proposed projects. This
input will be used in preparation of the draft and final EIS. The scoping process will include:

The final EIS is scheduled to be completed by December, 1994. In the final EIS, the Forest Service is required to respond
to comments and responses received during the comment period that pertain to the environmental consequences discussed
in the draft EIS and applicable laws, regulations, and policies considered in making a decision regarding the proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft environmental impact
statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider and respond to them in the final
EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be most helpful, comments on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement
or the merit of the alternatives discussed. Reviewers may wish to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations
for implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing
these points.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institute of Standards and Technology seeks industrial and academic parties interested in entering
into a cooperative research consortium on the development of open systems technology for virtual libraries and electronic
document interchange. NIST wishes to pursue interoperable and portable open systems that will improve the use of
information technology in conducting government programs and in providing services to the public, and, in particular,
improve the use and exchange of electronic documents in many forms as an aid to the performance of daily business activities
and research activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The open information systems movement is gaining momentum because many researchers and users realize that no single
vendor can supply all the needs for an information-based society. Open systems are needed to provide for interoperability
of software, hardware, and communications systems products, and for portability of data and applications across
heterogeneous computing environments. While there is a strong movement to standards for interconnecting hardware,
software and network systems, there are many proprietary products and systems in use. NIST has developed the application
Portability Profile (APP), the U.S. Government's Open system Environment Profile, which integrates standards
and other specifications to address a broad range of information technology requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this consortium is to develop technology that will promote the exchange of electronic documents and
improve user access to information in various forms and locations. This technology will fit into the APP framework.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This program is being undertaken within the scope and confines of the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (Pub.
L. 99&hyph;502, 15 U.S.C. 3710a) which authorizes government owned and operated federal laboratories, including
NIST, to enter into cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) with qualified parties. Under the
law, a CRADA may provide for contributions from the federal laboratory of personnel, facilities, and equipment,
but not direct funding.

The Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act) requires that each Regional Fishery Management
Council submit any fishery management plan or plan amendment it prepares to the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary)
for review and approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval. The Magnuson Act also requires that the Secretary,
upon receiving a fishery management plan or amendment, immediately publish a notice that the fishery management
plan or amendment is available for public review and comment. The Secretary will consider the public comments received
during the comment period in determining public comments received during the comment period in determining whether
to approve the FMP or amendment.

Amendment 32 would establish a plan to rebuild stocks of the rockfish Pacific ocean perch (POP) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes alutus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). POP is a highly valued groundfish. It was heavily exploited by a foreign trawl fleet from
the early 1960's until the mid-1980's. Thereafter, a domestic at-sea processing fleet harvested POP at a substantially
lower rate. Catches of POP peaked in 1965 when an estimated 350,000 metric tons (mt) were harvested by the foreign fleet;
catches declined sharply in the late 1960's. From 1961&hyph;1977, annual POP landings averaged over 40,000 mt; after
1977, landings averaged 6,000 mt. In the domestic fishery, POP was managed as part of a larger slope rockfish assemblage
of about 20 species until 1991, when POP was established as a separate target species category to prevent possible
overfishing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of increased concern about the status of POP stocks, biomass assessment methodology has been improved
and domestic harvest levels have been reduced. The 1993 total allowable catch (TAC) of 2,560 mt was available only
as incidental catch in other groundfish fisheries. In recent years POP has been managed as a single species, harvest
levels have been reduced, and directed fisheries have been restricted or eliminated. In spite of this conservative
management in recent years, POP biomass has increased only slightly and remains depressed from historic levels.
The current spawner biomass of about 71,000 mt is estimated to be 15&hyph;20 percent of the level observed during the
1960's.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council believes that increasing the biomass of POP to a level closer to historical amounts is necessary to achieve
optimum yield in the POP fishery. Factors other than fishing mortality contribute to the continued depressed state
of the POP resource. Ecosystem changes or other biological factors may preclude rebuilding success. Nevertheless,
the Council considers minimizing POP mortality necessary to maximize the probability of rebuilding success in a
realistic time period. Additionally, decreasing POP mortality should minimize resource waste associated with
low TACs that do not fully accommodate incidental catch needs of existing fisheries.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a review of alternatives analyzed in the EA, the Council selected Alternative 3 as the preferred alternative.
This alternative is projected in modeling simulations to rebuild POP biomass to a target level (B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
MSY
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in about 14 years by harvesting POP at a fishing mortality rate lower than the optimum rate. The target biomass B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
MSY
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the total biomass of mature females that would produce the maximum sustainable yield, on average; this number is
currently estimated at 150,000 mt. The optimal fishing mortality rate is the rate that maximizes expected biological
and economic yields over a range of plausible stock-recruitment relationships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council considered Alternative 3 superior to Alternative 1, which no longer represents the best scientific information
about POP biomass and population dynamics. The Council also considered Alternative 3 superior to Alternative 2,
which would harvest POP at the higher optimal fishing mortality rate. The Council believed that lower POP harvests
and additional economic costs of Alternative 3 were justified because Alternative 2 would achieve the target biomass
in a longer time (about 18 years) and with a lower probability of rebuilding success. Alternative 4 would harvest POP
at a lower rate equivalent needed for unavoidable POP bycatch in remaining groundfish fisheries, at 1992 bycatch
rates. The TACs resulting from Alternative 4 were considered too restrictive in relation to existing POP bycatch
needs, causing unnecessary discards of POP that are killed in fishing operations after POP TACs are reached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Alternative 3, the FMP would establish the procedure for deriving the annual GOA TACs for POP. POP stocks are
considered to be rebuilt when the total biomass of mature females is equal to, or greater than, B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
MSY
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Annual TACs would be established as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Determine the current biomass, B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
MSY
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and the optimal fishing mortality rate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Determine the fishing mortality rate halfway between the optimal fishing mortality rate and the fishing mortality
rate estimated to be sufficient to supply unavoidable bycatch of POP based on 1992 bycatch rates;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) When the current biomass of mature females is less than B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
MSY
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, adjust the resultant fishing mortality rate in (b) by the ratio of current biomass to B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
MSY
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 so that when B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
MSY
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is attained, the fishing mortality rate will be the optimal fishing mortality rate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The GOA TAC of POP is the amount of fish resulting from the adjusted fishing mortality rate in (c); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The TAC is apportioned among regulatory areas in proportion to POP biomass distribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to restricting the annual fishing mortality rate of POP, the Council seeks to reduce the total mortality
of POP in other target fisheries. In the past, overfishing has been defined GOA-wide. Under Amendment 32, the overfishing
level would be distributed among the eastern, central, and western areas in the same proportions as POP biomass occurs
in those areas. This measure would avoid localized depletion of POP and would rebuild POP at equal rates in all regulatory
areas of the GOA. The Council considers this management option necessary because, although POP biomass is greatest
in the Eastern Regulatory Area, most trawl fishing activity and incidental catch of POP is greatest in the Central
Regulatory Area. With an acceptable biological catch as low as the current, 3,378 mt in 1993, fishing mortality of
POP can be expected to exceed the TAC available in the central GOA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 32 is necessary to improve conservation and management of POP and is intended to further the goals and objectives
of the FMP. No regulatory changes are necessary to implement this FMP amendment because the FMP would provide the procedure
for deriving TACs for POP, which are specified annually under existing regulations at &sect;672.20(a)(2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 21, 1993, President Clinton signed the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993, that merged
the Commission on National and Community Service, ACTION, and the newly established Civilian Community Corps, to
create the Corporation for National and Community Service. The Corporation is presenting a series of regional workshops
in Washington, DC, Atlanta, Kansas City, and Los Angeles, to provide application assistance to organizations applying
for national and community service program grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Functioning as a service ``venture capitalist'', the Corporation will provide funding on a population-based formula
and competitive basis for national and community service programs, and as a clearinghouse of information and technical
expertise for service initiatives nationwide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To encourage broad participation in national service, the Corporation is conducting this series of workshops to
support the application of high quality, national service programs and service-learning K&hyph;12 and higher education
programs. Approximately $189 million will be available to these programs, to assist in the planning, operating and
replicating of national and community service programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary audience for these workshops will be those applying directly to the Corporation, including State Commissions
or alternative entities, State educational agencies, higher education institutions, Indian Tribes, territories,
Federal agencies, professional corps, national nonprofits, and multi-State organizations. State Commissions
will be responsible for providing technical assistance to local applicants applying to their States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, those local nonprofits organizations, government agencies, Indian Tribes, and higher education institutions
interested in applying for Summer of Safety should attend. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those who are unable to attend the workshops, the corporation will be sponsoring other assistance programs, including
tele/video-conferences and printed material. Please contact the Corporation at (202) 606&hyph;5000, or FAX (202)
606&hyph;4845, for additional information on national service programs.

 (53 FR 23783&hyph;23784) of June 24, 1988, that a demonstration project, called the CHAMPUS Reform Initiative (CRI),
would be conducted by contract under the provisions of chapter 55, title 10, section 1092, to test a different method
for financing and delivering health services under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services
(CHAMPUS). Delivery of services under that contract began August 1, 1988, for all beneficiaries who reside in the
states of California and Hawaii, and is scheduled to end January 31, 1994. The TRICARE demonstration project in California
and Hawaii is a continuation of the CRI demonstration project and includes five option periods, the execution of which
would result in five years of service delivery under the new contract. An evaluation of the significant new features
of the demonstration will be conducted. The objectives of the demonstration are to enhance beneficiary access and
continuity of care, contain health care costs, and improve coordination between the military and civilian components
of the Military Health Services System (MHSS).

<DOCTITLE>Partial Record of Decision (ROD) for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton Air Force Base (AFB), CA</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 15, 1993, the Air Force signed the Partial ROD for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton AFB. The decisions included
in this partial ROD have been made in consideration of, but not limited to, the information contained in the Final Environmental
Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Disposal and Reuse of Norton AFB, filed with the Environmental Protection Agency
on June 4, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Norton AFB will formally close on March 31, 1994, pursuant to the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure
and Realignment Act (BRAC) (Public Law 100&hyph;526) and recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission
on Base Realignment and Closure. Pending closure of Norton AFB, this ROD documents the decisions made by the Air Force
on the division of parcels, the method parcels are to be conveyed or transferred, and the mitigation measures to be
adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary decision in this ROD is to dispose of the aviation-related portion of Norton AFB in a manner that will enable
the development of a regional airport with the capacity for expanding commercial and industrial development. The
portion of the base covered by this ROD has been divided into ten (10) parcels. The airport parcel, including four (4)
non aviation revenue producing parcels, will be conveyed at no-cost via public benefit conveyance for airport purposes.
Three (3) parcels are to be offered for negotiated sale, and two (2) parcels will be reserved for transfer to another
Federal Agency. The Air Force decided to defer decisions on roads, utilities, and portions of Norton AFB not covered
by this ROD pending further analysis and review. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has jurisdiction by law
regarding reuse of the runways and associated facilities as a civilian airport. A decision, if any, by the FAA to approve
an airport layout plan (ALP) will be announced by a separate ROD issued by the FAA based on the analysis in the FEIS and
any additional FAA analysis that may be required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation of the closure and reuse action and associated mitigation measures will proceed with minimal
adverse impact to the environment. This action conforms with applicable Federal, State and local statutes and regulations.
All reasonable and practical efforts have been incorporated to minimize harm to the local public and environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. John E. B. Smith or Ms. De Carlo Ciccel at (703) 696&hyph;5534.
Correspondence should be sent to: AFBCA/SP, 1700 North Moore Street, suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209&hyph;2802.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Record of Decision (ROD) states the Army's intention to dispose of Fort Ord property, establish a Presidio of Monterey
Annex, and retain the existing reserve center at Fort Ord. Because the local communities' reuse plan has not been finalized,
the Army does not adopt a specific plan in this ROD. Rather, in this document the Army certifies that it has adequately
analyzed the environmental impacts of its decision to dispose of property at Fort Ord.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the President's Five-Point Initiative to Revitalize Base Closure Communities, the Army will dispose
of property in accordance with the local communities' reuse plan to the maximum extent possible. The Army will develop,
if necessary, additional environmental analysis following this ROD to address the impacts of those uses in the local
communities' reuse plan not already addressed in the Environmental Impact Statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this ROD, the Army will initiate the property disposal process at Fort Ord consistent with the analysis in

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for the proposed sanitary sewer project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory
(ORNL) prepared in accordance with 10 CFR 1022. DOE proposes to upgrade the sanitary sewer system to provide adequate
service in the main complex area and outlying regions of the Oak Ridge Reservation. Only certain sections of two subprojects
would be located in a 100-year floodplain. The East Area Sewer Main subproject would include installing approximately
2,900 linear feet of new sewer line that would lie within the 100-year floodplain of White Oak Creek located near Oak
Ridge, Tennessee. This line would be installed in a trench about 2 feet deep. After installation, the trench would
be backfilled and compacted. Finally, the area would be graded to original contour and seeded. The Sewer Main to Outlying
Areas subproject would install approximately 8,300 linear feet of new pipeline. The new pipeline would be located
in the 100-year floodplain of White Oak Creek only where the pipeline crosses White Oak Creek and an unnamed tributary
feeding the creek from the west. At these crossings, the pipeline would be placed on the existing causeways and adjacent
to the roadway. After installation, the area would be returned to the original condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE prepared a floodplain and wetlands assessment describing the effects, alternatives, and measures designed
to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplain. DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public
review after publication of the Statement of Findings before implementing the proposed action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for the proposed sanitary sewer upgrade project at ORNL. A Notice of Floodplain/Wetlands
Involvement was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51624). DOE proposes to upgrade the sanitary sewer system to provide adequate service in the
main complex area and outlying regions of the reservation. These upgrades are needed because of the deterioration
in portions of the system, which are approaching 50-years of age; restrictive bends in sections of the piping; excessive
surface and subsurface infiltration during heavy rains; infiltration of ground water; high cost and potential environmental
damage of collecting, pumping, and hauling sanitary waste from holding tanks in the outlying areas; and lack of reserve
capacity during peak periods of use. Of the proposed upgrades, only certain sections of two subprojects would be located
in a 100-year floodplain. These subprojects would be the East Area Sewer Main and the Sewer Main to Outlying Areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The East Area Sewer Main subproject would include the installation of approximately 2,900 linear feet of new sewer
line that would lie within the 100-year floodplain of White Oak Creek. This line would be installed in a trench about
2 feet deep. After installation, the trench would be backfilled and compacted. Finally, the area would be graded to
original contour and seeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, facilities in the outlying areas of the plant use either collection tanks or septic systems. The waste
in the tanks is routinely pumped into trucks and taken to the main treatment plant. The cost of collection and maintenance
of the sanitary facilities in the outlying areas continues to increase. Additionally, this existing system can negatively
affect the environment. The objective of the Sewer Main to Outlying Areas subproject is to directly connect, via a
pipeline, these facilities to the main sewage treatment plant. Approximately 8,300 linear feet of new pipeline would
be installed. The new pipeline would be located in the 100-year floodplain of White Oak Creek only where the pipeline
crosses White Oak Creek and an unnamed tributary feeding the creek from the west. At these crossings, the pipeline
would be placed on the existing causeways and adjacent to the roadway. After installation, the area would be returned
to the original condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the main facilities of ORNL were built along White Oak Creek, some upgrade projects naturally fall within the
floodplain. This is the case with the new sewer line in the East Area. The only practical route lies between White Oak
Creek and Southside Avenue, an area within the floodplain. The creek also separates the main complex from the outlying
areas. Thus, the sewer line to the outlying areas must cross over the existing causeways to avoid the installation
of new, separate crossings.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several alternatives were evaluated. A no action alternative was evaluated for both subprojects. Two alternative
routes for the new sewer main in the East Area were examined. An alternative route for the sewer main to the outlying
areas was not evaluated since the only practical route follows the existing creek crossings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed upgrades occurring in the floodplain would not have any long-term effects upon the floodplain or surrounding
environment. Only during construction could the project potentially affect the floodplain or the aquatic life in
White Oak Creek and the impacts, if any, would be negligible. During construction, sediment could be introduced into
the creek and unnamed tributary. DOE will prepare a sediment control plan identifying the best management practices
to be employed during construction to minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplain. Control measures
would include the use of sediment and erosion control fences to minimize siltation. Procedural measures would include
excavating trenches of the minimum size and performing construction activities during dry periods. Immediately
upon installation of sections of the sewer line, the trench would be backfilled and compacted. The area would then
be graded to the original contour and seeded. The upgrade project would conform to all applicable State and local floodplain
protection standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the Statement of Findings prior to implementing
the proposed action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a floodplain statement of findings for the Fort Morgan North Tapline Project prepared in accordance with 10
CFR part 1022. Western Area Power Administration (Western) proposes to construct 3 miles of new 115-kilovolt (kV)
tapline in Morgan County, Colorado. The tapline would connect Western's existing Beaver Creek-Weld 115-kV transmission
line with Morgan County Rural Electric Association's (MCREA) new Fort Morgan North Substation. The Fort Morgan North
Tapline would cross the floodplain of the South Platte River in Morgan County, Colorado. Western prepared a floodplain
and wetlands assessment describing the effects, alternatives, and measures designed to avoid or minimize potential
harm to or within the affected floodplain. This action is categorically excluded under the DOE's National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) Implementing Procedures (10 CFR part 1021). Western will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review
after publication of the statement of findings before implementing the proposed action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a floodplain statement of findings for the Fort Morgan North 115-kV Tapline Project prepared in accordance
with 10 CFR part 1022. A notice of floodplain and wetlands involvement was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (FR) on October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51623). Western is proposing to construct 3 miles of 115&hyph;kV tapline between Western's
existing Beaver Creek-Weld 115-kV transmission line and MCREA's proposed new Fort Morgan North Substation. The
tapline would be single circuit and would be constructed on single wood-pole structures. Approximately 13 wood-pole
structures and two span structures (steel H-frame design) would be located within the floodplain of the South Platte
River. Existing access is available along most of the proposed tapline right-of-way. New access trails may be required
to access span structures located on either side of the river crossing. No construction would occur within the river.
The tapline would span the active channel of the South Platte River. Approximately 600 square feet of riparian woodland
would be removed on either side of the river for the construction of the two span structures. This would be a direct long-term
impact. About 0.8 acre would be maintained as riparian shrubland as a result of project maintenance and would also
be a direct long-term impact. Approximately 2 acres would be temporarily affected during construction for equipment
and construction material staging and would be a minor short-term impact. No watercourses or drainage patterns would
be altered by the project. Flood storage volume would not be affected. The action would conform with applicable State
or local floodplain protection standards. This action is categorically excluded under the DOE's NEPA Implementing
Procedures (10 CFR part 1021).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;417) and the Generic Animal Drug
and Patent Term Restoration Act (Pub. L. 100&hyph;670) generally provide that a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years so long as the patented item (human drug product, animal drug product, medical device, food additive,
or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under these acts, a product's
regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time: a testing phase and an approval phase. For human drug products,
the testing phase begins when the exemption to permit the clinical investigations of the drug becomes effective and
runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market
the human drug product and continues until FDA grants permission to market the drug product. Although only a portion
of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and
Trademarks may award (for example, half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred
before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a human drug product
will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 156(g)(1)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recently approved for marketing the human biologic product Betaseron
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is indicated for use in ambulatory patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis to reduce the frequency
of clinical exacerbations. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration
application for Betaseron
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (U.S. Patent No. 4,588,585) from the Cetus Oncology Corp., and the Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance
in determining the patent's eligibility for patent term restoration. In a letter dated October 26, 1993, FDA advised
the Patent and Trademark Office that this human biologic product had undergone a regulatory review period and that
the approval of Betaseron
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the product. Shortly thereafter, the Patent and Trademark
Office requested that FDA determine the product's regulatory review period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Betaseron
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is 3,720 days. Of this time, 3,319 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 401
days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date an exemption under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act became effective
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: May 19, 1983. The applicant claims April 4, 1986, as the date the investigational new drug application (IND) became
effective. However, FDA records indicate that the IND effective date was May 19, 1983, which was 30 days after FDA receipt
of the IND.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was initially submitted with respect to the human drug product under section 351 of the Public
Health Service Act
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: June 18, 1992. The applicant claims June 16, 1992, as the date the product license application (PLA) for Betaseron
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=2 -->
&reg;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (PLA 92&hyph;0495) was initially submitted. However, FDA records indicate that PLA 92&hyph;0495 was initially
submitted on June 18, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The date the application was approved
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: July 23, 1993. FDA has verified the applicant's claim that PLA 92&hyph;0495 was approved on July 23, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension.
However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual
period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 1,500 days of patent term
extension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before March 7, 1994, submit to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested
person may petition FDA, on or before July 5, 1994, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension
acted with due diligence during the regulatory review period. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient
facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, part 1, 98th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 41&hyph;42, 1984.) Petitions
should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA announces the revocation of the establishment license (U.S. License No. 1074&hyph;003) and the product license
issued to AVRE Inc., 10506 Bridgeport Way SW., Tacoma, WA 98499, for the manufacture of Source Plasma. Other locations
under the AVRE license are not affected by this revocation. The licenses were revoked for the Tacoma location of AVRE
only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 FDA inspected the Tacoma location of AVRE on April 7 through 21, 1993. During that inspection, FDA observed numerous
deviations from the standards established in the license as well as the applicable Federal regulations. The inspection
documented serious deviations from the applicable Federal regulations and standards established in the license.
These deviations included, but were not limited to, the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Failure to follow adequate written standard operating procedures (SOP's) for determining donor suitability
(21 CFR 606.100(b)), in that four donors were allowed to donate Source Plasma more than twice during a 7-day period;
five donors were allowed to donate Source Plasma who had experienced a weight loss of greater than 10 pounds within
a 2-month period without first being referred to a physician or physician substitute; and educational information
provided to donors did not reference a temperature greater than 100.5 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=8 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0253 grid5678 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
F for more than 10 days as a symptom of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Failure to follow adequate written SOP's for the collection, processing, storage, and distribution of blood and
blood components for further manufacturing (21 CFR 606.100(b)), in that AVRE collected an amount of plasma from at
least three donors that exceeded the maximum volume allowed by AVRE's plasma volume nomogram, AVRE's donor record
files for at least 20 donors, 6 with multiple donations, did not contain photographs; and AVRE did not have its physician
or physician substitute evaluate one donor who exhibited a temperature below 97.0 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=8 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0253 grid5678 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
F.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Failure to maintain complete, accurate, and concurrent records that clearly traced the steps of each significant
procedure in the collection, processing, and storage of the blood products so as to provide a complete history of work
performed (21 CFR 606.160), in that AVRE was unable to trace two unit numbers to the donors, AVRE misspelled the last
name of at least one donor in the deferral file, and AVRE had no unit number in its donor record file for at least one donation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Failure to observe, standardize, and calibrate equipment (21 CFR 606.60(a)), in that during October 1992, AVRE
failed to clean the air filters on four Autopheresis-C machines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA determined that the nature of the deficiencies found at AVRE showed a pattern of careless disregard for the standards
established in the license and the Federal regulations that are designed to ensure the continued safety, purity,
and potency of the manufactured product and that willfulness existed. The recent inspection showed that corrective
actions promised in response to a March through April 1992 inspection, which resulted in suspension of AVRE's license,
were not implemented or were not effective in achieving long-term compliance. In a letter to AVRE dated May 27, 1993,
FDA delineated the observations listed above, provided notice that FDA intended to institute proceedings to revoke
U.S. License 1074&hyph;003 issued to AVRE pursuant to 21 CFR 601.5(b). In accordance with 21 CFR 601.5(b), the letter
advised AVRE that no additional time would be provided to achieve compliance with the regulations before FDA would
institute proceedings to revoke the licenses of AVRE. The letter further announced its intent to offer an opportunity
for a hearing. In a letter to FDA dated June 30, 1993, AVRE voluntarily requested that its licenses for the Tacoma location
be revoked and thereby waived its opportunity for a hearing. In a letter dated November 8, 1993, FDA acknowledged voluntary
revocation of the establishment license (U.S. License No. 1074&hyph;003) and the aforementioned product license
of AVRE at the Tacoma location only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has placed copies of letters relevant to the license revocations on file under the docket number found in brackets
in the heading of this document in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm.
1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857. These documents are available for public examination in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, under 21 CFR 601.5 and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262), and under authority
delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Director, Center for Biologics

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the filing notice for a food additive petition filed by Milliken
Chemical to indicate that the petitioned additive, dimethyldibenzylidene sorbitol, is also intended for use in
high-propylene olefin copolymers for use in contact with food. The previous filing notice stated that the additive
was intended for use only in polypropylene articles intended for use in contact with food.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 22, 1993 (58 FR 21583), FDA announced that a petition (FAP 2B4341) had been filed on behalf of Milliken Chemical,
c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite 500 West, Washington, DC 20001, proposing that the food additive regulations in &sect;178.3295

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Clarifying agents for polymers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 178.3295) be amended to provide for the safe use of dimethyldibenzylidene sorbitol as a clarifying agent for
polypropylene articles intended for use in contact with food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon further review of the petition, the agency notes that the petitioner had requested use of the additive as a clarifying
agent in high-propylene olefin copolymers in addition to its use in polypropylene films. Therefore, FDA is amending
the filing notice of April 22, 1993, to state that the petitioner requested that the food additive regulations be amended
to provide for the safe use of dimethyldibenzylidene sorbitol as a clarifying agent in polypropylene and high-propylene
olefin copolymers for use in contact with food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of the notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. FDA will also place on public display any
amendments to, or comments on, the petitioner's environmental assessment without further announcement in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Interested persons may, on or before February 3, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written
comments regarding this notice. Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit
one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received
comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. If, based on its review, the
agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the
notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and evidence supporting that finding will
be published with the final regulation in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Drug and device-induced diseases are serious health problems. It is estimated that 2 to 10 percent of all hospitalizations
are a result of serious adverse events. The purpose of this conference is to develop recommendations on ways to heighten
health professionals' awareness of the extent and spectrum of drug and device-induced disease and to break down barriers
to the discovery and reporting of important adverse events to FDA and manufacturers by: (1) Strengthening undergraduate
curricula, (2) enhancing postgraduate training, and (3) building user-friendly reporting mechanisms for health
professionals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
David A. Kessler, Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and James S. Todd, Executive Vice President of the AMA, will be the
keynote speakers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conference should be of interest to the following groups: Practicing health professionals, health professional
organizations, health professions educators (undergraduate and graduate), health professionals of State health
departments, regulatory and safety surveillance professionals, and hospital personnel (e.g, risk managers/quality
assurance personnel and members of Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is a participatory conference. Recommendations from the breakout sessions will be presented on the second day

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice announces the Medicare program's proposal to revise its national policy by withdrawing coverage for
diagnostic nocturnal penile tumescence (NPT) testing in the sleep disorder clinic. For all other settings, we are
proposing to exclude rather than withdraw coverage because the Medicare program does not have a national policy that
provides for coverage of NPT testing by plethysmography and other monitoring devices in settings other than sleep
disorder clinics. Public Health Service studies show that NPT testing is not a reliable index for evaluating impotence.
Therefore, it does not meet HCFA's criteria for effectiveness.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Administration of the Medicare program is governed by the Medicare statute, title XVIII of the Social Security Act
(the Act). The Congress intended, at the time Medicare was enacted in 1965, that Medicare provide health insurance
to protect the elderly (and later, the disabled) from the substantial costs of health care services. The Medicare
law provides coverage for broad categories of benefits, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care, skilled
nursing facility (SNF) care, home health care, and physicians' services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Medicare program consists of two separate but complementary health insurance programs, a Hospital Insurance
(HI) program (known as Part A) and a Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) program (known as Part B). Although Part
A is called Hospital Insurance, covered benefits also include medical services furnished in SNFs or by home health
agencies (HHAs) and hospices. For purposes of the Medicare program, we refer to these entities as ``providers.''
These providers must be certified as qualified providers of services and must sign an agreement to participate in
the program. Part B covers a wide range of medical services and supplies such as those furnished by physicians, providers,
or others in connection with physicians' services, outpatient hospital services, outpatient physical therapy
and occupational therapy services, and home health services. Physicians' services covered under Part B include
visits to patients in the home, office, hospital, and other institutions. Part B also covers certain drugs and biologicals,
diagnostic x-ray and laboratory tests, purchase or rental of durable medical equipment (DME), ambulance services,
prosthetic devices, and certain medical supplies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Medicare law provides coverage for the broad categories of benefits described above, it also places categorical
limitations on the coverage of the services furnished by certain health care practitioners, such as dentists, chiropractors,
and podiatrists, and it specifically excludes some categories of services from coverage, such as cosmetic surgery,
personal comfort items, custodial care, and routine physical checkups. The statute also provides direction as to
the manner in which payment is made for Medicare services, the rules governing eligibility for services, and the health,
safety, and quality standards to be met by providers and some types of suppliers that furnish services to Medicare
beneficiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Medicare law does not, however, provide an all-inclusive list of specific items, services, treatments, procedures,
or technologies covered by Medicare. Thus, except for the examples of DME in section 1861(n) of the Act, some of the
medical and other health services listed in section 1861(s) of the Act, and exclusions from coverage listed in section
1862(a) of the Act, the statute does not specify medical devices, surgical procedures, or diagnostic and therapeutic
services that should be covered or excluded from coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Congress understood that questions about coverage for specific services would arise and would require us to make
specific decisions about coverage. Thus, it gave the Secretary the authority to make those decisions. Section 1862(a)(1)(A)
of the Act prohibits payment for items or services that ``are not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment
of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have interpreted this statutory provision to exclude from Medicare coverage those medical and other health care
services that are not demonstrated to be safe or effective. Effectiveness in this context is the probability of benefit
to individuals from a medical item, service, or procedure for a given medical problem under average conditions of
use; that is, day-to-day medical practice. In day-to-day medical practice, physicians diagnose and treat clinical
conditions following inquiry into an individual's medical history, performance of a physical examination, and
interpretations of a variety of diagnostic tests and procedures. To be of value to the physician, the information
obtained from any diagnostic test or procedure must be sufficiently accurate to provide a reasonably reliable measure
for establishing or ruling out the presence of a given disease. Payment may not be made under Medicare for any diagnostic
test or procedure that does not produce accurate results when properly performed, since that test cannot be considered
``reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury.''

B. Medicare Coverage of Diagnostic Nocturnal Penile Tumescence Testing (Testing for Impotence) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Impotence is the inability to attain and maintain an erection sufficient to permit satisfactory intercourse and
is considered by Medicare to be the failure of a body part when the diagnosis, and frequently the treatment, require
medical expertise. Impotence can be organic or psychogenic in origin. The focus of diagnostic tests is to determine
the origin of impotence to establish the appropriate treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, Medicare covers diagnostic NPT testing by plethysmography (for example, mercury strain gauges) and
other monitoring devices in a sleep disorder clinic to determine whether erectile impotence is organic or psychogenic.
Although impotence is not a sleep disorder, the nature of the testing requires that it be performed while the patient
sleeps. In the past, it was believed that patients with predominantly psychogenic impotence would regularly attain
normal erections during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, while patients with organic impotence would not demonstrate
significant sleep-associated normal erections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During NPT testing, mercury strain gauges placed on the shaft of the penis can detect and measure changes in penile
circumference during sleep. A normal result of NPT, measured with strain gauges, is two or more periods of sustained
erections lasting more than 20 minutes and associated with at least a 25-mm increase in penile circumference. Normal
NPT in a person with sexual dysfunction implies intact neurovascular structures and suggests psychogenic impotence.
An abnormal recording, however, is not definitive and only suggests organic impotence and will require further testing
for a more definite diagnosis. In addition, NPT testing has a high incidence (15 to 20 percent) of false-positive and,
although not as common, false-negative findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, diagnostic NPT testing in a sleep disorder clinic is listed as covered under ``Sleep Disorder Clinics''
in section 3112.5 of the Medicare Intermediary Manual (HCFA Pub. 13&hyph;3) and section 2055 of the Medicare Carriers
Manual (HCFA Pub. 14&hyph;3), under limited circumstances, for example, to confirm appropriate treatment and for
a maximum of 2 nights of testing. Section 35&hyph;24, ``Diagnosis and Treatment of Impotence,'' of the Medicare Coverage
Issues Manual (HCFA Pub. 6), does not address the use of plethysmography, a non-specific test for vascular competence,
which may include monitoring devices, rigidometers, strain gauges, and stamp tests. However, we are revising this
manual section to state that plethysmography is noncovered for use in the diagnosis of impotence because it does not
indicate the rigidity and the duration of tumescence, both of which are necessary components in the evaluation of
impotence. (Before publication, RS will confirm the status of this manual instruction.)

 C. Recommendations to Withdraw Coverage for Diagnostic Nocturnal Penile Tumescence Testing in a Sleep Disorder
Clinic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1986, a Medicare contractor requested advice about paying for items and services related to impotence testing.
Medicare coverage instructions on the diagnosis and treatment of impotence did not specifically address the issues
of plethysmography and in-home impotence testing devices. At that time, two monitoring devices had been developed
for in-home testing under a physician's direction: the Snap-gauge, which measures the tumescence of the penis during
sleep, and Rigiscan, which measures the duration and frequency of erections as well as the degree of rigidity and tumescence
during sleep. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, we consulted the HCFA Physicians Panel, a group of staff physicians and other health professionals in
HCFA's central office and their counterparts in the Public Health Service (PHS). They advised us to ask PHS, through
the Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA), to assess the safety and effectiveness of the principal diagnostic
tests for impotence currently in use. (Our current process for making coverage decisions is discussed in the January
30, 1989, proposed rule entitled ``Medicare Program Criteria and Procedures for Making Medical Services Coverage
Decisions that Relate to Health Care Technology'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(54 FR 4305)).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In September 1986, we asked OHTA to conduct a full assessment of the safety and effectiveness of diagnostic tests for
impotence and the methods for treating impotence. To conduct this assessment, OHTA solicited information from manufacturers,
researchers, other government agencies, other components of PHS, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). OHTA
also evaluated the latest scientific studies, medical literature, information from medical specialty groups,
and respondents to the March 19, 1987, notice entitled ``National Center for Health Services Research and Health
Care Technology Assessment; Assessment of Medical Technology'' (54 FR 8648). In that notice, OHTA announced that
it was assessing the safety and effectiveness of diagnostic tests and treatment methods for impotence. OHTA researched
and analyzed published medical and scientific literature and relevant studies and reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time we received the OHTA assessment on the diagnosis and treatment for impotence dated October 31, 1989, we
asked for an assessment on sleep disorders. (Since December 1989, OHTA has been a part of PHS' Agency for Health Care
Policy and Research.) The OHTA assessment, ``Sleep Disorders,'' dated February 3, 1992, did not raise issues that
would result in further coverage changes. Although OHTA's assessment on the diagnosis and treatment of impotence
was issued 3 years ago, we have determined that the medical evidence and conclusions of the assessment are still accurate
based on our own medical expertise and a thorough review of all the medical literature on the subject since 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OHTA assessment, ``Public Health Service Assessment_The Diagnosis and Treatment of Impotence'' includes a
bibliography of studies evaluating the effectiveness of various types of impotence testing and treatment. (Copies
of this assessment may be obtained from the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Publications Clearinghouse,
P.O. Box 8547, Silver Spring, MD 20907; Toll Free: 1&hyph;800&hyph;358&hyph;9295.) In the assessment, OHTA concluded
that reliable tests for evaluating impotence include Doppler ultrasound, arteriography, cavernosography, cavernosometry,
hormonal assays, and electrophysiological testing. NPT testing by plethysmography and other monitoring devices
in the clinical setting or in the home is determined to be unreliable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to OHTA, there are no accepted standards for NPT test results. Results cannot be compared among laboratories
because each laboratory has its own set of standards by which to evaluate NPT. False-positive and false-negative
results occur frequently indicating that NPT testing is not a reliable index for differentiating organic from psychogenic
impotence, thereby making it impossible to choose the appropriate treatment. Also, OHTA does not consider other
in-home monitoring devices to be reliable for diagnosing impotence.

II. Provisions of This Proposed Notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Based on the conclusion of the OHTA technology assessment that scientific evidence indicates that NPT testing is
not a reliable index for evaluating impotence, we have concluded that NPT testing does not meet our criteria for effectiveness.
Therefore, we propose to revise our national policy by withdrawing coverage for NPT testing in the sleep disorder
clinic. We do not have a national policy regarding NPT testing in other settings. Therefore, we propose to exclude
coverage for NPT testing, rather than withdraw coverage, in all other settings. Because NPT test results are not standardized
and are frequently inaccurate and have a high rate of false-positive and false-negative results, the appropriate
treatment cannot be determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The provisions of this notice would not affect existing Medicare regulations. However, they would affect the following

A. Executive Order 12291
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Executive Order 12291 (E.O. 12291) requires us to prepare and publish a regulatory impact analysis for any notice
that meets one of the E.O. 12291 criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to result in_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government
agencies, or geographic regions; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the
ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We propose to revise our national policy and to withdraw Medicare program coverage for NPT testing in the sleep disorder
clinic. Because we do not have a national policy regarding NPT testing in other settings, we propose to exclude coverage,
rather than withdraw coverage, for NPT testing by plethysmography and other monitoring devices in all other settings.
In calendar year 1992, Medicare payment for NPT testing totaled approximately $840,000 for 13,000 allowed services.
This is an increase of approximately 26 percent in expenditures and a 3 percent increase in the number of services over
the previous year. We anticipate that future costs or savings as a result of this notice would be negligible. This notice
would not meet the $100 million criterion nor would it meet the other E.O. 12291 criteria. Therefore, this notice is
not a major rule under E.O. 12291, and an initial regulatory impact analysis is not required.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a notice would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all physicians, sleep disorder clinics, and manufacturers
of devices for performing the NPT test are considered to be small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a notice
may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must
conform to the provisions of section 603 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural
hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Currently, Medicare covers diagnostic NPT testing. Although impotence is not a sleep disorder, the nature of the
testing requires that it be performed while a patient sleeps. As discussed in detail in section I.C. of this notice,
the OHTA technology assessment has concluded that NPT testing in the sleep disorder clinic is not a reliable index
for evaluating impotence. False-positive and false-negative results occur frequently indicating that NPT testing
is not a reliable indicator for choosing the appropriate treatment. Based on scientific evidence that indicates
that NPT testing is not a reliable index for evaluating impotence, we have concluded that NPT testing does not meet
our criteria for effectiveness, a primary requirement for Medicare program coverage. We believe the test has not
been performed often by medical practitioners because of the test's limited value. Therefore, we propose to withdraw
Medicare coverage of NPT testing in the sleep disorder clinic and exclude coverage of NPT testing by plethysmography
and other monitoring devices in all other settings. Our decision to withdraw coverage should have only a minimal effect
on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined,
and the Secretary certifies, that this notice would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities and would not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.

Description of the Need for the Information and its Proposed Use: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Program is authorized by Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993. The statute requires the Secretaries of HUD and Agriculture to make designations of empowerment zones
and enterprise communities from among eligible areas based on a Strategic Plan which addresses the human, physical,
economic and community development problems in the area. HUD has prepared an application form HUD&hyph;40003 to
allow applicants to apply for designation. We are asking the OMB for expedited clearance of the application form to
allow the maximum time possible for eligible applications to prepare their applications.

Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Program Attachment to SF 83_Supporting Statement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Justification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The statute requires that data demonstrating eligibility must be submitted as part of the nomination for Empowerment
Zone/Enterprise Community designation, as well as the Strategic Plan addressing problems in the nominated area
which will serve as the basis for designation by the appropriate Secretary. In addition the statute requires that
the nomination for designation include benchmarks established by the nominee for measuring the success of the nominees
plan implementation. Modification of the boundaries of the zone or lack of progress in achieving the benchmarks set
forth in the strategic plan is indicated in the statute as grounds for a revokation by the appropriate Secretary of
the designation. Therefore, we will ask for periodic (annual) reports from the designated Empowerment Zones and
Enterprise Communities in which they indicate how they are progressing against the benchmarks they established.
We do not have a specific form which must be used to make this report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Nomination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Eligibility factors include documentation of specific levels of poverty by census tract, pervasive poverty
and general distress. In addition, parameters of geographic size and population are included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The statute provides that in making designations, the Secretary will consider the effectiveness of the strategic
plan, the effectiveness of the assurances provided and the other criteria which may be specified by the appropriate
Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Periodic (annual) performance reports. As indicated above this report will be submitted by the designated Empowerment
Zones and Enterprise Communities to show their progress in achieving the benchmarks set forth in their strategic
plans. The appropriate Secretary will use the information submitted to evaluate the success of the Empowerment Zones
and Enterprise Communities as indicated in the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Purpose and use of the information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nominations will be used by HUD and USDA to evaluate the eligibility of the nominated areas and make designations
of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in accordance with the designation criteria set forth in the statute.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The period reports will be used as required by the statute to determine the success of each designee in meeting its established
benchmarks and in evaluating the program as a whole.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Use of information technology to reduce burden_not applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Effort to identify duplication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These requirements are the minimum necessary to meet the requirements of the statute and put the Program into effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Availability of similar information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While available information can be used to prepare the nomination and develop the strategic plan, the statute requires
that the nominee develop this information for an area it selects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Small business involvement_not applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Consequence of less frequent information collection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We judge periodic reports to be the minimum needed to administer the program in conformance with the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Inconsistency with 5 CFR 1320.6_not applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Persons consulted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

In accordance with 43 CFR 1601.3, notice is hereby given that the Bureau of Land Management in the State of Oregon, Prineville
District, intends to amend that portion of the John Day Resource Management Plan (RMP) within the Prineville District.
The existing RMP was approved in August 1985 and provides management direction and resource allocations for all BLM-managed
lands in Grant County located in central and northeastern Oregon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment is to specifically identify public lands in the Central Oregon Resource Area located in Grant County
for retention or disposal and to identify, generally, private land that may be suitable for acquisition through exchange,
purchase or donation. All acquisitions will be on a ``willing buyer_willing seller'' basis. Presently, there are
over 180,000 acres of public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management in Grant County, which contains a total of
approximately 3,000,000 acres of land. While the John Day RMP does identify public land suitable for sale, it does
not specifically identify public lands suitable for exchange or other realty actions. It also does not identify which
of the BLM-managed public lands should be retained for multiple use or what privately-owned lands may be suitable
for acquisition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, this notice serves as the Notice of Realty Action as required by 43 CFR part 2200. The Prineville District
is considering five exchange proposals affecting 8,340 acres of public land described as follows:

Tracts to be acquired have not yet been identified, but the proponent has offered to purchase land along the North or
South Forks of the John Day River.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appraisals for these exchanges have not yet been completed. Therefore, the amount of land traded may be different
than that shown after values are equalized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the exchanges are to acquire and block up lands in Grant County, particularly along the forks of the John
Day River. These lands have high public value for riparian, fisheries, wildlife, recreation and scenic quality.
Acquisition of this land would be consistent with the Bureau's planning system after the plan is amended. The value
of the lands has not been determined; however, upon completion of the final appraisal, the acreage will be adjusted
or money will be used to equalize values. The public lands will be transferred subject to: (1) A reservation to the United
States of a rights-of-way for ditches or canals constructed by the authority of the United States, Act of Aug. 30, 1890
(43 U.S.C. 945); (2) All valid existing rights-of-way, leases, permits or licenses in effect at the time of exchange.
The mineral estate is expected to be included in the exchange.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Leptonycteris curasoae yerbabuenae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) which the Service listed as an endangered species in 1988 (FR 38460; September 30, 1988). The lesser long-nosed bat
occurs in southern Arizona, southwest New Mexico and the western and southern portions of Mexico. This species is
migratory and is found in the United States during the summer. The Service solicits review and comment from the public
on this draft plan.

Restoring an endangered or threatened plant or animal to the point where it is again a secure, self-sustaining member
of its ecosystem is a primary goal of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's endangered species program. To help guide
the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United
States. Recovery plans describe the site specific management actions considered necessary for conservation and
survival of the species, establish objectives, and measurable criteria for the recovery levels for downlisting
or delisting species, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service, and other affected Federal
agencies, will take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.

The lesser long-nosed bat occurs in caves and mines in southern Arizona from approximately May through September.
Both maternity colonies and night roosts are found in the state. Wintering areas for bats that summer in the United
States are not defined. Maternity colonies and other types of roosts are found in western and southern Mexico. Management
issues and concerns include mining activities, disturbance of foraging areas, animal control actions, and human
disturbance of roost sites.

The lesser long-nosed bat recovery plan has been reviewed by the appropriate Service staff in Region 2 and was developed

 In No. 32133, Union Pacific Corporation, and its subsidiary railroads Union Pacific Railroad and Missouri Pacific

(1) Access by such trackage and haulage rights as would be most efficient in the circumstances to provide full service
to all shippers served by CNW and its existing affiliates (except those in Michigan and northeast Wisconsin). SP may
hold out service in its own name, and quote rates and contracts without the concurrence of CNW; CNW shall furnish the
underlying rail transportation as an independent contractor for mutually agreed upon compensation (or Commission
prescribed compensation in the event of a failure to agree); and CNW shall give such traffic equal handling and priority
as its own traffic; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Access by such trackage and haulage rights as would be most efficient in the circumstances (a) to serve origins
and destinations exclusively served by UP via Missouri Pacific Railroad (MP) and former Missouri-Kansas-Texas
Railroad lines (MKT); and (b) to bridge between the CNW in the North and the SP in the South. SP may hold out service in
its own name, and quote rates and contracts without the concurrence of CNW; MP shall furnish the underlying rail transportation
as an independent contractor for mutually agreed upon compensation (or Commission prescribed compensation in the
event of a failure to agree); and MP shall give such traffic equal handling and priority as its own traffic; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Such changes in compensation, ownership and responsibility for maintenance, dispatch and other operations,
and terminal rights and access to certain intermediate points, as will permit efficient and effective competition
by SP utilizing the trackage rights granted in Finance Docket No. 30,000: (a) to SSW between Kansas City, MO, and East
St. Louis, IL; and (b) to DRGW between Pueblo, CO, and Kansas City. Such changes include various measures to insure
that SP trains are to be given equal treatment with UP trains; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Provisions designed to provide access to CNW facilities at the Chicago Switching District that will allow SP to
provide service and competition on terms and conditions no less favorable than those available to UP today, including
reciprocal switching; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Access to and participation in each of the marketing and operational coordinations of the type described at pages
372&hyph;376 of Volume 1 of the Application, which are entered into by UP and CNW with each other subsequent to the effective
date of any control authority granted in this proceeding, on terms and conditions that are substantially equivalent
to the terms and conditions of UP's access or participation.

Although SP's application includes pro forma financial information for the first year of consummation of the transaction,
it has failed to submit pro forma statements covering subsequent reporting period requirements under the Commission's
consolidation procedures, 49 CFR 1180.9. Given the nature of the conditions that SP is requesting, the financial
information omitted would appear to be of very limited relevance, at best, and unnecessary to a decision. Moreover,
our regulations will change as of December 30, 1993, and the application would qualify as complete if it had been filed
after that date. See

These applications are consolidated for disposition with the primary application in Finance Docket No. 32133. Service
of an initial decision will be waived, and determination of the merits of the applications will be made in the first
instance by the entire Commission. 49 U.S.C. 11345(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may participate formally by submitting written comments regarding all or any of the responsive
applications. Comments should indicate the exact proceeding designation, and should be filed with the correct number
of copies and with the Commission offices specified above no later than February 28, 1994. Comments shall include
the following: The person's position in support of or in opposition to the proposed transaction; any and all evidence,
including verified statements, in support of or in opposition to the proposed transaction; and specific reasons
why approval would or would not be in the public interest. See 49 CFR 1180.4(d)(1). Interested persons who do not intend
to participate formally in the proceeding but who desire to comment may file statements, subject to the filing and
service requirements specified below. Persons must state specifically whether they intend actively to participate
in the proceeding or whether they wish only to be advised of all decisions issued by the Commission. Failure to state
an intention to participate as an active party will result in the person being placed in the latter category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments must be concurrently served by first class mail on the Secretary of the Department of Transportation,
on the Attorney General of the United States, and on all other persons designated as active parties of record on the
Commission's service list, including primary applicants' representatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rebuttal in support of these responsive applications must be filed by March 19, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because these applications contain proposed conditions to approval of the application in Finance Docket No. 32133,
the Commission will entertain no requests for affirmative relief related to these proposals. Parties may only participate
in direct support of or direct opposition to these applications as filed.

Civil Action No. 91&hyph;771&hyph;AS was lodged on December 17, 1993, with the United States District Court for the
District of Oregon. The Consent Decree settles all claims with the two defendants, Environmental Pacific Corporation
(EPC) and Richard Hill.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original complaint in this action was brought against EPC pursuant to Section 3008(h) of the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6928(h), seeking an order that EPC perform corrective action at its facility in
Amity, Oregon to clean up hazardous constituents that had been released into the environment. EPC operated a hazardous
waste treatment, storage or disposal facility in Amity, where EPC handled primarily spent batteries, electroplating
wastewater treatment sludge, and other allegedly recyclable materials containing plastics and metals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an amended complaint, the United States added claims against EPC and Richard Hill, the President of EPC while the
company was in operation, pursuant to 40 CFR 268.50 for improper storage of F006 electroplating wastes and mercury,
which are wastes restricted from land disposal under RCRA. The amended complaint also included a claim against Richard
Hill under section 104(e) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed partial consent decree concerns alleged violations of sections 301 and 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33
U.S.C. 1311, 1344, as a result of the unpermitted construction of a dam in Caney Creek and a recreation area in wetlands
by the defendants at the Windward development in Alpharetta, Georgia. Under the partial consent decree, the defendants
will pay a $100,000 civil penalty to the U.S. Treasury, and will provide up to $225,000 in funding for projects to improve
and protect wetlands and water quality in the same watershed where the alleged violations occurred. If entered by
the Court, the proposed partial consent decree, in conjunction with the previously entered partial consent decree,
will fully resolve this litigation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act, (21 U.S.C. 826), requires the Attorney General to establish aggregate
production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II each year. This responsibility has been delegated
to the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration pursuant to &sect;0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal
Regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 1, 1993, an interim rule establishing revised 1993 aggregate production quotas for controlled substances
in Schedules I and II was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(58 FR 51382). One comment was received from a company supporting the use of the interim rule in establishing aggregate
production quotas under certain circumstances. The interim rule is adopted without change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and
Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These actions have been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose interests
must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The establishment of annual aggregate
production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law and by international commitments
of the United States. Such quotas impact predominantly upon major manufacturers of the affected controlled substance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by section 306 of the CSA of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 826) and delegated
to the Administrator by &sect;0.100 of title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the Administrator of the DEA hereby
establishes the following revised 1993 aggregate production quotas for the listed controlled substances, expressed
in grams of anhydrous base:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Virginia Electric and Power Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;4 and
NPF&hyph;7 which authorize operation of North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and No. 2 (NA&hyph;1&amp;2, the facility)
at steady-state power levels not in excess of 2893 megawatts thermal. The licenses provide, among other things, that
the facility is subject to all the rules, regulations, and orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission)
now or hereafter in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility employs pressurized water reactors (PWRs) located at the licensee's site in Louisa County, Virginia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee is implementing a refurbishment and restoration program for the NA&hyph;1&amp;2 service water system
(SWS). The program is being conducted in several stages. The subject Phase 1, Stage 4 is to be conducted for a period
of time beginning January 3, 1994 and ending October 13, 1994, and will be performed during dual unit operating conditions.
The scope of Stage 4 involves restoration of the two 24-inch auxiliary supply lines from Lake Anna to the main SW headers.
This consists of approximately 900 linear feet of piping (450 feet per line). Each 450-foot line consists of approximately
185 feet of direct buried piping, 230 feet of concrete-encased piping and 35 feet of exposed piping. To support the
Phase 1, Stage 4 SWS restoration program, the licensee has identified one temporary exemption required at this time.
The exemption is specified below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 -->
II
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Code of Federal Regulations at 10 CFR part 50, Appendix A, General Design Criterion-2 (GDC&hyph;2) requires that:
Structures, systems, and components important to safety shall be designed to withstand the effects of natural phenomena
such as *&blank;*&blank;* tornadoes, *&blank;*&blank;* without loss of capability to perform their safety functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee has requested the temporary exemption from GDC&hyph;2 because of planned maintenance which will expose
portions of the SWS piping to the potential effects of postulated missiles generated by natural phenomena. Earth
and concrete protect the piping systems from the effects of severe weather events at the NA&hyph;1&amp;2 site, such
as tornadoes, for conformance with the requirements of GDC&hyph;2. The excavation of the auxiliary service water
lines will affect only the missile shield protection aspects of GDC&hyph;2, with seismic qualification being retained.
While producing a minimal increase in missile interaction risk, excavation of the piping does not result in total
vulnerability to missiles. In the area of the planned excavation, the lines are substantially below grade and are
adjacent to the turbine building structure. This will prevent some lateral aspects of missile vulnerability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee is providing contingency measures with compensatory actions to provide added assurance of safe operation
of the facility during the exemption period. Although the exemption is requested only for missile protection, the
risk to the plant due to construction mishaps is more significant than the risk due to natural phenomena. Therefore,
the compensatory measures are geared toward preventing such mishaps in addition to minimizing the potential for
missiles generated by severe weather. As stated in the staff's Safety Evaluation dated December 27, 1993, these compensatory
actions include but are not limited to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Electronic scanning and nondestructive locating methods will be used to accurately determine underground
locations of piping, duct banks, and other buried utilities prior to excavation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Machine excavation will be limited to an elevation that does not pose a threat to the auxiliary service water
(ASW) lines. The remaining excavation will be performed by hand operated power and manual tools.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Physical barriers will be used to keep vehicles a safe distance from the excavation site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Loose materials in and around the excavation will be limited to only those absolutely necessary for activities
in progress.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Lifting and rigging components will be inspected and load tested. Lifting of equipment or construction materials
over the excavation will be performed with adequate precautions in accordance with approved procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Direct verbal communication (using dedicated radios if necessary) will be maintained between equipment
operators and supervisors/observers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Operable ASW lines will retain their seismic qualification.

Engineering reviews will be performed for shoring and temporary supports (if required) in the excavation area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gasoline powered equipment will be refilled using small containers and the number of containers within the excavation
area will be restricted. This is in accordance with the existing station procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Considering the existing design features and compensatory measures proposed by the licensee, the likelihood of
damage to the exposed auxiliary SWS lines from postulated missiles generated by natural phenomena is minimal. Also,
based on the compensatory measures provided, assurance exists that the ability to bring the plant to a safe shutdown
will be maintained following any natural phenomena, including tornadoes or other severe weather which could result
in airborne missiles. Therefore, there is reasonable assurance that the proposed GDC&hyph;2 exemption will present
no undue risk to public health and safety.

The Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a), that special circumstances as set forth in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v).
The exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation (GDC&hyph;2). The exemption is
requested for a specific time period after which the facility would again be in conformance with all the requirements
of GDC&hyph;2. The licensee has made good faith efforts in considering alternatives to the exemption requests and
has concluded that the Phase 1, Stage 4 SWS refurbishment and restoration program can only be conducted without the
subject exemption during a period when both NA&hyph;1&amp;2 are shut down and defueled. The impact of scheduling
such a dual-unit outage would have significant consequences in terms of power supply, fuel storage, capacity, and
replacement power costs. Finally, the exemption will indirectly result in benefits to the public from increased
reliability of the upgraded safety-related SWS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above and on review of the licensee's submittal, as summarized in the Safety Evaluation dated December
27, 1993, the NRC staff concludes that the likelihood of unacceptable damage to the exposed auxiliary SW lines due
to tornadoe-borne missiles during the exemption period is low. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the low probability of unacceptable events, coupled with the comprehensive compensatory measures which
the licensee has committed to, the NRC staff finds the proposed exemption from GEDC&hyph;2 acceptable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the subject exemption is authorized by
law, will not present an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security.
The Commission further determines that special circumstances, as provided in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v), are present
justifying the exemption; namely, that the exemption would provide only temporary relief 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 from the applicable regulations and that the licensee has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Commission hereby approves the following exemption: NA&hyph;1&amp;2 may operate without conforming
to the requirements of GDC&hyph;2 as they apply to the buried portions of the auxiliary SWS lines from Lake Anna to the
main SWS header providing that compensatory measures as described herein are continued for the period of the exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting the above exemption will have no significant
impact on the quality of the human environment (October 7, 1993, 58 FR 52332).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The subject Phase 1, Stage 4 SWS GDC&hyph;2 exemption is effective from its date of issuance through October 14, 1994.

Exchange Rule 5.14(b) outlines the traditional method for the execution of cross transactions on the PSE.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Under that rule, a member effecting a cross transaction must first assure that all existing bids or offers by the specialists,
in the books or at the posts, at or better than the cross price, are filled at their limits.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Thereafter the member must publicly announce both sides of the cross; the member's offer must be higher than his or
her bid by the minimum trading differential permitted for that security.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Rule 5.14(b) then allows the member to execute the cross transaction at his or her bid or offer. Under this method, however,
another member can ``break up'' the cross by trading with either the bid or the offer side of the transaction when it
is presented to the crowd.

In a cross transaction, a member who holds an order to buy and an order to sell an equivalent amount of the same security
wishes to execute the orders against each other. See PSE Rule 5.14(a). Because he or she already holds both sides of
the trade, the member does not want the orders to interact with other market interest.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
the highest bid or the lowest offer) is entitled to priority over bids/offers at inferior prices; similarly, the first
bid/offer clearly established at a given price is entitled to priority over other bids/offers at that same price.

The Exchange proposes to formalize several policies that its Equity Floor Trading Committee previously developed
to encourage the execution of cross transactions on the PSE. Specifically, the proposed commentary to Rule 5.14(b)
will codify the PSE's policy that all efforts should be made to facilitate the execution of crosses; and will clarify
which orders a member must satisfy before he or she can execute such a transaction.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed commentary also will interpret Rule 5.14(b), together with the PSE's priority rule,
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 to prohibit the specialist from participating in a cross to establish or increase his or her position,
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 unless the member effecting the transactions gives the specialist permission to do so.

According to the PSE, this policy initially was established on May 2, 1984. In conjunction with this filing, the Exchange
has clarified that the specialist will be able to participate in a cross transaction in order to decrease his or her
position. See Amendment No. 1, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
supra, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
note 3. Under those circumstances, the specialist's participation will be subject to the additional restrictions
discussed below. See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Exchange proposes to place additional restrictions on when a specialist can break up a cross transaction.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
Thus under the proposed commentary to Rule 5.14(b), the specialist will be prohibited from participating, for the
benefit of his or her own account, on (1) either side of a customer-to-customer cross,
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
or (2) the customer side of a cross with the principal account of a member, where the cross is at a price inside the disseminated
PSE market. The PSE, however, will interpret this provision to allow a specialist who is willing to better the price
to participate in a cross transaction.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
Finally, for purposes of Rule 5.14(b), the Exchange will define a ``customer order'' as an order that a broker represents
in an agency capacity, including a professional order that is not for an account associated with the executing broker.

The PSE believes that the proposed rule change maintains the auction at market principles of price improvement and
priority to existing orders, while at the same facilitating the execution of crosses on the PSE. In addition, the PSE
believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with policies recently adopted by other exchanges.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 The PSE states that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that these changes will
promote just and equitable principles of trade and will protect investors and the public interest by continuing the
effort to remove impediments to a free and open market.

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of sections 6(b) and 11(a).
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
In particular, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirement
that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent
and manipulative acts and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest; and with the section 6(b)(8)
requirement that the rules of an exchange not impose any unnecessary burden on competition. The Commission also believes
that the proposed rule change does not operate in a manner inconsistent with the traditional auction market principle
of customer priority, as embodied in section 11(a) of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful review, the Commission has concluded that the proposed rule change should further competition among
the exchanges, as well as between exchanges and other markets, and should increase the opportunities for the efficient
execution of cross transactions. In the past, the Commission has recognized the competition that exists between
various markets for order flow, and especially for block business. Several exchanges recently have sought Commission
approval to amend their rules, on the grounds that exchange rules may hinder members' ability to execute a cross transaction
without interference and thus may place an exchange at a competitive disadvantage. Despite serious reservations,
the Commission has approved those proposals which are consistent with traditional auction market principles.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to today's competitive market environment, the PSE has proposed to codify its policy that members should
make their best efforts not to interfere in another member's cross transaction and, in particular, that the specialist
should not participate unless he or she is liquidating a position. The PSE also has proposed to add a new requirement,
based on a comparable rule on the Phlx, that the specialist's proprietary bid or offer yield to the customer side of
a cross transaction at the cross price.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Looking at the proposal as whole, the Commission believes that it will clarify the roles of various market participants
and assure that, under routine circumstances, crosses are executed in a fair and orderly manner. In sum, the Commission
finds that this proposed rule change should improve the PSE's ability to compete for block business and should enhance
the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market.

As noted above, this part of the PSE proposal is based on recent amendments to Phlx Rule 126. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
supra, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
note 16. Briefly, the Phlx requires that a member's proprietary bid or offer yield to the customer side of a cross transaction
at the cross price. In approving the Phlx proposal, the Commission took note of the fact that most principal trading
activity on the floor of that regional stock exchange, other than facilitation crosses, is undertaken by the specialist.

The Commission appreciates all the exchanges' competitive concerns with respect to the facilitation of cross transactions
and, at the same time, continues to emphasize the importance of adherence with traditional auction market principles.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In terms of auction market principles, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change strikes an appropriate
balance between the competing needs of various customer orders represented for execution on the PSE and the proprietary
trading operations of Exchange members and member organizations, including specialists. The Commission notes
that Rule 5.14(b) will continue to require that a member effecting a cross transaction first assure that all existing
bids or offers on the specialist's book or represented in the trading crowd, at or better than the cross price, are filled
at their limits.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 On that basis, the Commission has concluded that the PSE proposal adheres to the auction market principles of time
and price priority and that this method for the execution of crosses (and, in particular, the priority granted to the
customer side of the transaction) will not disadvantage existing orders.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 In fact, limit orders on the PSE which coincide with the cross price could benefit from being assured of receiving an
execution at that price.

In this regard, the PSE proposal contrasts favorably with other rule changes approved by the Commission, such as the
NYSE's clean cross proposal, see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
supra 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Furthermore, the Commission finds that the PSE proposal does not restrict the opportunity for customer orders to
receive price improvement. To this end, the Commission interprets the proposed commentary to Rule 5.14(b), and the
Exchange agrees with that interpretation,
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 to allow the specialist to participate in a cross transaction to provide one side with a better price, notwithstanding
the other provisions of this rule.
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, under the PSE's method, it is possible for interest in the trading crowd, including an order for the principal
account of a member, to break up the cross and to improve the price.

Finally, the Commission believes that the PSE proposal would not grant priority, parity or precedence to the order
of a member in a manner inconsistent with section 11(a)(1)(G) of the Act or SEC Rule 11a1&hyph;1(T)(a)(3) thereunder.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 For purposes of its proposed rule change, the PSE has defined the term ``customer order'' as an order that a broker represents
in an agency capacity, including a professional order that is not for an account associated with the executing broker.
Because this definition of ``customer order'' excludes (and, thus, does not grant priority to) an order for an account
over which the broker or an associated person of the broker exercises investment discretion, the Commission is satisfied
that the proposed rule change complies with section 11(a).

The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 merely clarify certain language used in the original
filing and make no substantive changes to the proposed rule. Finally, the Commission did not receive any comments
on the original proposal, which was noticed for the full statutory period.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Continental Homes Holding
Corp., Common Stock, $.01 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;10700</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
December 28, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Continental Homes Holding Corp. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on December 15,
1993 and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its common stock on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market for its common stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before January 20, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

5. On the same day, NBD consented to the entry of a Final Judgment of Permanent Injunction and Other Relief (the ``Final
Judgment''), without admitting or denying any of the allegations in the Commission's complaint except as to jurisdiction.
The Final Judgment enjoins NBD from further violations of Regulation U. The Final Judgment requires that NBD disgorge
$2,500, which represents its gross custodian services fees earned on Sendo's accounts. In addition, the Final Judgment
requires NBD to pay a civil money penalty of $100,000. The Final Judgment also requires NBD to adopt internal procedures
designed to prevent a recurrence of the violative conduct.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants have been advised by the trustees of the Funds and by Washington National that (a) the trustees of the
Funds and the directors of Washington National have reviewed the circumstances pertinent to the Final Judgment,
and, in the case of the Funds, have considered the prior services rendered to the Funds by NBD; and (b) after review and
consideration of such factors as they deemed appropriate, a majority of the trustees of the Woodward Funds who are
not interested persons with respect to applicants, a majority of the trustees of Renaissance Assets Trust who are
not interested persons with respect to applicants, and the directors of Washington National have determined that
the retention of NBD in the case of the Funds and of NBD Bank in the case of Washington National as investment adviser
is in the best interests of the Funds' shareholders and the account holders of the Separate Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In making the application, applicants acknowledge, understand, and agree that the application and any temporary
exemption issued by the Commission shall be without prejudice to the Commission's consideration of any application
for exemptions from statutory requirements, including the consideration of the instant application for a permanent
exemption pursuant to section 9(c) or the revocation or removal of any temporary exemption granted in connection
with the application.

2. Section 9(a) of the Act, in pertinent part, disqualifies any person or company from serving or acting in the capacity
of employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser, or depositor of any registered
investment company, or principal underwriter for any registered open-end company, registered unit investment
trust, or registered face amount certificate company if such person, or an affiliated person of such person, has,
by reason of misconduct, been permanently or temporarily enjoined by an order, judgment, or decree from any court
of competent jurisdiction from acting as an underwriter, broker, dealer, or investment adviser, or from engaging
in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with any such activity or in connection with the purchase or
sale of any security.3. Section 9(c) provides that the Commission shall grant an application for an exemption from
the disqualification provisions of section 9(a), either unconditionally or on an appropriate temporary or other
conditional basis, if it is established that these provisions, as applied to the applicant, are unduly or disproportionately
severe or that the conduct of the applicant has been such as not to make it against the public interest or protection
of investors to grant such application.4. As a result of the Final Judgment, NBD and its affiliated persons are subject
to the disqualification provisions of section 9(a). Applicants assert that the application of such provisions to
applicants is unduly and disproportionately severe. Applicants further assert that NBD's conduct has been such
as not to make it against the public interest or protection of investors to grant the requested relief.

5. Applicants state that the conduct that gave rise to the Final Judgment was not in any way related to activities of
applicants as investment advisers. Applicants further state that neither applicants' senior management nor anyone
involved in the management of investment advisory services on applicants' behalf were involved in the activities
giving rise to the SEC Action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants assert that denial of the requested order would cause irreparable injury to applicants and to the Funds'
investors because the investors would no longer have the services of their investment adviser. In addition, investors
could be harmed by the uncertainty caused by applicants being prohibited from serving as investment advisers to the
Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. NBD has implemented policies and procedures designed to prevent a recurrence by other account holders of the type
of conduct that gave rise to the SEC Action. In addition, pursuant to the Final Judgment, NBD has taken or will take the
following steps to remedy its conduct and prevent the recurrence of violations:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. NBD will maintain policies and procedures to ensure that it complies with Regulation U, including policies to ensure
that purchases of securities in custodial accounts are not paid for with proceeds from sales of the same securities
in the accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Within thirty days after the entry of the Final Judgment, NBD will retain an independent consultant who will review
NBD's custodial securities clearing operations and who will make such recommendations as are necessary with respect
to NBD's policies and procedures to ensure that NBD complies with Regulation U.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The consultant will issue a report within sixty days of its retention setting forth its findings and recommendations
and will forward the report to the New York Regional Office.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Unless the Commission objects to the consultant's recommendations within thirty days, applicants will implement
the consultant's recommendations by no later than forty days after the end of the period for the Commission to object.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Notice of Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Odetics, Inc., Class A Common
Stock, $0.10 Par Value; Class B Common Stock, $0.10 Par Value) File No. 1&hyph;8762</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
December 28, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Odetics, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the
following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on November 18,
1993, to withdraw the Company's Class A and Class B Common Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common
Stock on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations/National Market Systems (``NASDAQ/NMS'').
According to the Company, the decision of the Board followed a lengthy study of the matter, and was based upon the belief
that listing of the Class A and Class B Common Stock on NASDAQ/NMS will be more beneficial to its stockholders than the
present listing on the Amex because:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Company believes that the liquidity may be improved through the multiple market maker system; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Company believes that the visibility and possibly research coverage may increase with improved liquidity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before January 20, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
VISX, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'')

According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on October 13,
1993, to withdraw the Company's Common Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common Stock on the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations/National Market System (``NASDAQ/NMS''). According
to the Company, the decision of the Board followed a lengthy study of the matter, and was based upon the belief that listing
of the Common Stock on NASDAQ/NMS will be more beneficial to its stockholders than the present listing on the Amex because:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system of competing market-makers will result in increased visibility
and sponsorship for the Common Stock than is presently the case with the single specialist assigned to the stock on
the Amex; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system will offer the Company's stockholders more liquidity than is
presently available on the Amex and less volatility in quoted prices per share when trading volume is slight; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Company believes that the NASDAQ/NMS system will offer the opportunity for the Company to secure its own group
of market-makers and, in doing so, expand the capital base available for trading in its Common Stock; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Company believes that firms making a market in the Company's Common Stock on the NASDAQ/NMS system will be inclined
to issue research reports concerning the Company, thereby increasing the number of firms providing institutional
research and advisory reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before January 20, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange

TVA committed to involving the public in developing plans for managing aquatic plants in individual TVA lakes under
a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement completed in August 1993. This proposed survey will provide a mechanism
for obtaining input into this planning process from a representative sample of people living near each lake. The information
obtained from the survey will be factored into the development of aquatic plant management plans for Chickamauga,
Kentucky, Wheeler, Nickajack and Guntersville Lakes.

 Section 3 of the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Public Law 102&hyph;4, 105 Stat. 11 (1991), directed the Secretary to enter
into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to review the scientific evidence concerning the association
between exposure to herbicides used in support of military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam
era and each disease suspected to be associated with such exposure. Congress mandated that NAS determine, to the extent
possible, (1) whether there is a statistical association between the suspect diseases and herbicide exposure, taking
into account the strength of the scientific evidence and the appropriateness of the methods used to detect the association;
(2) the increased risk of disease among individuals exposed to herbicides during service in the Republic of Vietnam
during the Vietnam era; and (3) whether there is a plausible biological mechanism or other evidence of a causal relationship
between herbicide exposure and the suspect disease.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2 of Public Law 102&hyph;4 provides that whenever the Secretary determines, based on sound medical and scientific
evidence, that a positive association (i.e., the credible evidence for the association is equal to or outweighs the
credible evidence against the association) exists between exposure of humans to an herbicide agent (i.e., a chemical
in an herbicide used in support of the United States and allied military operations in the Republic of Vietnam during
the Vietnam era) and a disease, the Secretary will publish regulations establishing presumptive service connection
for that disease. If the Secretary determines that a presumption of service connection is not warranted, he will publish
a notice of that determination, which includes an explanation of the scientific basis for that determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although Public Law 102&hyph;4 does not define ``credible'', it does instruct the Secretary to ``take into consideration
whether the results are statistically significant, are capable of replication, and withstand peer review.'' Simply
comparing the number of studies which report a positive relative risk to the number of studies which report a negative
relative risk for a particular condition is not a valid method for determining whether the weight of evidence overall
supports a finding that there is or is not a positive association between herbicide exposure and the subsequent development
of the particular condition. Because of differences in statistical significance, confidence levels, control for
confounding factors, etc., some studies are clearly more credible than others, and the Secretary has given them more
weight in evaluating the overall credibility of the evidence concerning specific diseases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing approximately 6,420 abstracts of scientific or medical articles and selecting approximately 230
epidemiologic studies for detailed analysis, consulting with outside experts, and conducting public hearings,
NAS issued a report, entitled ``Veterans and Agent Orange: Health Effects of Herbicides Used in Vietnam'', on July
27, 1993. The Secretary announced that same day that he had concluded that a positive association exists between exposure
to herbicides used in the Republic of Vietnam and the subsequent development of Hodgkin's disease and porphyria cutanea
tarda. Proposed regulations were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 28, 1993 (See 58 FR 50528&hyph;30). The Secretary also announced that VA would review the remaining findings
in the NAS report to determine whether a positive association exists between herbicide exposure and any other conditions.
That review has been completed and this notice, pursuant to Public Law 102&hyph;4, conveys the Secretary's determination
that there is no positive association between herbicide exposure and prostate cancer, peripheral neuropathy, hepatobiliary
cancers, bone cancers, female reproductive cancers, renal cancers, testicular cancer, leukemia, abnormal sperm
parameters and infertility, cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders, motor/coordination dysfunction, metabolic
and digestive disorders, immune system disorders, circulatory disorders, respiratory disorders (other than lung
cancer), nasal/nasopharyngeal cancer, skin cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, bladder cancer, brain tumors, and
any other condition for which the Secretary has not specifically determined a presumption of service connection
is warranted.

The NAS report assigns prostate cancer to a category labeled limited/suggestive evidence of an association, which
it defined as meaning there is evidence suggestive of an association between herbicide exposure and a particular
health outcome, but that evidence is limited because chance, bias, and confounding could not be ruled out with confidence.
Prostate cancer is a very common male genitourinary cancer which shows marked increased prevalence with age. There
are statistically significant occupational studies which show no association between prostate cancer and herbicide
exposure (e.g., Fingerhut M.A., Halperin W.E., Marlow D.A., Piacitelli L.A., Honchar P.A., Sweeney M.H., Greife
A.L., Dill P.A., Steenland K., Suruda A.J. 1991. Cancer mortality in workers exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.
New England Journal of Medicine 324:212&hyph;218; Manz A., Berger J., Dwyer J.H., Flesch-Janys D., Nagel S., Waltsgott
H. 1991. Cancer mortality among workers in chemical plant contaminated with dioxin. Lancet 338:959&hyph;964; Saracci
R., Kogevinas M., Bertazzi P.A., Bueno De Mesquita B.H., Coggon D., Green L.M., Kauppinen T., L'Abbe K.A., Littorin
M., Lynge E., Mathews J.D., Neuberger M., Osman J., Pearce N., Winkelman R. 1991. Cancer mortality in workers exposed
to chlorophenoxy herbicides and chlorophenois. Lancet 338:1027&hyph;1032). Some occupational studies have shown
a slight elevated risk for prostate cancer among farm and forestry workers (e.g., Burmeister L.F., 1981. Cancer mortality
in Iowa farmers: 1971&hyph;1978. Journal of the National Cancer Institute 66:461&hyph;464; Alavanja M.C., Merkle
S., Teske J. Eaton B., Reed B. 1989. Mortality among forest and soil conservationists. Archives of Environmental
Health 44:94&hyph;101); however, only one study concerning a small sub-set of farmers (Morrison H., Savitz, D.,
Semenciw R., Hulka B., Mao Y., Morison D., Wigle D. 1993. Farming and prostate cancer mortality. American Journal
of Epidemiology 137:270&hyph;280) associated the increased risk of prostate cancer among farmers specifically
with herbicide exposure. The Morrison study is so recent that it it too early to determine whether its results will
be replicated by other research. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association
between prostate cancer and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has
determined that a positive association does not exist.

The NAS report assigns peripheral neuropathy, hepatobiliary cancers, bone cancers, female reproductive cancers,
renal cancers, testicular cancer, leukemia, abnormal sperm parameters and infertility, cognitive and neuropsychiatric
disorders, motor/coordination dysfunction, metabolic and digestive disorders, immune system disorders, circulatory
disorders, respiratory disorders (other than lung cancer), and nasal/nasopharyngeal cancer to a category labeled
inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine whether an association exists, which is defined as meaning that
the available studies are of insufficient quality, consistency, or statistical strength to permit a conclusion
regarding the presence or absence of an association with herbicide exposure.

Peripheral neuropathy can be induced by many common medical and environmental disorders unrelated to herbicide
exposure, such as aging, alcoholism, diabetes, and exposure to other toxic chemicals. The last time VA considered
this issue, it determined, after receiving the advice of the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards,
that there was sufficient evidence to meet the requirements for a ``significant statistical association,'' the
standard in effect at that time, between exposure to herbicides containing dioxin and the subsequent development
of peripheral neuropathy under certain circumstances (See 57 FR 2236&hyph;38). That conclusion, however, relied
heavily on case reports, which are anecdotal and have no statistical significant, and occupational studies such
as Singer and colleagues (1982) (Singer R., Moses M., Valciukas J., Lilis R., Selikoff I.J., 1982. Nerve conduction
velocity studies of workers employed in the manufacture of phenoxy herbicides. Environmental Research 29:297&hyph;311)
whose credibility is compromised because they did not apply consistent methods to define a comparison group, determine
exposure, evaluate clinical deficits, use standard definitions of peripheral neuropathy, or eliminate confounding
variables. The Singer study, for example, excluded individuals with excessive alcohol consumption from the controls
but not from the subjects of the study. Other occupational studies, such as Suskind and Herzberg (1984) (Suskind R.R.,
Hertzberg V.S., 1984. Human health effects of 2,4,5&hyph;T and its toxic contaminants. Journal of the American Medical
Association 251:2372&hyph;2380), which did not have those methodological problems, showed no difference in the
incidence of peripheral neuropathy for workers exposed to herbicides and workers not so exposed. Accordingly, the
Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between peripheral neuropathy and herbicide
exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that a positive association
does not exist.

Hepatobiliary cancers are cancers of the liver and bile duct. There are a variety of risk factors that should be considered
by a credible study, including hepatitis B and C, alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, exposure to polychlorinated biphenyl
(PCB), and smoking. The relevant studies are few, and have not adequately controlled for these risk factors. A Swedish
case control study (Hardell L., Bengtsson N.O., Jonsson U., Eriksson S., Larsson L.G., 1984. Aetiological aspects
on primary liver cancer with special regard to alcohol, organic solvents and acute intermittent porphyria: an epidemiological
investigation. British Journal of Cancer 50:389&hyph;397) showed a relationship between herbicide exposure and
the subsequent development of hepatobiliary cancer; however, other studies of similar size (Ronco G, Costa G., Lynge
E., 1992. Cancer risk among Danish and Italian farmers. British Journal of Industrial Medicine 49:220&hyph;225;
Wiklund K., 1983. Swedish agricultural workers: a group with a decreased risk of cancer. Cancer 51:566&hyph;568)
indicated no relationship. A large occupational study (Fingerhut et al., 1991) and a study of farmers in Denmark and
Italy (Ronco et al., 1992) found no relationship. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence
against an association between hepatobiliary cancer and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for
such an association, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bone cancers were considered together with joint cancers by NAS. Because of the rarity of bone cancers, most studies
have been too small to detect a significant risk. There has not been a consistent finding of bone cancer in exposed groups;
the preponderance of studies show no association, and the few studies that demonstrate a positive relationship (Fingerhut
et al., 1991; Breslin P., Kang H., Lee y., Burt V., Shepard B.M., 1988. Proportionate mortality study of U.S. Army and
U.S. Marine Corps veterans of the Vietnam War. Journal of Occupational Medicine 30:412&hyph;419) are small and have
large confidence intervals which include one. The small size of the studies and the confidence limitations compromise
their significance. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between
bone cancers and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined
that a positive association does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Female reproductive cancers reviewed by NAS include those of the breast, uterus, cervix, ovary, and other genital
malignancies. The data related to women and herbicide exposure is extremely limited because few of the studies included
women. A large number of the breast cancer studies showed no association. Two studies (Thomas T.L., Kang H., Dalager
N., 1991. Mortality among women Vietnam veterans, 1973&hyph;1987. American Journal of Epidemiology 134:973&hyph;980;
Manz et al., 1991) showed an increased risk for breast cancer which was not significant since both studies failed to
control for reproductive histories and had methodological problems. Only one small case control study (Donna A.,
Betta P&hyph;G., Robutti F., Crosignani P., Berrino F., Bellingeri D., 1984. Ovarian mesothelial tumors and herbicides:
a case control study. Carcinogenesis 5:941&hyph;942) showed an association with ovarian cancer, but the confidence
intervals were very wide. The larger occupational and farm worker studies all showed significantly lower mortality
ratios than expected. Likewise, studies of exposures generally found less uterine and cervical cancer than expected.
Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between female reproductive
cancers and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that
a positive association does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The leather industry, asbestos, cadmium, petroleum products, analgesics, smoking, and obesity have been associated
with renal cancers. Studies of renal cancer have generally produced inconclusive results, in some cases because
of failure to adequately control for these confounding factors. Only one study of agricultural and forest workers
(Alavanja et al., 1989) showed a significantly increased risk of death from renal cancers; however, the preponderance
of studies, including the two largest (Wiklund, 1983; Burmeister, 1981), showed either no relationship with renal
cancers or increased risk which was not significant. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence
against an association between renal cancers and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an
association, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.

Major risk factors for testicular cancer are undescended testis and other factors, such as genetic abnormalities,
infections, etc., which produce atrophy and dysfunction. In general, occupational studies (Ronco et al., 1992;
Wiklund, 1983) have shown no association between herbicide exposure and testicular cancer. Occupational and environmental
studies have found either no association or increased risk which was not significant. Studies concerning Vietnam
veterans were inconsistent, and in those that found increased risk, that risk was generally not significant. Accordingly,
the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between testicular cancer and herbicide
exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that a positive association
does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Potential evidence for an association between herbicide exposure and leukemia comes primarily from studies of farmers
(Ronco et al., 1992; Wigle D.T., Semenciw R.B., Wilkins K., Riedel D., Ritter L., Morrison H.I., Mao Y., 1990. Mortality
study of Canadian male farm operators: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma mortality and agricultural practices in Saskatchewan.
Journal of the National Cancer Institute 82:575&hyph;582) and residents of Seveso, Italy (Bertazzi P.A., Zocchetti
C., Pesatori A.C., Guercilena S., Sanarico M., Radice L., 1989b. Ten-year mortality study of the population involved
in the Seveso incident in 1976. American Journal of Epidemiology 129:1187&hyph;1200; Bertazzi P.A., Zocchetti
C., Pesatori A.C., Guercilena S., Consonni D., Tironi A., Landi M.T., 1992. Mortality of a young population after
accidental exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin. International Journal of Epidemiology 21:118&hyph;123).
The studies of farmers did not control for other confounding exposures (Brownson R.C., Reif J.S., Chang J.C., Davis
J.R., 1989. Cancer risk among Missouri farmers. Cancer 64:2381&hyph;2385.; Brown L.M., Blair A., Gibson R., Everett
G.D., Cantor K.P., Schuman L.M., Burmeister L.F., Van Lier S.F., Dick F. 1990. Pesticide exposures and other agricultural
risk factors for leukemia among men in Iowa and Minnesota. Cancer Research 50:6585&hyph;6591). When farmers were
stratified by suspected herbicide exposure, the incidence of leukemia was generally not elevated. Any elevation
appeared to be due to factors other than herbicide exposure, e.g., risk was higher among chicken farmers than wheat
farmers (Alavanja M.C., Blair A, Merkle S., Teske J. Eaton B., 1988. Mortality among agricultural extension agents.
American Journal of Industrial Medicine 14:167&hyph;176). The suggestive evidence of increased risk concerning
Seveso, Italy was not significant because of the small number of actual cases in which leukemia was found. Since none
of the studies demonstrated a dose-response for any subtype of leukemia, it is not possible to attribute leukemia
to herbicide exposure. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between
leukemia and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that
a positive association does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The common parameters used to evaluate toxic effects to sperm are number, motility, structure, and morphology. Many
chemicals have been implicated in interfering with motility and sperm structure (Wyrobek A.J., Gordon L.A., Burkhart
J.G., Francis M.W., Kapp R.W., Letz G., Malling H.V., Topham J.C., Whorton M.D., 1983. An evaluation of human sperm
as indicators of chemically induced alterations of spermatogenic function. A report of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency Gene-Tox Program. Mutation Research 115:73&hyph;148). One occupational study (Lerda D., Rizzi R., 1991.
Study of reproductive function in persons occupationally exposed to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4&hyph;D).
Mutation Research 262:47&hyph;50) and one study of Vietnam veterans (Air Force Health Study (AFHS), 1992. An Epidemiologic
Investigation of Health Effects in Air Force Personnel Following Exposure to Herbicides. Reproductive Outcomes.
Brooks AFB: USAF School of Aerospace Medicine. AL&hyph;TR&hyph;992&hyph;0900 602 pp.) found no association with
decreased sperm count. Another study of Vietnam veterans (Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 1989. Comparison of
Serum Levels of 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin with Indirect Estimates of Agent Orange Exposure Among Vietnam
Veterans: Final Report. Atlanta: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) found lower sperm concentration
and reduced sperm motility, but suggested these outcomes may be associated with the Vietnam experience rather than
exposure to herbicides. Infertility usually incorporates two concepts: the inability to conceive and the inability
to produce live children. Most studies do not take into account the desire for children, contraceptive practices,
and other factors influencing fertility. NAS found no occupational or environmental studies examining herbicide
exposure and infertility, and veteran studies (Field B., Kerr C., 1988. Reproductive behavior and consistent patterns
of abnormality in offspring of Vietnam veterans. Journal of Medical Genetics 25:819&hyph;826; AFHS, 1992; Centers
for Disease Control (CDC), 1988. Health status of Vietnam veterans. III. Reproductive outcomes and child health.
Journal of the American Medical Association 259:2715&hyph;2717) do not support an association between herbicide
exposure and infertility. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association
between abnormal sperm parameters and infertility and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such
an association, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.

Studies of cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders are beset by a number of methodologic problems, including exposure
measures, the wide variety of ``standardized'' test instruments used, and the inability to detect or correct for
other influences on test results such as emotional state, non-neurologic disease, metabolic conditions, fatigue,
medications, or style of the examiner. Because of their failure to adequately control for these confounding factors,
these studies lack credibility in assessing the relationship of herbicide exposure to these conditions. Accordingly,
the Secretary has found that there is no credible evidence for an association between cognitive and neuropsychiatric
disorders and herbicide exposure, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were no significant studies available to analyze whether an association exists between herbicide exposure
and motor/coordination dysfunction. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that there is no credible evidence for
an association between motor/coordination dysfunction and herbicide exposure, and he has determined that a positive
association does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Metabolic and digestive disorders (diabetes mellitus, hepatic enzyme abnormality, lipid abnormalities, and ulcers)
were also categorized by NAS as health outcomes with inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine whether an association
exists. Although NAS found no biologic basis to suspect an association between herbicide exposure and diabetes,
abnormal glucose tolerance tests have been reported in three studies (Sweeney M.H., Fingerhut M.A., Arezzo J.C.,
Hornung R.W., Connally L.B. In press. Peripheral neuropathy after occupational exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
(TCDD).; Air Force Health Study. 1991. An Epidemiologic Investigation of Health Effects in Air Force Personnel Following
Exposure to Herbicides. Serum Dioxin Analysis of 1987 Examination Results. Brooks AFB, TX: USAF School of Aerospace
Medicine. 9 vols.; Pazderova-Vejlupkova J., Lukas E., Nemcova M., Pickova J., Jirasek L., 1991. The development
and prognosis of chronic intoxication by tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in men. Archives of Environmental Health
36:5&hyph;11). While this suggests such an association, the evidence is inconclusive and its credibility is questionable
because an abnormal glucose tolerance test is not an absolute indicator of diabetes and none of these studies allowed
for the confounding role of obesity. Two other studies found no association (Moses M., Lilis R., Crow K.D., Thornton
J., Fischbein A., Anderson H.A., Selikoff I.J., 1984. Health status of workers with past exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin
in the manufacture of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid: Comparison of findings with and without chloracne. American
Journal of Industrial Medicine 5:161&hyph;182; Suskind and Hertzberg, 1984), and a number of studies have shown
no increased death rates from diabetes (Bertazzi et al., 1989; Cook R.R., Bond G.G., Olson R.A., Ott M.G., 1987. Update
of the mortality experience of workers exposed to chlorinated dioxins. Chemosphere 16:2111&hyph;2116; Henneberger
P.K., Ferris B.G. Jr., Monson R.R., 1989. Mortality among pulp and paper workers in Berlin, New Hampshire. British
Journal of Industrial Medicine 46:658&hyph;664). Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence
against an association between diabetes and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association,
and he has determined that a positive associations does not exist.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The studies related to hepatic enzyme abnormality did not demonstrate an association with liver disease, and confounding
factors (alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, hepatitis, and other toxic chemicals) were not ruled out. Studies showing lipid
abnormalities do not control for the confounding variables of obesity and genetic factors, and no medical significance
of the modest and variable increases has been demonstrated. The risk of gastric ulcers in exposed populations has
not been sufficiently studied to establish an association with herbicide exposure. Only one study (Suskind and Hertzberg,
1984) indicates any increase, and in that study it is difficult to rule out the many factors (e.g., alcoholism, non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, and H. pylori infection) known to be associated with ulcers. Accordingly, the Secretary
has found that there is no credible evidence for an association between metabolic and digestive disorders (other
than diabetes) and herbicide exposure, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The available data deal with two categories of immune system disorders: immune modulation and autoimmunity. Many
immune parameters have been studied; however, few show a relationship to herbicide exposure. Most studies address
such a wide range of immune parameters that it is likely that at least some of the positive results are due to chance alone,
which undermines the credibility of those studies. Furthermore, the clinical meaning, i.e., the relationship of
immune disorders to disease, is unclear. Other studies (e.g., Pocchiari F., Silano V., Zampieri A., 1979. Human health
effects from accidental release of tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) at Seveso, Italy. Annals of the New York
Academy of Sciences 320:311&hyph;320; Ghezzi I., Cannatelli P., Assennato G., Merlo F., Mocarelli P., Brambilla
P., Sicurello F., 1982. Potential 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin exposure of Seveso decontamination workers.
A controlled prospective study. Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment, and Health 8:176&hyph;179) found no
relationship between immune system disorders and herbicide exposure. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that
the credible evidence against an association between immune system disorders and herbicide exposure outweighs
the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most occupational studies concerning circulatory disorders (e.g., Moses et al., 1984; Suskind and Hertzberg, 1984)
showed no increased mortality or morbidity from circulatory disorders after herbicide exposure. The studies of
the residents of Seveso, Italy (Bertazzi, P.A., Zocchetti C., Pesatori A.C., Guercilena S., Sanarico M., Radice
L., 1989a. Mortality in an area contaminated by TCDD following an industrial incident. Medicina Del Lavoro 80:316&hyph;329;
Bertazzi et al., 1989b) showed some increased risk of mortality in the first five year follow-up; however, these studies
had a number of technical problems: they were not specific to circulatory disease and did not control for the confounding
variables of smoking, diabetes, and hypertension. Veteran studies (e.g., CDC, 1988) have suggested that any increase
in heart disease may be associated with the Vietnam experience rather than herbicide exposure, and most of these studies
did not adjust for confounding variables. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against
an association between circulatory diseases and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an
association, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAS examined studies that covered a wide variety of respiratory disorders (e.g., chronic bronchitis, asthma, pleurisy,
pneumonia, and tuberculosis), other than respiratory cancer. Studies of individuals exposed in occupational settings
revealed no increase in mortality from respiratory disease (Coggon D., Pannett B., Winter P., 1991. Mortality and
incidence of cancer at four factories making phenoxy herbicides. British Journal of Industrial Medicine 48:173&hyph;178;
Blair A., 1983. Lung cancer and other causes of death among licensed pesticide applicators. Journal of the National
Cancer Institute 71:31&hyph;37; Alavanja et al., 1989; Coggon D., Pannett B., Winter P.D., Acheson E.D., Bonsall
J., 1986. Mortality of workers exposed to 2-methyl_chlorophenoxyacetic acid. Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment,
and Health 12:448&hyph;454). Environmental exposure studies similarly showed no significant differences in mortality
due to respiratory disease (Bertazzi et al., 1989a,b). Also, mortality studies of Vietnam veterans generally found
no increased risk.

Morbidity data are generally difficult to evaluate because of methodological problems and because studies focused
on symptoms, lung function tests and x-ray interpretation rather than disease (e.g., Calvert et al., 1991; Pollei
S., Mettler F.A. Jr., Kelsey C.A., Walters M.R., White R.E., 1986. Follow-up chest radiographs in Vietnam veterans:
Are they useful? Radiology 161:101&hyph;102). One occupational study (Calvert G.M., Sweeney M.H., Morris J.A.,
Fingerhut M.A., Hornung R.W., Halperin W.E., 1991. Evaluation of chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and ventilatory function among workers exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. American Review
of Respiratory Disease 144:1302&hyph;1306) showed no excess morbidity; another occupational study (Suskind and
Hertzberg, 1984) found increased symptomatology of respiratory disease, but did not adequately control for the
confounding factor of age. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association
between respiratory disorders and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association,
and he has determined that a positive association does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAS noted an association between nasal cancers and occupational exposure to nickel and to chromates. Exposure to
wood dust is also a risk factor for nasal cancers; smoking and exposure to formaldehyde may increase the risk associated
with wood dust. There is also evidence that leather workers have an increased risk for nasal cancers, and that there
is an association between chronic nasal diseases and consumption of salt-preserved foods. Most studies (e.g., Wiklund,
1983; Ronco et al., 1992) showed inconclusive results, and often did not control for confounding variables. Two other
epidemiological studies based on the same three cases (Saracci et al., 1991; Coggon D., Pannett B., Winter P.D., Acheson
E.D., Bonsall J., 1986. Mortality of workers exposed to 2 methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid. Scandinavian Journal
of Work, Environment, and Health 12:448&hyph;454) and one case-control study (Hardell L., Johansson B., Axelson
O., 1982. Epidemiological study of nasal and nasopharyngeal cancer and their relation to phenoxy acid or chlorophenol
exposure. American Journal of Industrial Medicine 3:247&hyph;257) showed increased risk associated with herbicide
exposure; however, that risk was not statistically significant, which diminishes the importance of these studies.
Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between nasal/nasopharyngeal
cancers and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that
a positive association does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAS also reviewed the literature with respect to possible associations between herbicide exposure and various reproductive
effects, i.e., spontaneous abortion, birth defects, neonatal infant deaths and stillbirths, low birth weight,
and childhood cancers in offspring. These reproductive effects were categorized by NAS as health outcomes with inadequate/insufficient
evidence to determine whether an association exists because the studies were of inadequate statistical power for
specific birth defects, contained a limited sample size, and/or failed to exclude bias and chance. It should be noted
that to compensate a veteran for these conditions is beyond VA's authority (See title 38, U.S.C.) and would require
enabling legislation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAS assigns four diseases or categories of diseases to a category labeled limited/suggestive evidence of no association
with herbicide exposure which it defined as meaning that several adequate studies, covering the full range of levels
of exposure that humans are known to encounter, are mutually consistent in not showing a positive association between
herbicide exposure and the particular health outcome at any level of exposure. The conditions include skin cancer,
gastrointestinal tumors (stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and rectal cancer), bladder cancer,
and brain tumors. There were many credible studies (See NAS Report, Chapter 8) concerning all of these conditions
that showed no association or a negative association with herbicide exposure. Accordingly, the Secretary has found
that there is no credible evidence for an association between skin cancer, gastrointestinal tumors (stomach cancer,
pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and rectal cancer), bladder cancer, and brain tumors and herbicide exposure, and
he has determined that a positive association does not exist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAS reviewed approximately 6,420 abstracts of scientific or medical articles as an integral part of the process that
resulted in its report, entitled ``Veterans and Agent Orange: Health Effects of Herbicides Used in Vietnam.'' From
these articles, approximately 230 epidemiologic studies, including studies of people exposed to herbicides in
occupational and environmental settings as well as studies of Vietnam veterans, were chosen for detailed review
and analysis. In our judgment, the comprehensive review and evaluation of the available literature which NAS conducted
in conjunction with its report has permitted us to identify all conditions for which the current body of knowledge
supports a finding of an association with herbicide exposure. Accordingly, the Secretary has determined that there
is no positive association between exposure to herbicides and any other condition for which he has not specifically
determined that a presumption of service connection is warranted.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), U.S. Department of Commerce, announces
that applications are available for planning and construction grants for public telecommunications facilities
under the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program (PTFP), which is administered by NTIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicants for grants under the PTFP must file their applications on or before March 17, 1994. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NTIA anticipates making grant awards by September 30, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately $21.3 million is available in fiscal year 1994 for grants. The amount of a grant award will vary depending
on the project of the applicant. NTIA awarded $20.8 million in funds to 105 projects for fiscal year 1993. The awards
ranged from $1,898 to $968,989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Final Rules and Policy Statement for the Public Telecommunications Facilities Program were published on November
22, 1991 (56 FR 59168&hyph;59192, No. 226). These rules, codified at 15 CFR part 2301, will be in effect for 1994 applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prospective PTFP applicants should be aware that NTIA is in the process of establishing a new National Information
Infrastructure grant program to be called the Information Infrastructure Grants Program (IIGP). The IIGP's funds
may be used for the planning and construction of telecommunications networks or the purchase of telecommunications
services and facilities for the provision of educational, cultural, health care, public information, public safety
or other social services. The Congress appropriated $26 million dollars for the IIGP in FY 1994. Formal announcement
of the IIGP will be made at a later date. The new IIGP is separate from the already-existing grant program, the PTFP,
which is the subject of this Notice. The PTFP or its predecessor-agencies have been in operation since 1962; the present
PTFP program has been in place since 1978.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
II. Program Goals and Priorities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Goals of this program as stated in section 390 of the Communications Act (47 U.S.C. 390) are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``To assist through matching grants, in the planning and construction of public telecommunications facilities
in order to achieve the following objectives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Extend delivery of public telecommunications services to as many citizens of the United States as possible by
the most efficient and economical means, including the use of broadcast and nonbroadcast technologies;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Increase public telecommunications services and facilities available to, operated by, and owned by minorities
and women; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Strengthen the capability of existing public television and radio stations to provide public telecommunications
services to the public.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has established the following priorities for the PTFP:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Special Applications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
NTIA possesses the discretionary authority to recommend awarding grants to eligible broadcast and nonbroadcast
applicants whose proposals are so unique or innovative that they do not clearly fall within the priorities listed
below. Innovative projects submitted under this category must address demonstrated and substantial community
needs (e.g., service to identifiable ethnic or linguistic minority audiences, service to the blind or deaf, electronic
text, and nonbroadcast projects offering educational or instructional services).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
Priority 1_Provision of Public Telecommunications Facilities for First Radio and Television Signals to a Geographic
Area
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
There are three subcategories:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Projects that include local origination capacity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This subcategory includes the planning or construction of new facilities that can provide a full range of radio and/or
television programs including material that is locally produced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Projects that do not include local origination capacity.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This subcategory includes projects such as increases in tower height and/or power of existing stations and construction
of translators, cable networks, and repeater transmitters that will result in providing public telecommunications
services to previously unserved areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Projects that provide first nationally distributed programming.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This subcategory includes projects that provide satellite downlink facilities to noncommercial radio and television
stations that would bring nationally distributed programming to a geographic area for the first time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Priority 1 and its subcategories apply only to grant applicants proposing to plan or construct new facilities to bring
public telecommunications services to geographic areas that are presently unserved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Priority 2_Replacement of Basic Equipment of Existing Essential Broadcast Stations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Projects eligible for consideration under this category include the urgent replacement of obsolete or worn out equipment
in existing broadcast stations that provide either the only public telecommunications signal or the only locally
originated public telecommunications signal to a geographical area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Priority 3_Establishment of a First Local Origination Capacity in a Geographical Area
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Projects in this category include the planning or construction of facilities to bring the first local origination
capacity to an area already receiving public telecommunications services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Priority 4_Replacement and Improvement of Basic Equipment for Existing Broadcast Stations

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Projects eligible for consideration under this category include the replacement of obsolete or worn-out equipment
and the upgrading of existing origination or delivery capacity to current industry performance standards. There
are two subcategories:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Under Priority 4A, NTIA will consider applications to replace urgently needed equipment from public broadcasting
stations that do not meet the Priority 2 criteria because they do not provide either the only public telecommunications
signal or the only locally originated public telecommunications signal to a geographic area. NTIA will also consider
applications that improve as well as replace urgently needed production-related equipment at public radio and television
stations that do not qualify for Priority 2 consideration but that produce, on a continuing basis, significant amounts
of programming distributed nationally to public radio or television stations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This subcategory will also enable the acquisition of satellite downlinks for public radio stations in areas already
served by one or more full-service public radio stations. The applicant must demonstrate that it will broadcast a
program schedule that does not merely duplicate what is already available in its service area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final projects included in this subcategory would enable the acquisition of the necessary items of equipment
to bring the inventory of an already-operating station to the basic level of equipment requirements established
by PTFP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. This subcategory includes the improvement and non-urgent replacement of equipment at any public broadcasting
station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Priority 5_Augmentation of Existing Broadcast Stations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Projects in this category would equip an existing station beyond a basic capacity to broadcast programming from distant
sources and to originate local programming.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Projects to equip auxiliary studios at remote locations, or to provide mobile origination facilities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 An applicant must demonstrate that significant expansion in public participation in programming will result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Projects to augment production capacity beyond basic level in order to provide programming or related materials
for other than local distribution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This subcategory would provide equipment for the production of programming for regional or national use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Application Forms and Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To apply for a PTFP grant, an applicant must file a timely and complete application on a current form approved by the
Agency. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
No previous versions of the PTFP Application Form may be used.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, the current application form has been cleared under OMB control
no. 0660&hyph;0003.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All persons and organizations on the PTFP's mailing list will be sent a copy of the current application form and the
Final Rules. Those not on the mailing list may obtain copies by contacting the PTFP at the address above. Prospective
applicants should read the Final Rules carefully before submitting applications. Applicants whose applications
were deferred will be mailed pertinent PTFP materials and instructions for requesting reactivation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants should note that they must comply with the provisions of Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental
Review of Federal Programs.'' The Executive Order requires applicants for financial assistance under this program
to file a copy of their application with the Single Points of Contact (SPOC) of all states relevant to the project. Applicants
are required to serve a copy of their completed application on the appropriate SPOC on or before March 17, 1994. Applicants
are encouraged to contact the appropriate SPOC well before the NTIA closing date.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NTIA requires that all applicants whose proposed projects need authorization from the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) must tender an application to the FCC for such authority on or before March 17, 1994. (An application is tendered
to the FCC when it has been received by the Secretary of the FCC.) However, applicants are urged to submit it with as much
lead time before the PTFP closing date as possible. The greater the lead time, the better the chance the FCC application
will be processed to coincide with NTIA's grant cycle. NTIA may return the application of any applicant which fails
to tender an application to the FCC for any necessary authority on or before March 17, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Effective October 1, 1988, OMB Circular A&hyph;102, as it applies to grant recipients, has been superseded by Department
of Commerce regulations, Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements with State
and Local Governments (53 FR 8034, codified at 15 CFR 24 (1988)). Applicants should note that PTFP grant recipients,
depending on their type of organization, are subject to the provisions of diverse Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) Circulars; i.e., A&hyph;87 ``Cost Principles for State and Local Governments,'' A&hyph;21 ``Cost Principles
for Educational Institutions,'' A&hyph;110, A&hyph;122, A&hyph;128, as implemented by 15 CFR part 29a, and A&hyph;133,
as implemented by 15 CFR part 29b.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indirect costs for construction applications are not supported by this program. The total dollar amount of the indirect
costs proposed in a planning application under this program must not exceed the indirect cost rate negotiated and
approved by a cognizant Federal agency prior to the proposed effective date of the award or 100 percent of the total
proposed direct costs dollar amount in the application, whichever is less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All non-profit applicants are subject to a name check review process. Name checks are intended to reveal if any key
individuals associated with the applicant have been convicted of or are presently facing criminal charges such as
fraud, theft, perjury, or other matters which significantly reflect on the applicant's management honesty or financial
integrity. Potential grant recipient organizations may also be subject to reviews of Dun and Bradstreet data or other
similar credit checks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All primary applicants must submit a completed Form CD&hyph;511, ``Certifications Regarding Debarment, Suspension,
and Other Responsibility Matters; Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and Lobbying.'' Applicants are further advised

V. Matching Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Planning grants. A Federal grant for the planning of a public telecommunications facility shall be in an amount

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Special Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As originally stated in the August 20, 1987, PTFP Final Rules, and as reaffirmed and clarified in a November 22, 1991,
PTFP Policy Statement, NTIA has established a policy which is intended to encourage stations to increase from 25%
to 50% the matching percentage in their proposals for equipment replacement, improvement, and augmentation. The
Agency has emphasized that applicants proposing to provide first service to a geographic area encounter considerable
ineligible costs, including construction or renovation of buildings or other similar expenses. NTIA, therefore,
expects to continue funding projects to extend service at up to 75% of the total project cost. Applicants from small
community-licensed stations, or those who can show that a station licensed to a large institution cannot obtain direct
or in-kind support from the larger institution, also will not be subject to this preference. Otherwise, a showing
of extraordinary need or an emergency situation will be taken into consideration as justification for grants of up
to 75% of the project cost, but the presumption of 50% funding will be the general rule for applications calling for
the replacement, improvement, or augmentation of equipment.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) No part of the grantee's matching share of the eligible project costs may be met with funds paid by the Federal government,
except where the use of such funds to meet a Federal matching requirement is specifically and expressly authorized
by Federal statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Funds supplied to an applicant by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting may not be used for the required non-Federal
matching purposes, except upon a clear and compelling showing of need.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The expenditure of any local matching funds prior to the Closing Date will be disallowed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Applicants should note that expenditure of local matching funds prior to the award of a grant is at the applicant's
own risk. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The exact amount of the match will not be known with certainty until the final award agreement is negotiated. Therefore,
should the applicant's expenditure of non-Federal funds exceed the non-Federal share which will be established
in the final award agreement, then either the Federal share of the total project cost may be reduced by a corresponding
amount, or no Federal award may be offered.

VI. Selection Process and Project Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PTFP grants are awarded on the basis of a competitive review process. This includes several grant review panels, which
apply the Funding Criteria listed in section V above. The Agency determines the selection of grantees according to
the Priorities listed in section III above and the evaluation of the applications by the various review panels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Planning grant award periods customarily do not exceed one year, whereas construction grant award periods commonly
range up to two years. Although these time frames are generally applied to the award of all PTFP grants, variances in
project periods may be based on specific circumstances of an individual proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This competition is authorized under the Community Outreach Partnership Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 5307 note; hereafter
referred to as the ``COPC Act''). The COPC Act is contained in section 851 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992). Section 801(c) of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 provides for a $7.5 million set-aside for each year of the 5-year demonstration authorized in the COPC Act.
(The funds appropriated by Congress for FY 1993 were rescinded by the 1993 Supplemental Appropriations Act, Pub.
L. 103&hyph;50, approved July 2, 1993.)

B. Allocation and Form of Award 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The competition in this NOFA is for $7.0 million to fund the first year of the Community Outreach Partnership Centers
(COPC) Program authorized as indicated above. An additional $500,000 will be used to fund the first year of the National
Clearinghouse mandated by section 851(j) of the COPC Act. A separate announcement will be issued at a later date for
the National Clearinghouse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each grant made under the COPC program will be for a maximum two year period of performance. The maximum size of any grant
will be $750,000, while the minimum will be $250,000. Each applicant must submit an application within this range.
In future years, successful applicants will have to compete for funds with all other applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Description of Competition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Congress has mandated that the Department carry out ``a 5-year demonstration to determine the feasibility of
facilitating partnerships between institutions of higher education and communities to solve urban problems through
research, outreach and the exchange of information.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The COPC Act stipulates that grants are to go to public and private institutions of higher education to establish and
operate Community Outreach Partnership Centers (COPC). These centers shall: ``(a) Conduct competent and qualified
research and investigation on theoretical or practical problems in large and small cities; and (B) Facilitate partnerships
and outreach activities between institutions of higher education, local communities, and local governments to
address urban problems.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific problems that grants under the COPC program must focus on are ``problems associated with housing, economic
development, neighborhood revitalization, infrastructure, health care, job training, education, crime prevention,
planning, community organizing, and other areas deemed appropriate by the Secretary.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the COPC Act states: ``The Secretary shall give preference to institutions of higher education that
undertake research and outreach activities by bringing together knowledge and expertise in the various social science
and technical disciplines that relate to urban problems.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is clear from the statutory language quoted above, and the program requirements and selection criteria detailed
below, that Congress intended that COPC be multi-disciplined, combine research with outreach, work with communities
and local governments and address the multi-dimensional problems that beset urban areas. To be most effective during
the term of the demonstration, the assisted research must have a clear near-term potential for solving specific significant
urban problems. The selected institutions must have the capacity to apply their research results and to work with
communities and local institutions, including neighborhood groups, in applying research results to specific real-life
urban problems, including design of comprehensive strategies and consolidated housing and community development
plans to resolve these problems.

A. Rating Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will use the following criteria to rate and rank applications received in response to this NOFA. The factors and
maximum points for each factor are provided below. The maximum number of points is 100. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rating of the ``applicant'' or the ``applicant's organization and staff'', unless otherwise specified, will include
any sub-contractors, consultants and sub-recipients which are firmly committed to the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) (10 points) The demonstrated research resources available to the applicant for carrying out the purposes of the
COPC Act. In rating this factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant's organization and staff have
recent, relevant and successful experience in undertaking research activities in specific communities which have
clear near-term potential for practical application to significant urban problems associated with housing, economic
development, neighborhood revitalization, infrastructure, health care, job training, education, crime prevention,
planning and community organizing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) (10 points) The demonstrated outreach resources available to the applicant for carrying out the purposes of the
COPC Act. In rating this factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant's organization and staff have
recent, relevant and successful experience in applying research results through outreach activities, including
the provision of technical expertise and assistance, to solve or ameliorate the impact of significant urban problems
associated with the areas listed in factor 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) (5 points) The demonstrated commitment of the applicant to supporting research and outreach programs by providing
matching contributions for the Federal assistance received. In rating this factor, HUD will provide an increasing
number of points for increasing amounts of contributions beyond the statutory 50 percent for research and 25 percent

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) (10 points) The capability of the applicant to provide leadership in solving community problems and in making
national contributions to solving long-term and immediate urban problems. HUD will evaluate the two parts of this
factor separately, giving them equal weight. In rating the first sub-factor, HUD will consider the extent to which
the institution of higher education can demonstrate that it has taken a leadership position in solving specific community
problems in the past. In rating the second sub-factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant can demonstrate
that its published research and other activities place it in a leadership position toward making a national contribution
to solving longer-term and immediate urban problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) (15 points) The extent of need in the communities to be served by the applicant. HUD will consider the extent to which
the proposal clearly delineates a need or needs in the affected communities that can be resolved through the activities
of a COPC. The applicant must demonstrate how these needs were determined and how the COPC will help resolve these needs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) (7 points) The demonstrated ability of the applicant to disseminate results of research and successful strategies
developed through outreach activities to other COPC and communities served through this demonstration program.
In rating this factor, HUD will evaluate the past experience of the applicant's staff and the scope and potential of
the applicant's proposal to serve as a local/regional clearinghouse or use other means to disseminate information
on its own and other COPC research results and strategies to: (a) Local communities in its area and (b) other communities
and COPC through the National Clearinghouse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) (15 points) The projects and activities that the applicant proposes to carry out under the grant. In rating this
factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant's proposal effectively addresses the following: (a)
Identifies specific communities (including colonias, where appropriate), neighborhoods within communities,
local institutions and neighborhood groups to be assisted by the Center; (b) demonstrates that one or more effective
community advisory committees comprised of representatives of local institutions and a balance of racial/ethnic,
gender and income mix of residents of the communities (and, where appropriate, colonias) to be served has been or will
be formed to participate in identifying local needs to be addressed by the Center and to form a partnership with the
Center to develop and implement strategies to address those needs; (c) outlines a clear research agenda related to
local needs that can be successfully carried out within the period of this grant and plan for involving the community
advisory committee(s) in the execution of that agenda; (d) demonstrates how it will design a comprehensive strategy
to resolve community and neighborhood problems; and (e) demonstrates how it will assist communities to improve consolidated
housing and community development plans and remove impediments to design and implementation of such plans. (Other
projects and activities required of a COPC, being evaluated under other factors, include: Providing outreach activities
to communities; acting as a clearinghouse for disseminating information; facilitating public service projects
and coordinating outreach activities in communities to be served by the Center, and exchanging information with
other centers.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) (18 points) The effectiveness of the applicant's strategy to provide outreach activities to communities. In
rating this factor, HUD will consider the extent to which: (a) The application identifies a clear outreach agenda
related to locally-identified needs that can be successfully carried out within the period of this grant and a plan
for involving the community advisory committee(s) in the execution of that agenda; (b) the outreach agenda includes
design of a community strategy to resolve community and neighborhood problems; (c) the outreach agenda includes
training projects for local community leaders, when appropriate; (d) the outreach program provides for on-site
or a frequent presence in the communities and neighborhoods to be assisted through outreach activities; and (e) the
outreach agenda includes assistance to communities for the design of consolidated housing and community development
plans and removal of impediments to design and implementation of such plans.

B. Selection Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications for funding under this NOFA will be evaluated competitively and points will be awarded as specified
in the Rating Factors section described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After assigning points based upon the factors all applications will be listed in rank order. Applications will then
be funded in rank order until all available funds have been expended. However, in order to be funded, an applicant must
receive a minimum score of 70. HUD reserves the right to fund all or portions of the proposed activities identified
in each application, based upon the eligibility of the proposed activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If two or more applications have the same number of points, the application with the most points for rating factor (8)
shall be selected. If there is still a tie, the application with the most points for rating factor (7) shall be selected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the amount of funds remaining after funding as many of the highest ranking applications as possible is insufficient
for the next highest ranking application, HUD shall determine (based upon the proposed activities) if it is feasible
to fund part of the application and offer a smaller grant to the applicant. If HUD determines that given the proposed
activities a smaller grant amount would make the activities infeasible, or if the applicant turns down the reduced
grant amount, HUD shall make the same determination for the next highest ranking application until all applications
within the competitive range have been exhausted or available funds have been expended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If HUD receives an insufficient number of applications to expend all funds, or if funds remain after HUD approves all
approvable applications, HUD may negotiate increased amounts of grant awards up to an additional $250,000. Increased
grants will be offered in rank order to applicants in the competitive range.

C. Geographic Distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD reserves the right to make selections out of rank order to provide for a geographic distribution of funded centers.
The geographic balance that HUD will use, if it decides to implement this option, will be based on a combination of two
adjacent standard Federal regions (e.g., Southwest and Southeast Regions, Great Plains and Midwest Regions, etc.)
If the rank order does not yield at least one fundable center within each two region combination, then HUD may select
the highest ranking application from such a combination, as long as the minimum score of 70 is achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is HUD's intent to fund at least one COPC that serves the colonias, as defined by section 916(d) of the Cranston-Gonzales
National Affordable Housing Act, as long as the applicant receives a minimum score of 70. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is HUD's intent to give preference to COPCs that serve Federally-designated empowerment zones or enterprise communities,
as long as the applicant receives a minimum score of 70.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined

political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or on the distribution
of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice is not subject to review
under the Order. Specifically, the notice solicits participation in an effort to provide assistance to institutions
of higher education for establishing and carrying out research and outreach activities addressing the problems
of urban areas. The Centers established under this notice will work with local communities to help resolve urban problems.
The notice does not impinge upon the relationships between the Federal government and State or local governments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815. (This is not a toll-free
number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. However, a HUD
employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with persons
outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters counsel for the
program to which the question pertains.

F. Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 13 was implemented by final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 17, 1991 (56 FR 22912). The final rule is codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence
the Department in these ways, they are urged to read part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the
regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions about the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 TDD: (202)
708&hyph;1112 These are not toll-free numbers. Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from
the local HUD office.

G. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of Section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal contracts, grants,
or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government
in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants,
cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying.
Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that
no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.
