<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Mediterranean fruit fly, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ceratitis capitata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Wiedemann), is one of the world's most destructive pests of numerous fruits and vegetables. The Mediterranean fruit
fly (Medfly) can cause serious economic losses. Heavy infestations can cause complete loss of crops, and losses of
25 to 50 percent are not uncommon. The short life cycle of this pest permits the rapid development of serious outbreaks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We established the Mediterranean fruit fly regulations (7 CFR 301.78 through 301.78&hyph;10; referred to below
as the regulations), and quarantined the Hancock Park area of Los Angeles County, CA, in an interim rule effective
on November 5, 1991, and published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 13, 1991 (56 FR 57573&hyph;57579, Docket No. 91&hyph;155). The regulations impose restrictions on the
interstate movement of regulated articles from quarantined areas in order to prevent the spread of the Medfly to noninfested
areas of the United States. We have published a series of interim rules amending these regulations by adding or removing
certain portions of Los Angeles, Santa Clara, Orange, San Bernardino, and San Diego Counties, CA, from the list of
quarantined areas. Amendments affecting California were made effective on September 10, and November 12, 1992;
and on January 19, July 16, August 3, September 22, October 14, November 23, and December 22, 1993 (57 FR 42485&hyph;42486,
Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;2; 57 FR 54166&hyph;54169, Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;3; 58 FR 6343&hyph;6346,

Docket No. 91&hyph;155&hyph;10). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent trapping surveys by inspectors of California State and county agencies and by inspectors of the Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have revealed that additional infestations of Medfly have been discovered
in the Wilmington area in Los Angeles County, CA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations in &sect;301.78&hyph;3 provide that the Administrator of APHIS will list as a quarantined area each
State, or each portion of a State, in which the Medfly has been found by an inspector, in which the Administrator has
reason to believe that the Medfly is present, or that the Administrator considers necessary to regulate because of
its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which the Medfly has been found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with these criteria and the recent Medfly findings described above, we are amending &sect;301.78&hyph;3
by expanding the area that extends through Los Angeles and Orange Counties with the addition of a Los Angeles County
area of approximately 101 square miles. The new quarantined area is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Los Angeles County 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That portion of Los Angeles County bounded by a line drawn as follows: Beginning at the intersection of State Highway
91 and Crenshaw Boulevard; then south along Crenshaw Boulevard to its intersection with North Palos Verdes Drive;
then east along North Palos Verdes Drive to its intersection with Palos Verdes Drive East; then south along Palos Verdes
Drive East to its intersection with 25th Street; then east along 25th Street to its intersection with Gaffey Street;
then north along Gaffey Street to its intersection with 22nd Street; then east along 22nd Street to its intersection
with Pacific Avenue; then south along Pacific Avenue to its intersection with Bluff Place; then south from this intersection
along an imaginary line to its intersection with the Pacific Ocean coastline; then east along the Pacific Ocean coastline
to its intersection with the San Pedro Breakwater; then east along the San Pedro Breakwater to the Los Angeles Harbor
Light Station; then east from the Los Angeles Harbor Light Station along an imaginary line to the Los Angeles Harbor
Entrance East Light; then northeast from the Los Angeles Harbor Entrance East Light along the Middle Breakwater to
the Long Beach Harbor Light Station; then north from the Long Beach Harbor Light Station along an imaginary line to
the intersection of Harbor Scenic Way and Harbor Scenic Drive; then northwest along Scenic Harbor Drive to its intersection
with Queen's Way; then north along Queen's Way to its intersection with Ocean Boulevard; then east along Ocean Boulevard
to its intersection with Alamitos Avenue; then northeast along Alamitos Avenue to its intersection with State Highway
1; then east along State Highway 1 to its intersection with Cherry Avenue; then north along Cherry Avenue to its intersection
with Willow Street; then east on Willow Street to its intersection with Lakewood Boulevard; then north on Lakewood
Boulevard to its intersection with Carson Street; then west on Carson Street to its intersection with Paramount Boulevard;
then north on Paramount Boulevard to its intersection with State Highway 91; then West on Highway 91 to the point of
beginning.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Emergency Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an emergency exists that
warrants publication of this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is necessary
to prevent the Mediterranean fruit fly from spreading to noninfested areas of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the
public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon signature.
We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the
comments.

Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule affects the interstate movement of regulated articles from the Wilmington area of Los Angeles County,
CA. There are approximately 223 small entities that could be affected, including 122 fruit sellers, 21 nurseries,
6 distributors, 7 growers, 50 vendors, 6 food banks, 1 farmers' market, and 10 swapmeets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These small entities comprise less than 1 percent of the total number of similar small entities operating in the State
of California. In addition, most of these small entities sell regulated articles primarily for local intrastate,
not interstate, movement, and the sale of these articles would not be affected by this interim regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the new quarantined area in Los Angeles County, the effect on those few small entities that do move regulated articles
interstate from parts of the quarantined areas will be minimized by the availability of various treatments that,
in most cases, will allow these small entities to move regulated articles interstate with very little additional
cost. Also, many of these entities sell other items in addition to the regulated articles so that the effect, if any,
of this regulation on these entities should be minimal. Further, the number of affected entities is small compared
with the thousands of small entities that move these articles interstate from nonquarantined areas in California
and other States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared for this rule. The assessment
provides a basis for our conclusion that implementation of integrated pest management to achieve eradication of
the Medfly would not have a significant impact on human health and the natural environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact were prepared in accordance with: (1) The National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 14, 1993, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued a proposed rule (58 FR 37876) with respect to the support
prices for shorn wool, wool on unshorn lambs, and mohair for the 1993 marketing year. The support level for wool on unshorn
lambs has been determined by taking 80 percent of the difference between the 1993 support price for shorn wool and the
1993 national average market price for shorn wool, multiplied by 5 pounds (the amount of wool on an average 100-pound
unshorn lamb). The mohair support level has been determined to be $4.738, which is equal to 85 percent of the comparable
percentage of parity at which shorn wool is supported for the 1993 marketing year. These actions are required by section
703 of the National Wool Act of 1954, as amended (Wool Act).

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule amends 7 CFR part 1468 to set forth determinations with respect to the support prices for shorn wool,
wool on unshorn lambs, and mohair for the 1993 marketing year. A general description of the statutory basis for such
determinations in this final rule was set forth at 58 FR 37876 (July 14, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A total of seven comments were received during the 30-day public comment period that ended August 13, 1993. Three respondents
recommended that no changes be made to current support rates. Three respondents recommended that the price support
programs be eliminated. In response to these 6 comments, it should be noted that although the proposed rule will be
adopted without change, the wool and mohair programs will cease to exist after December 31, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One respondent suggested that full payment for wool on unshorn lambs should be made only on unshorn lambs up to 125 pounds,
liveweight, and that no payments should be made on any weight exceeding 125 pounds. The respondent cited a problem
with the current payment method which prorates payments based on the amount of weight gained while the lamb is owned
first by the producer and later, a lamb feeder. The respondent noted that prorating payments encourages the production
of over-fat lambs_a product that is not wanted by the American consumer_resulting in low lamb prices to the detriment
of producers. This comment has not been adopted because it would increase recordkeeping requirements significantly
for both ASCS and program participants, and it would require ASCS to make major revisions to the current procedure
for calculating unshorn lamb payments. The potential savings resulting from lower payments would not be sufficient
to justify such an increase in the administrative burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering these comments, the following determinations have been made with respect to the wool and mohair
price support programs for the 1993 marketing year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 703 of the Wool Act, the support price for wool on unshorn lambs shall be determined by taking
80 percent of the difference between the 1993 support price for shorn wool and the 1993 national average market price
for shorn wool, multiplied by 5 pounds (the amount of wool pulled from the pelt of an average 100-pound unshorn lamb).

In accordance with section 703 of the Wool Act, the support price for mohair for the 1993 marketing year shall be $4.738,
which is equal to 85 percent of the comparable percentage of parity at which shorn wool is supported for the 1993 marketing
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The support programs conducted pursuant to the Wool Act are subject to the provisions of the Balanced Budget and Deficit
Reduction Act of 1985, as amended. As a result, the price support levels announced in this rule may be recalculated
to comply with this Act.

(b)(1) The shorn wool support price for the 1991 through 1995 marketing years shall be 77.5 percent of an amount which
is determined by multiplying 62 cents (the support price in 1965) by the ratio of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The average of the parity index (the index of prices paid by farmers, including commodities and services, interest,
taxes, and farm wage rates) for the three calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which such support
price is being determined and announced to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The average parity index for the three calendar years 1958, 1959, and 1960, rounding the result to the nearest
full cent. The shorn wool support price shall be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The payment rate for wool on unshorn lambs for the 1991 through 1995 marketing years shall be 80 percent of the difference
between the national average price received by producers for shorn wool during a specified marketing year and the
shorn wool support price multiplied by 5 (the average grease wool yield per hundredweight of live, unshorn lambs marketed).
The payment rate for wool on unshorn lambs shall be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) 1991_$5.32 per hundredweight.

(iii) 1993_an amount equal to 80 percent of the difference between the national average price received by producers
for shorn wool for the 1993 marketing year and the 1993 shorn wool support price, multiplied by 5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The mohair support price for the 1991 through 1995 marketing years shall be established at such level, in relationship
to the support price for shorn wool, which is determined necessary to maintain approximately the same percentage
of parity for mohair as for shorn wool. The mohair support price shall be set within a range of 15 per centum above or below
the comparable percentage of parity at which shorn wool is supported, as determined and announced by CCC. The support
price for mohair shall be as follows:

 We are declaring Belgium free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease. Rinderpest has not existed in Belgium since
1920 and there have been no outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease since 1976. This action removes the prohibition on
the importation from Belgium into the United States of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants,
and relieves restrictions on the importation from Belgium of milk and milk products from ruminants. This action does
not relieve restrictions on the importation from Belgium of swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from swine,
because Belgium has not been declared free of hog cholera and swine vesicular disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

We also are adding Belgium to a list of countries that, although declared free of rinderpest and foot-and-mouth disease,
are subject to restrictions on the importation of their meat and other animal products into the United States. Finally,
we also are adding Belgium to the list of countries from which the importation into the United States of llamas and alpacas
is restricted.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 94 (referred to below as ``the regulations'') govern the importation into the United
States of specified animals and animal products to prevent the introduction into the United States of various diseases,
including rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy, African swine fever,
hog cholera, and swine vesicular disease (SVD). These are dangerous and destructive communicable diseases of ruminants
and swine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 13, 1993, we published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 47834&hyph;47836, Docket No. 93&hyph;103&hyph;1) a proposal to amend the regulations by adding Belgium to
the list in &sect;94.1(a)(2) of countries that are declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments concerning our proposal for a 30-day period ending on October 13, 1993. During that period,
we received one comment from a national dairy association requesting that we reopen and extend the comment period
so that its members would have ample time to prepare and submit comments. In response, on October 28, 1993, we published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 57971&hyph;57972, Docket No. 93&hyph;103&hyph;2) a document reopening and extending the comment period
until November 29, 1993. We considered all comments received following the date of publication of the proposed rule
and on or before the new comment period closing date. We received only one comment by the new comment period closing
date, from a national dairy cattle breed association, which fully supported our proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as
a final rule without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a substantive rule that relieves restrictions and, pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, may be made effective
less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This rule removes the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from Belgium, of ruminants and fresh,
chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants and relieves restrictions on the importation, from Belgium, of milk and milk
products from ruminants. We have determined that approximately 2 weeks are needed to ensure that Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service personnel at ports of entry receive official notice of this change in the regulations.
Therefore, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this rule should
be made effective 15 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are adding Belgium to the list in part 94 of countries declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD. This action removes
the prohibition on the importation into the United States, from Belgium, of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen
meat from ruminants, and relieves restrictions on the importation, from Belgium, of milk and milk products from ruminants.
This action does not relieve restrictions on the importation of live swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of swine
from Belgium because Belgium is still considered to be affected with hog cholera and SVD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of ruminants and fresh,
chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants from Belgium into the United States as a result of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The value of total U.S. imports of cattle in 1991 was $951.6 million, and the value of total U.S. imports of sheep in 1991
was about $1.6 million. The United States did not import any cattle or sheep from Belgium during 1991. In fact, no cattle
or sheep were imported into the United States from any country in Western Europe during 1991 (USDA, Economic Research
Service (ERS), ``Foreign Agricultural Trade of the United States: Calendar Year 1991 Supplement,'' 1992). Western
Europe is not a source of ruminants for the United States; any increase in the import of ruminants from Belgium as a result
of this rule will have a negligible impact on existing trade patterns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, due to APHIS restrictions, the United States does not import uncooked meat or meat products from Belgium.
In 1991, total meat production in the United States (excluding pork) was just under 10.7 million metric tons, while
total meat production in Belgium (excluding pork) was 385,000 metric tons, less than four percent of United States
production. It is improbable that Belgium will begin to export any significant portion of its meat products to the
United States as a result of this rule. Therefore, we estimate that the effect of this rule on domestic meat prices or
supplies will be insignificant.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, we do not anticipate a major increase in exports of milk and milk products from Belgium into the United States
as a result of this rule. Importation into the United States of all dairy products, except for casein and other caseinates,
is restricted by quotas. Furthermore, while the United States imports more than half of the casein produced in the
world and the regulations allow casein and other caseinates to be imported from countries where rinderpest or FMD
exists (if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator), Belgium does not
currently export casein to the United States. Consequently, we believe that declaring Belgium free of rinderpest
and FMD will have no significant effect on the amount of casein imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect of declaring Belgium free of rinderpest and FMD on the trade in bovine embryos and semen will probably also
be minimal. The United States is a net exporter of bovine embryos and semen; in 1991, the value of bovine embryo and semen
exports totalled $46.5 million and $10.2 million, respectively, while imports amounted to only $2.7 million and
$89,000, respectively. Though similar trade data was not available for Belgium, we believe that due to the relatively
small size of the Belgium market, any increase in the export of bovine embryos and semen from Belgium will have a minimal
impact on the United States market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five United States importers, all of whom are considered small entities by Small Business Administration standards
(they have fewer than 100 employees), have expressed interest in importing bovine embryos and semen from Belgium.
APHIS expects the value of the anticipated imports to be minimal in comparison to the domestic production of these
entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') is amending Regulation 1.41 to revise the Commission's
requirements with respect to the number of copies of rule change proposals that an exchange must provide to the Commission.
The Commission also is adopting amendments that would revise certain of the procedures and standards set forth in
the Commission's expedited approval rules, Regulations 1.41(h) through 1.41(t), to reflect recent innovations
by the exchanges as well as miscellaneous amendments to the procedural aspects of the expedited approval rules. Other
proposed amendments include miscellaneous clarifying amendments to the Commission's Guideline No. 1.

Commission Regulation 1.41 sets forth procedures for submitting proposed exchange rules for Commission approval,
permitting certain exchange rules to go into effect without Commission approval, and dealing with exchange emergency
rules. All proposed exchange rules relating to the terms and conditions of a commodity futures or option contract
must, and any other rule may, be submitted for prior Commission approval, under Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act, pursuant
to procedures set forth in Regulation 1.41(b). Regulation 1.41(c) sets forth the submission requirements for rules
that do not relate to terms and conditions and which may be placed into effect without Commission approval ten days
after receipt by the Commission. Regulation 1.41(d) sets forth the submission requirements for rules that are exempt
from the requirements of Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act. Regulations 1.41(h) through (t) set forth conditions under
which, in lieu of submission under Regulation 1.41(b), certain types of exchange rule proposals relating to terms
and conditions requiring Commission approval may be deemed approved either upon adoption by the exchange or within
a specified number of days of Commission receipt, which ranges from one to ten days.

submission requirements of those regulations; (2) whether a rule submission submitted under Regulation 1.41(c)
or (d) relates to terms and conditions thus requiring prior Commission approval pursuant to the provisions of Regulation
1.41(b); (3) whether rules submitted under Regulation 1.41(c) do not require prior approval under Section 5a(a)(12)
of the Act and Regulation 1.41(b) and whether such rules may become effective prior to the expiration of the ten-day
period following receipt for such rules by the Commission; and (4) whether proposals submitted under any of the expedited
procedures of Regulations 1.41(h) through (t) comply with the applicable provisions of these regulations and, if
not, to notify the contract market that the submission is subject to the provisions of Regulation 1.41(b).

II. Amendments to Regulation 1.41 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is adopting amendments to Regulation 1.41 that would revise the requirements of Regulations 1.41(b),
1.41(c) and 1.41(h) through (t) to reduce to one from three the number of copies of rule change proposals that an exchange
must furnish to the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters for rule changes submitted under these regulations.
However, with respect to applications for contract market designation, under the amendments the exchanges would
continue to be required to submit three copies of the application, including the proposed rules, to the Commission
at its Washington, DC headquarters. Amendments to appendix A to part 5 of the Commission's regulations reflect this
continuing requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the Commission is eliminating the requirement that exchanges must submit one copy of rules submitted under
Regulations 1.41(d) and 1.41(h) through (t) to the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over
that exchange. The exchanges would continue to be required to submit one copy of rule proposals submitted under Commission
Regulations 1.41(b) and 1.41(c) to the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over that exchange.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has reviewed its procedures for processing rule submissions under Regulations 1.41(b), 1.41(c),
and 1.41(h) through (t), and, as a result of that review, the Commission has determined that the submission of more
than one copy of a rule change proposal to the Washington, DC headquarters is not necessary. Moreover, the Commission
has determined that, for rule change proposals submitted under Regulations 1.41(d) and 1.41(h) through (t), the
submission of a copy of such rule to the regional office of the Commission having local jurisdiction over that exchange
also is not necessary.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Further, these amendments would diminish the paperwork burden on the exchanges and would reduce costs associated
with filing submissions under these regulations.

These changes would not affect the current submission requirements under paragraph (f) of Regulation 1.41 regarding
temporary emergency rules, where the exchange is required to notify the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters
by the fastest available means of communication. A written copy of the emergency rule shall be furnished to the Commission
at its Washington, DC headquarters and two copies of the rule shall be furnished to the regional office of the Commission
having local jurisdiction over that exchange.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also is adopting amendments that would clarify and update the standards set forth in the expedited
approval procedures in paragraphs (h), (l), (o), (p), and (q) of Regulation 1.41. Paragraph (h) establishes an expedited
review procedure for changes to the composition, computation, or method of stock selection of a stock index in which
a contract market is designated to trade futures contracts, or options on such futures contracts. Currently, such
changes are deemed approved upon adoption by the contract market if: (i) The index is compiled for commercial purposes
by an independent third party; (ii) the change is consistent with a rule of the contract market which has been approved
by the Commission for this purpose which specifically defines, or establishes standards governing, the composition
of the stock index upon which the designated futures contracts are authorized to trade; (iii) the contract market
provides the Commission with written notice of the change within five days after the change is adopted by the contract
market; and (iv) the contract market labels the written notice as being submitted under Regulation 1.41(h). This
expedited procedure was established because routine changes to an index to maintain its continuity were not expected
to require detailed review by the Commission under paragraph (b) of Regulation 1.41. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on approximately 10 years of experience in administering the provisions of Regulation 1.41(h), the Commission
has determined that the submission to the Commission on a routine basis of changes which relate to maintaining the
continuity of a stock index is not necessary. Further, deleting this requirement would reduce the paperwork burden
on the exchanges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the amendment to Regulation 1.41(h) would delete items (iii) and (iv) above, so that a contract market
no longer would be required to submit routinely to the Commission a written notice of a change in the composition, computation,
or method of stock selection that is made to maintain the continuity of a stock index in which that contract market is
designated to trade futures or futures option contracts. In order for such a change to be deemed approved by the Commission
pursuant to Regulation 1.41(h) as amended, the index must continue to be compiled for commercial purposes by an independent
third party, and the change must be consistent with a rule of the contract market which has been approved by the Commission
for this purpose which defines, or establishes standards governing, the composition of the stock index. Under the
amended regulation, however, such changes would not routinely be required to be submitted to the Commission following
adoption by the exchange. As currently provided, contract markets would continue to be required to submit to the Commission
for review and approval under Regulation 1.41(b) all changes to the composition, computation, or method of stock
selection that are for purposes other than the continuity of the index. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, under amended Regulation 1.41(h), contract markets would be required to provide to the Commission, upon
special call to the contract market, information regarding the composition, computation, or method of stock selection
of the index, including any change or changes related to the continuity of the index, or any other issues relating to
the index, as instructed, and within the time, and for the period, specified in the call. Such a special call would provide
the Commission with information, as requested, to assure that the contract market continued to meet its regulatory
obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (l) of Regulation 1.41 establishes an expedited procedure for changes in trading months. Such changes
are deemed approved 10 days after the Commission receives written notification of the proposal, provided certain
conditions are satisfied. The amendment to paragraph (l) would clarify that this paragraph applies to exchange proposals
to delist contract months without open interest as well as to exchange proposals to list new months. In that regard,
the division directors or their delegees routinely process requests to delist contact months under Regulation 1.41(l),
as long as the months to be delisted have no open interest. The amendment simply clarifies the division directors'
delegated authority in this regard.

Paragraph (o) establishes an expedited procedure for changes in strike price listing procedures. Such changes are
deemed approved 10 days after the Commission receives written notification of the proposal, provided certain conditions
are satisfied. The amendment to paragraph (o) would clarify that this paragraph applies to exchange proposals to
amend strike price listing procedures for listed options without open interest, as well as for options not listed,
at the time the rule goes into effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (p) establishes an expedited procedure for changes in the last trading day of an option contract. Such changes
are deemed approved 10 days after the Commission receives written notification of the proposal, provided certain
conditions are satisfied. One amendment to paragraph (p) would clarify that this paragraph applies to listed options
without open interest, as well as to options not listed, at the time the rule goes into effect. Another amendment is
non-substantive and would correct a typographical error in section (3) of that paragraph. Specifically, the amendment
would clarify that the Commission will, within 10 days after receipt of a submission regarding a change in option last
trading day specifications, notify the contract market if the change appears to not be consistent with the provisions
of this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (q) of Regulation 1.41 provides that changes related to ``cabinet trade'' provisions for options may be
approved under expedited procedures. A cabinet trade currently is defined as an option trade that represents a closing
transaction for both parties to the trade and which is specifically identified as such in the contract market's rules.
The amendments to paragraph (q) revise the expedited approval standard to remove the requirement that option cabinet
trade rules eligible for treatment under this paragraph must involve closing transactions exclusively. This revision
in the expedited approval standard reflects recent innovations by the exchanges with respect to cabinet trade provisions.
An amendment to section (3) of that paragraph is non-substantive and corrects a typographical error. Specifically,
the amendment clarifies that the Commission will, within 10 days after receipt of a submission regarding a change
in the cabinet trade provisions of an option contract, notify the contract market if the change appears to not be consistent
with the provisions of this paragraph.

III. Amendments to Regulation 1.41a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In connection with the foregoing amendments to Regulation 1.41, the Commission is adopting amendments to paragraph
(a)(5) of Regulation 1.41a. Currently, as noted above, this regulation delegates to the Director of the Division
of Trading and Markets and to the Director of the Division of Economic Analysis, or their respective delegees, authority
to determine whether changes submitted under paragraphs (h)&hyph;(t) of Regulation 1.41 are inconsistent with
the relevant provisions of those paragraphs and to notify contract markets if such submissions are to be subject to
the usual review procedures under Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act and Regulation 1.41(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One amendment to Regulation 1.41a provides that the Director of the Division of Trading and Markets and the Director
of the Division of Economic Analysis, or their respective delegees, have the delegated authority to give notice that
rules submitted pursuant to &sect;&sect;1.41(k)&hyph;(t) comply with the provisions of &sect;&sect;1.41(k)&hyph;(t),
as applicable, and therefore shall be deemed approved prior to the end of the period specified in the applicable rule.
Such period commences on the day the rule is received by the Commission at its Washington, DC headquarters. The Commission
has received requests from exchanges for notice that rules submitted under the expedited procedures of &sect;&sect;1.41(k)&hyph;(t)
are deemed approved prior to the end of the specified period in order to provide for timely implementation of rules
to respond to rapidly changing market conditions or to avoid a market problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another amendment to Regulation 1.41a would expand the delegated authority of the Director of the Division of Trading
and Markets and the Director of the Division of Economic Analysis, or their respective delegees, to notify a contract
market that a rule submitted under Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act and &sect;1.41(b) will be treated as if submitted pursuant
to &sect;&sect;1.41(h)&hyph;(t), as applicable, if the rule submitted pursuant to the provisions of &sect;1.41(b)
complies with any of the provisions of &sect;&sect;1.41(h)&hyph;(t). Current procedures can delay processing
of the proposal and impede timely implementation of the rule.

IV. Amendments to Commission Guideline No. 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Guideline No. 1 sets forth the Commission's economic and public interest requirements for initial and continuing
designation of a contract market in a particular commodity. The Commission is proposing to revise this guideline
to correct an improper rule reference. Specifically, item 5 in column 2 of the ``Option Designation Checklist For
Options On Futures Contracts'' (option on futures checklist) and the ``Option Designation Checklist For Options
on Physicals'' (option on physicals checklist) regarding the option expiration criteria cites Commission Regulation
33.4(d)(1) as the applicable Commission regulation for these criteria. However, as a result of substantive revisions
to the Commission's option regulations adopted in September 1991 (56 FR 43694), many of the Commission's option regulations
were renumbered, including Regulation 33.4(d)(1) which was renumbered as 33.4(b)(2). Therefore, the Commission
hereby is amending the option checklists to replace 33.4(d)(1) with 33.4(b)(2) as the cited Commission regulation
for the option expiration criteria in each of those checklists.

 requires that agencies, in adopting rules, consider their impact on small businesses. The Commission has previously
determined that contract markets are not small entities for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 47 FR 18618
(April 30, 1982). Moreover, no additional regulatory burdens are imposed by these amendments. Therefore, the Acting
Chairman on behalf of the Commission hereby certifies, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that the action taken herein will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

C. Notice and Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), requires in most instances that a notice of proposed
rulemaking be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and that opportunity for comment be provided when an agency promulgates new regulations. Section 553(b) sets forth
an exception, however, for rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice. The instant amendments provide
expedited procedures for the approval of certain contract market rules. The Commission has determined that these
amendments, which will reduce the burden on the exchanges, relate to Commission procedure and practice and therefore
that notice and comment is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 553(b) also sets forth an exception to the requirement of notice and opportunity for public comment when the
Commission for good cause finds such notice and public comment are unnecessary or contrary to the public interest.
The Commission finds that notice and public comment on the rule changes announced herein are unnecessary because
the changes are procedural in nature and do not establish any new obligations under the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, all initial specifications of, and changes
to, option cabinet trade provisions shall be deemed approved by the Commission 10 days after written notice of such
change is received by the Commission if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The initial specification of a cabinet trade rule or a change thereto provides that the per-contract value (or
values) of the cabinet trade is (are) less than the per-contract value associated with a trade at the existing minimum
premium fluctuation specified in the contract market's rules for that option contract. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The contract market labels the written notice as being submitted pursuant to paragraph (q) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Commission will, within 10 days after receipt by the Commission of notice of a change in the cabinet trade provisions
of an option contract, notify the contract market making the submission if it appears that the change is not consistent
with the provisions of this paragraph. Upon such notification by the Commission to the contract market, the change
will be subject to the usual procedures under section 5a(a)(12) of the Act and paragraph (b) of this section.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 29, 1993, Customs published a decision in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 68743) concerning the country of origin marking requirements for imported frozen produce. The decision implemented
a new Customs interpretation of section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1304). Under the decision,
packages of imported frozen produce will be required to be marked with their country of origin on the front side of the
packaging in specified types and styles. However, the decision's section entitled: ``Previous Decisions Affected''
should have made clear that HQ 735085 (June 4, 1993) was being modified accordingly. This section on page 68747, second
column, is corrected to read, in its entirety, as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Previous Decisions Affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HRL 731830 (November 21, 1988), is revoked. HQ 735085 (June 4, 1993), and a related determination, HRL 735222 (June
28, 1993), are modified such that the rendering of the required marking shall be in accordance with this decision.
T.D. 91&hyph;48 (May 28, 1991), is modified. Conspicuous marking within the meaning of T.D. 91&hyph;48 shall be limited
to marking which complies with the specifications set forth in this decision.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) are financed by an employment tax imposed under the Railroad Retirement
Tax Act (RRTA) upon wages paid by railroad employers. The tax has two components, a tier I level and a tier II level. The
tier I level is the same as the tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and is used to finance what
are the equivalent of social security benefits payable under the RRA. The amount of compensation subject to tax is
based upon the contribution and benefit base as defined in section 230 of the Social Security Act (see 26 U.S.C. 3231(e)(2)(B)).
The contribution base generally rises each year to reflect increases in the national wage rate. In order to estimate
future revenues the Board has required employers to report gross earnings, up to $300,000, of a one-percent sample
of their employees (20 CFR 209.12). However, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 eliminated the wage cap
base for the Hospital Insurance Program (Medicare) portion of the tier I tax. Consequently, the $300,000 cap is no
longer adequate for making computations with respect to the financial interchange between the railroad retirement
and social security/medicare trust funds. Railroad retirement beneficiaries are covered under Medicare by virtue
of section 7(d) of the RRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consequently, the Board is amending its regulations to require employers to report gross wages, not just wages up
to $300,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for the amendment increasing the amount of reportable earnings to be effective with respect to the 1993 reports,
due by March 1, 1994, the Board is publishing this rule as an interim final rule. However, the Board does invite comments
on the change.

 In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 17, 1992 (57 FR 9260), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 2B4315) had been filed by Arakawa Chemical
Industries, Ltd., c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite 500 West, Washington, DC 20001. The petition proposed that &sect;176.170

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Components of paper and paperboard in contact with aqueous and fatty foods
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 176.170) be amended to provide for the safe use of hydrogenated aromatic petroleum hydrocarbon resin in coatings
on paper and paperboard in contact with fatty foods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed expanded use of
the additive is safe. The agency further concludes that &sect;176.170 should be amended as set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied
upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h),
the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making
the documents available for inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the
action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is
not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained
in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before February 14, 1994, file with
the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered,
and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection
is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically
so state. Failure to request a hearing for any particular objection shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing
on that objection. Each numbered objection for which a hearing is requested shall include a detailed description
and analysis of the specific factual information intended to be presented in support of the objection in the event
that a hearing is held. Failure to include such a description and analysis for any particular objection shall constitute
a waiver of the right to a hearing on the objection. Three copies of all documents shall be submitted and shall be identified
with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Any objections received in response to the
regulation may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On June 18, 1992, Jay W. Bagley, Administrator, Utah Occupational Safety and Health Division, submitted a plan change
supplement concerning Utah's Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP). After Federal review of the Utah VPP and subsequent
modifications made by the State, Utah's program was found to be generally identical to the Federal Voluntary Protection,
as described in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 30, 1993, Cathy Neville, Assistant Director, Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health, submitted
a plan change supplement concerning Arizona's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP). After Federal review of the Arizona
VPP, Arizona's program was found to be generally identical to the Federal Voluntary Protection Programs, with the
exception that the State's VPP is limited to the Star Program in general industry, excludes the Merit and Demonstration
Programs and excludes the construction industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 10, 1993, Yazminnie Vazquez, Director, Voluntary Program, Puerto Rico submitted a plan change supplement
concerning Puerto Rico's Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP). The Puerto Rico program also was found to be generally
identical to the Federal VPP with the exception of changes to reflect different structure and exclusion of the Demonstration
Program.

D. Public Participation

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c) of this chapter, the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite
the review process or for any other good cause which may be consistent with applicable law. The Assistant Secretary
finds that Utah's, Arizona's and Puerto Rico's Voluntary Protection Programs are generally identical to the Federal
Voluntary Protection Programs, meet Federal requirements and were adopted by the States in accordance with State
procedural requirements. Good cause is therefore found for approval of these supplements and further public participation
would be unnecessary.

This document notifies the public of the interest rate applicable to late premium payments and employer liability
underpayments and overpayments for the calendar quarter beginning January 1, 1994. This interest rate is established
quarterly by the Internal Revenue Service. This document also sets forth the interest rates for valuing unfunded
vested benefits for premium purposes for plan years beginning in November 1993 through January 1994. These interest
rates are established pursuant to section 4006 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.
The effect of these amendments is to advise plan sponsors and pension practitioners of these new interest rates.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA''), the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') collects premiums from ongoing plans to support the single-employer and multiemployer
insurance programs. Under the single-employer program, the PBGC also collects employer liability from those persons
described in ERISA section 4062(a). Under ERISA section 4007 and 29 CFR 2610.7, the interest rate to be charged on unpaid
premiums is the rate established under section 6601 of the Internal Revenue Code (``Code''). Similarly, under 29
CFR 2622.7, the interest rate to be credited or charged with respect to overpayments or underpayments of employer
liability is the section 6601 rate. These interest rates are published by the PBGC in appendix A to the premium regulation
and appendix A to the employer liability regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Internal Revenue Service has announced that for the quarter beginning January 1, 1994, the interest charged on
the underpayment of taxes will be at a rate of 7 percent. Accordingly, the PBGC is amending appendix A to 29 CFR part 2610
and appendix A to 29 CFR part 2622 to set forth this rate for the January 1, 1994, through March 31, 1994, quarter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii)(II), in determining a single-employer plan's unfunded vested benefits
for premium computation purposes, plans must use an interest rate equal to 80% of the annual yield on 30-year Treasury
securities for the month preceding the beginning of the plan year for which premiums are being paid. Under &sect;2610.23(b)(1)
of the premium regulation, this value is determined by reference to 30-year Treasury constant maturities as reported
in Federal Reserve Statistical Releases G.13 and H.15. The PBGC publishes these rates in appendix B to the regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PBGC publishes these monthly interest rates in appendix B on a quarterly basis to coincide with the publication
of the late payment interest rate set forth in appendix A. (The PBGC publishes the appendix A rates every quarter, regardless
of whether the rate has changed.) Unlike the appendix A rate, which is determined prospectively, the appendix B rate
is not known until a short time after the first of the month for which it applies. Accordingly, the PBGC is hereby amending
appendix B to part 2610 to add the vested benefits valuation rates for plan years beginning in November 1993 through
January 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The appendices to 29 CFR parts 2610 and 2622 do not prescribe the interest rates under these regulations. Under both
regulations, the appendix A rates are the rates determined under section 6601(a) of the Code. The interest rates in
appendix B to part 2610 are prescribed by ERISA section 4006(a)(3)(E)(iii)(II) and &sect;2610.23(b)(1) of the regulation.
These appendices merely collect and republish the interest rates in a convenient place. Thus, the interest rates
in the appendices are informational only. Accordingly, the PBGC finds that notice of and public comment on these amendments
would be unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. For the above reasons, the PBGC also believes that good cause
exists for making these amendments effective immediately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PBGC has determined that none of these actions is a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth
in Executive Order 12866, because they will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order
12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because no general notice of proposed rulemaking is required for these amendments, the Regulatory Flexibility Act
of 1980 does not apply. See 5 U.S.C. 601(2).

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule amends the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's (``PBGC's'') regulations on Valuation of Plan
Benefits in Single-Employer Plans (29 CFR part 2619) and Valuation of Plan Benefits and Plan Assets Following Mass
Withdrawal (29 CFR part 2676). Part 2619 contains the interest assumptions that the PBGC uses to value benefits under
terminating single-employer plans. Part 2676 contains the interest assumptions for valuations of multiemployer
plans that have undergone mass withdrawal. The amendments set out in this final rule adopt the interest assumptions
applicable to single-employer plans with termination dates in February 1994, and to multiemployer plans with valuation
dates in February 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This rule adopts the February 1994 interest assumptions to be used under the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's
(``PBGC's'') regulations on Valuation of Plan Benefits in Single-Employer Plans (29 CFR part 2619, the ``single-employer
regulation'') and Valuation of Plan Benefits and Plan Assets Following Mass Withdrawal (29 CFR part 2676, the ``multiemployer
regulation'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 2619 sets forth the methods for valuing plan benefits of terminating single-employer plans covered under title
IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA''). Under ERISA section 4041(c), all
single-employer plans wishing to terminate in a distress termination must value guaranteed benefits and ``benefit
liabilities'', i.e., all benefits provided under the plan as of the plan termination date, using the formulas set
forth in part 2619, subpart C. (Plans terminating in a standard termination may, for purposes of the Standard Termination
Notice filed with PBGC, use these formulas to value benefit liabilities, although this is not required.) In addition,
when the PBGC terminates an underfunded plan involuntarily pursuant to ERISA section 4042(a), it uses the subpart
C formulas to determine the amount of the plan's underfunding. Part 2676 prescribes rules for valuing benefits and
certain assets of multiemployer plans under sections 4219(c)(1)(D) and 4281(b) of ERISA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B to part 2619 sets forth the interest rates and factors under the single-employer regulation. Appendix
B to part 2676 sets forth the interest rates and factors under the multiemployer regulation. Because these rates and
factors are intended to reflect current conditions in the financial and annuity markets, it is necessary to update
the rates and factors periodically.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PBGC issues two sets of interest rates and factors, one set to be used for the valuation of benefits to be paid as annuities
and one set for the valuation of benefits to be paid as lump sums. The same assumptions apply to terminating single-employer
plans and to multiemployer plans that have undergone a mass withdrawal. This amendment adds to appendix B to parts
2619 and 2676 sets of interest rates and factors for valuing benefits in single-employer plans that have termination
dates during February 1994 and multiemployer plans that have undergone mass withdrawal and have valuation dates
during February 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For annuity benefits, the interest rates will be 5.90% for the first 25 years following the valuation date and 5.25%
thereafter. For benefits to be paid as lump sums, the interest assumptions to be used by the PBGC will be 4.50% for the
period during which benefits are in pay status and 4.0% during the period preceding the benefit's placement in pay
status. (ERISA section 205(g) and Internal Revenue Code section 417(e) provide that private sector plans valuing
lump sums under $25,000 must use interest assumptions at least as generous as those used by the PBGC for valuing lump
sums (and for lump sums exceeding $25,000 are restricted to 120% of the PBGC interest assumptions).) These annuity
and lump sum interest assumptions are unchanged from the January 1994 interest assumptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, the interest rates and factors under these regulations are in effect for at least one month. However, the
PBGC publishes its interest assumptions each month regardless of whether they represent a change from the previous
month's assumptions. The assumptions normally will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by the 15th of the preceding month or as close to the date as circumstances permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PBGC has determined that notice and public comment on these amendments are impracticable and contrary to the public
interest. This finding is based on the need to determine and issue new interest rates and factors promptly so that the
rates and factors can reflect, as accurately as possible, current market conditions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the need to provide immediate guidance for the valuation of benefits in single-employer plans whose termination
dates fall during February 1994, and in multiemployer plans that have undergone mass withdrawal and have valuation
dates during February 1994, the PBGC finds that good cause exists for making the rates and factors set forth in this
amendment effective less than 30 days after publication.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in
Executive Order 12866, because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order
12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because no general notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this amendment, the Regulatory Flexibility Act
of 1980 does not apply. See 5 U.S.C. 601(2).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under section 4219(c) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA''), the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``the PBGC'') promulgated a final regulation on Notice and Collection of Withdrawal
Liability. That regulation, codified at 29 CFR part 2644, deals with the rate of interest to be charged by multiemployer
pension plans on withdrawal liability payments that are overdue or in default, or to be credited by plans on overpayments
of withdrawal liability. The regulation allows plans to set rates, subject to certain restrictions. Where a plan
does not set the interest rate, &sect;2644.3(b) of the regulation provides that the rate to be charged or credited
for any calendar quarter is the average quoted prime rate on short-term commercial loans for the fifteenth day (or
the next business day if the fifteenth day is not a business day) of the month preceding the beginning of the quarter,
as reported by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Statistical Release H.15 (``Selected Interest
Rates'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the regulation incorporates interest rates published in Statistical Release H.15, that release is the authoritative
source for the rates that are to be applied under the regulation. As a convenience to persons using the regulation,
however, the PBGC collects the applicable rates and republishes them in an appendix to part 2644. This amendment adds
to this appendix the interest rate of 6 percent, which will be effective from January 1, 1994 through March 31, 1994.
This rate represents no change from the rate in effect for the fourth quarter of 1993. This rate is based on the prime
rate in effect on December 15, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The appendix to 29 CFR part 2644 does not prescribe interest rates under the regulation; the rates prescribed in the
regulation are those published in Statistical Release H.15. The appendix merely collects and republishes the rates
in a convenient place. Thus, the interest rates in the appendix are informational only. Accordingly, the PBGC finds
that notice of and public comment on this amendment would be unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. For the
above reasons, the PBGC also believes that good cause exists for making this amendment effective immediately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in
Executive Order 12866, because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 19, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior approved Oklahoma's program under the Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) (see 46 FR 4902). On November 12, 1993, OSM notified the Governor of Oklahoma that it
had reason to believe that serious problems exist that are adversely affecting the effective implementation, administration,
maintenance and enforcement of Oklahoma's approved regulatory program (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->

below).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of OSM's regulations at 30 CFR 733.12(c), OSM will hold an informal conference to discuss the
facts surrounding such a notification if an informal conference is requested by the State. By letter dated December
22, 1993, the Oklahoma Department of Mines (ODM) requested an informal conference. Accordingly, OSM hereby notifies
Oklahoma and the public that it will hold an informal conference. All interested persons may attend the informal conference.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 19, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Oklahoma program (46 FR 4902&hyph;4911).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 12, 1993, OSM notified the Governor of Oklahoma that it had reason to believe that serious problems exist
that are adversely affecting the effective implementation, administration, maintenance, and enforcement of Oklahoma's
approved permanent regulatory program under SMCRA (OK&hyph;945).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the approval of Oklahoma's program, and in keeping with its policy of working closely with the State, OSM has
had numerous discussions with ODM officials about the State's performance. Recent discussions and investigations
have centered on inadequacies of ODM's implementation of the approved program in the areas set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Citing Violations:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ODM has not cited all violations as the State program requires.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Unreasonable Extensions of Abatement of Violations:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Failure to abate cessation orders have not been issued in cases where such would have been appropriate. Instead, ODM
has repeatedly extended abatement periods of violations. Contrary to the approved program, ODM has routinely extended
the period for abatement of violations cited in NOV's beyond 90 days without compelling reasons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Civil Penalty Reductions:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After appropriate initial assessments, ODM has frequently reduced penalties without appropriate justification
when those penalties were challenged in assessment conferences and settlement agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicant Violator System Not Updated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ODM has not properly updated the applicant violator system, which negates the use of the system to block approval of
permits and revisions for entities that have outstanding violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reclamation and Bonding Failure:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ODM has allowed mine operators to create a disturbed area that is larger than the acreage specified in the approved
mine plan, thereby leading to inadequate bond.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Permit Defects:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ODM has approved permits and permit revisions that allow practices that do not comply with the Oklahoma program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Failure to Enact Program Amendments:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Oklahoma has failed to promulgate rules approved in amendments to the Oklahoma program that were required for the
program to be no less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Inadequate Allowance for Public Participation:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ODM has not maintained or made available inspection and enforcement files in the county of the mining as required by
the State program. ODM has not thoroughly investigated and acted on citizen's comments on permitting actions. ODM
discouraged public participation through an improper decision that awarded attorney's fees to a mine operator.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the November 12, 1993, notification, OSM specified a date for ODM to present a plan to correct the deficiencies in
the implementation of its program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 733.12(c) of 30 CFR requires OSM to provide the State regulatory authority an opportunity for an informal
conference. On December 22, 1993, the Chief Counsel of ODM requested that OSM hold such an informal conference. (OK&hyph;945.02)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The informal conference may pertain to the facts of the deficiencies or the time period for accomplishing remedial
actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conference Rules: The informal conference is an opportunity for OSM to discuss the status of the implementation of
Oklahoma's program with Oklahoma officials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No testimony from the public will be taken but a verbatim transcript of the meeting will be kept.

This order partially revokes a Secretarial order insofar as it affects 35 acres of public lands withdrawn for the Bureau
of Reclamation's Yellowstone Project. The lands are no longer needed for reclamation purposes, and the revocation
is needed to permit disposal of the lands through competitive sale under section 203 of the Federal Land Policy and
Management Act of 1976. This action will open the land to surface entry. The minerals are held in trust for the Crow Tribe
by the United States under the Act of August 14, 1958 (Pub. L. 85&hyph;628, 72 Stat. 575). The lands have been and remain
open to mineral leasing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to a petition for reconsideration filed by NorMin Broadcasting Company, this document rescinds the allotment
of Channel 234C3 at Staples, Minnesota. The Report and Order in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;219 allotted Channel 234C3 to
Staples, Minnesota, and modified the construction permit for Station KSKK(FM), Channel 234A, to specify operation
on Channel 234C3. See 58 FR 59375 (1993). NorMin Broadcasting Company has filed an application seeking to take advantage
of the Commission's new Rules permitting an upgrade in facilities by the application process rather than the rule
making process (BMPH&hyph;931102IE). See FM Channel and Class Modifications by Application, 58 FR 38534, July 19,
1993. With this action, this proceeding is terminated.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ``Negotiated Rates Act of 1993'' amends the Interstate Commerce Act by adding section 10767. Section 10767 requires
that the Commission establish regulations to prohibit, except for certain services, motor common and contract carriers
of property from providing a reduction in a tariff rate or contract rate to a person who is a nonpayer of freight charges.
This proceeding establishes, as set forth below, the regulations required by the statute.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 By a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) in Ex Parte No. MC&hyph;180 (Sub-No. 2), Rulemaking_Payment of Discounts
by Motor Carriers of Property to the Nonpayer of Freight Charges (not printed) served June 4, 1993 (58 FR 32340, June
9, 1993), the Commission instituted a proceeding to determine whether off-bill discounting where it does or may result
in a misrepresentation of shipping charges should be found to be an unreasonable practice or otherwise unlawful.
However, the ``Negotiated Rates Act of 1993'' (Pub. L. 103&hyph;180) since has been enacted and amends subchapter
IV of chapter 107 of title 49, United States Code, by adding section 10767, which requires that the Commission issue
regulations by April 2, 1994, that will:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prohibit, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
except as described in (4) below, motor common and contract carriers of property from providing a reduction in a tariff
or contract rate to any party other than the person directly responsible to the carrier for payment of the transportation
service according to the bill of lading, receipt, or contract, or an agent of the person paying for the transportation.
49 U.S.C. 10767(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Require 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a motor common carrier of property to disclose, either by a shipping document or an electronic transmission, the actual
tariff rate, charge, or allowance to the person directly responsible for payment for the transportation service.
49 U.S.C. 10767(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prohibit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
any person from causing a motor common carrier of property to present a document to any party of the transaction, which
contains false or misleading information about the actual tariff rate, charge, or allowance. 49 U.S.C. 10767(b).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Permit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
motor common and contract carriers of property to make actual tariff or contract payments or allowances to a party
to the transaction, when such party performs a transportation service that would otherwise be performed by the carrier,
such as a loading and unloading service, provided that the payment or allowance is reasonably related to the cost that
such party knows or has reason to know would otherwise be incurred by the motor carrier if it had performed the service.
49 U.S.C. 10767(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because section 10767 supersedes the NPR, the Ex Parte No. MC&hyph;180 (Sub-No. 2) proceeding is discontinued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission does not believe this revision requires notice and comment rulemaking under section 553 of the Administrative

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is adopting modifications to the Annual Performance Report, Form OCP&hyph;101 (OCP&hyph;101),
which sets forth requirements that relate to carrier performance information given to prospective individual shippers
of household goods. This proceeding was instituted to address concerns expressed by consumer groups and the moving
industry regarding the quality and reliability of the information provided by household goods carriers in the OCP&hyph;101.
The modified OCP&hyph;101 requires objective disclosure by carriers of their performance to prospective shippers
and verification of accuracy of the data contained in the reports.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Currently, the Commission's rules require household goods common carriers that transport 100 or more shipments
to individual shippers, as defined in the Commission's rules, to provide information annually to the Commission
about their previous year's performance by filing an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Annual Performance Report 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(Form OCP&hyph;101). Under the new rules adopted in this decision, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
all 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
household goods common carriers will be required to file the OCP&hyph;101 annually. However, only carriers that
deliver 100 or more individual C.O.D. shipments will be required to complete the major portion of the form (Part B)
and provide copies of it to prospective shippers. Part B of the OCP&hyph;101 shows a carrier's performance in the areas
of estimating, on-time performance, and claims handling in a calendar year for C.O.D. shippers only. The OCP&hyph;101
must be filed with the Commission's Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance by March 31 of the following calendar
year.

Energy and Environmental Consideration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We conclude that modification of the regulations governing Form OCP&hyph;101 will not significantly affect either
the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we conclude that our action in this proceeding will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. We are modifying the OCP&hyph;101 requirements that relate to a carrier's
performance information given to prospective individual shippers of household goods by motor common carriers of
household goods transporting 100 or more C.O.D. individual-type shipments. The modified form will require verification
of the data in the report by a company official. The regulations will have some impact on the administrative costs of
preparing and duplicating the OCP&hyph;101 for smaller carriers (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Class II and III carriers) of household goods. The information required for completing that form is the type of information
already kept by such entities and the time required to compile the data for that form should be minimal and vary proportionately
with the number of shipments transported by the carrier. Although transportation consumers should benefit from
the availability of this information, the cost to small carriers should be relatively minimal. Accordingly, it is
unlikely that the economic impact on these small entities will be significant within the meaning of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act.

General Instructions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Data for completion of Form OCP&hyph;101 may be obtained by random sampling providing that in every instance, the
universe sampled is all shipments delivered under your common carrier authority (excluding Government, Freight
forwarder, and Interline traffic) during the report year or all claims arising out of the transportation of those
shipments that were received or settled, as appropriate, during the report year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. When random sampling is used, the minimum sample size in every instance shall be 400 shipments or claims, as appropriate,
in replicates of 100 shipments or claims each. All samples must conform to standard deviation with a 95% confidence
level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Carriers submitting Form OCP&hyph;101 shall retain and make available for review by an authorized Commission
employee all working papers, notes, and other files relating to the preparation of each report for a period of not less
than 24 months following the date of filing such a report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The data in Form OCP&hyph;101 must be verified by a sworn statement signed by an official of the company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Specific Instructions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Part A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
Line 1: Only report those 1st proviso C.O.D. shipments moved under your common carrier authority after excluding
all Government, Freight forwarder and Interline traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Line 2: Report all other 1st proviso shipments, including those moving under contract carriage provisions and all
Government, Freight forwarder and Interline traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Line 3: Sum lines 1 and 2. The total should agree with total 1st proviso shipments reported in your ICC Annual Report,
Schedule 600, Line 7, Column d, if you are required to file that report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Part B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not necessary to complete Part B if the total of C.O.D. shipments reported on Part A, Line 1, did not equal or exceed
100 shipments. If completion of Part B is not required, sign the Certification and return the form to the Interstate
Commerce Commission. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
Line 4: Report only those C.O.D. shipments where the order for service was signed after the receipt of a written binding
estimate. Include in this computation all so-called hybrid estimates (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
 Guaranteed Price and Price Protection options). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Line 5: Report the total number of C.O.D. shipments where the order for service was signed after the receipt of a written
non-binding estimate. In the case of non-binding estimates, the actual charges are determined after the shipment
has been picked up and weighed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Line 6: Report only those C.O.D. shipments where there was no requirement for the preparation of a binding or non-binding
written estimate by the carrier. As with non-binding estimates, the charges here are determined after the shipment
has been picked up and weighed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Line 7: Sum of Lines 4, 5, and 6. The number of shipments reported on Line 7 should be the same as those reported in Part
A, Line 1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Computation of Percentages or Averages
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
You must determine the number of shipments falling into each of the categories described in Lines 8 and 9, respectively,
and divide these shipments by the number of shipments reported on Lines 4 and 5, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You must determine the number of shipments falling into each of the categories described in Lines 10 through 16 and
divide these shipments by the number of shipments reported on Line 7. (Exception: Line 13 is an average, not a percentage.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
Line 8: Compute the percentage of those shipments delivered where the final charges exceeded the written estimate
initially provided to the shipper because of changes agreed to by the carrier and shipper in commodities transported
and services provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Line 9: Compute the percentage of those shipments delivered under a non-binding written estimate where the final
charges exceeded the written estimate provided to the shipper by 10% or more. The 10% figure is used because every C.O.D.
shipper is required to have available 110% of the estimate at the time of delivery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Line 10: Compute the percentage of those shipments where the actual pickup date occurred after the last date for pickup
promised on the order for service or bill of lading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Line 11: Compute the percentage of those shipments where the actual delivery date occurred after the last date for
delivery promised on the order for service or bill of lading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Line 12: Compute the percentage of those shipments where there was a claim filed within 60 days of the actual date of
delivery to the residence. Only count those claims where the dollar value of the amount claimed by the shipper exceeded
$200 and resulted from property damaged or lost. This excludes claims for late pickups and deliveries which are reported
on line 13. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Line 13: Compute the percentage of those shipments where there was a claim filed within 60 days of the actual date of
delivery to the residence. Only count those claims where the dollar value of the amount claimed by the shipper exceeded
$200 and resulted from a late pickup or delivery. Late pickups and deliveries are defined in Instructions 10 and 11.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Line 14: Enter the average number of days required to pay, decline, or make a firm compromise offer of settlement of
all claims exceeding $200 during the report year. For the purpose of this report, a claim shall be considered to be a
``claim filed'' if it meets the criteria set forth in Lines 11 and 12, and shall be considered as paid, declined, or compromised
on the date on which a written offer is mailed or delivered in person to a claimant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Line 15: Compute the percentage of the claims exceeding $200 arising out of the transportation of shipments which
were resolved during the report year through the use of a dispute resolution or arbitration procedure maintained
or participated in by the carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Line 16: Compute the percentage of the claims exceeding $200 arising out of the transportation of shipments which
were resolved during the report year as a result of legal notice of suit to recover being filed by the shipper.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD is amending the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety Standards (FMHCSS) to improve the resistance of manufactured homes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wind forces in areas prone to hurricanes. Under this rule, manufactured homes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will have to be designed to withstand wind speeds of up to 110 miles an hour 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in hurricane-prone areas, in accordance with design provisions of the American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Society of Civil Engineers Standard ANSI/ASCE 7&hyph;88. Also, the Department is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making certain other changes to the standards to ensure that structural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies, components, windows, connectors, and fasteners will be adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the area in which the home is to be placed. The revised standard also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires exterior roof and wall coverings to be fastened adequately to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sheathing and framing members, to resist higher design wind pressures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this rule is to increase the safety of manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
homes, thereby reducing deaths and injuries and extensive property damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses in areas where wind-induced damage is a particular hazard and risk.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5401&hyph;5426, at 5401) (the Act) is to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of personal injuries and deaths and the amount of insurance costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and property damage resulting from manufactured home accidents, and to improve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the quality and durability of manufactured homes. Section 604 of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confers authority on the Secretary of HUD to issue, amend, or revoke any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal manufactured home construction or safety standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following Hurricane Andrew, the Department conducted field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigations of the damage experienced in the hurricane by manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing units, as part of a full-scale review of the Federal manufactured home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. The goal of these investigations and the review of materials and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations was to ensure that the Federal standards provide adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection to manufactured home occupants during high wind conditions. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 14, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule (58 FR 19536) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported the preliminary conclusions of the Department's efforts, and sought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment on changes that the Department was considering for the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. The Department also contacted each of the members of the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufactured Home Advisory Council (Advisory Council), individually, in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to solicit their individual comments on the proposed wind standards rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the proposed timetable for final publication did not permit convening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Advisory Council. The individual responses of the Advisory Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members have been considered as public comments and included in the docket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
file for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 9, 1993, the Department announced (58 FR 32316) that the comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period would be extended to July 9, 1993. The Department has continued to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive and consider comments well after that date, while this final rule was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being developed. Because the timeframe originally proposed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of standard changes was postponed as a result of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments and the extension of the comment deadline, the Department consulted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the National Manufactured Home Commission and convened the Advisory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council for consultation and to seek recommendations from the Advisory Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a whole (see the notice published at 58 FR 34586 (June 28, 1993)). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Council met in Washington, DC, on July 13 and 14, 1993, to discuss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wind standards and other proposals for changes to the standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured housing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The recommendations of the Advisory Council as a whole were included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a resolution. The resolution questioned the sufficiency of the evidence to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support adoption of the proposed rule and recommended that: (1) The Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undertake negotiated rulemaking or other comparable process for this standard; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the costs of any rule be considered, both cumulatively and by zones; (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department examine its legal and regulatory authority with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation, if it finds that an installation standard would be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate means of increasing wind safety; (4) the Department consider all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nationally recognized model codes; (5) the Department make available documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to the development of new wind standards; (6) the Advisory Council be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconvened to review public comments and the Department's analysis; (7) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department should promptly complete the process of updating the wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, considering the issues and questions raised by the Advisory Council 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in public comments; and (8) the Department should prepare an adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory impact analysis upon which it can support the decisions to be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on implementation of new standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered the conclusions and recommendations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Council in developing this final rule and the final regulatory impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. The regulatory impact analysis is responsive to several of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Council's concerns, while this preamble addresses other points raised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Advisory Council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the other points raised by the Advisory Council, many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters also suggested that installation is a crucial factor in the safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of manufactured homes. The Department agrees that the installation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured housing units may be an important factor in the safety of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing and is initiating a review of the Department's authority and ability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to influence tiedown requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Department does not believe there is any significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantage in, or that the public interest would be served by, reconvening the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Advisory Council for the purpose of reviewing the public comments or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department's compliance with its statutory responsibilities in the development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these standards. Nor does the Department believe there is any advantage to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public interest in undertaking negotiated rulemaking for these standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because they have been subject to an extensive notice and comment period and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been discussed with the Advisory Council, a body representative of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured housing industry, government, and consumers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Major Differences From Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the Department's review of public comments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation with the Advisory Council, at this time the Department has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided not to pursue substantial changes to the standards in areas of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country not generally subject to hurricanes (Wind Zone I). However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department recognizes that in many areas of the country the Federal standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to the design and construction of manufactured housing are far 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below standards specified for site-built and modular housing by State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local codes. Thus, the Department shall initiate a new review of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for the rest of the country, and it expects to publish proposals for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these areas next year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has also decided not to include in the final rule the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following items that were in the proposed rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Maximum dimension of 12
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; for roof overhangs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Lower load duration factor than provided in the 1991 National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Design Specification for Wood Construction (NDS); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Requirement for a 1.5 safety factor to calculate resistance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anchoring and foundation systems to higher design forces in Wind Zones II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and III; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Manufacturer's design and details for a permanent foundation system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(certified by a registered professional engineer or architect) applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each manufactured home design; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Shortened period for implementation of the standards after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Relationship to Energy Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 25, 1993, the Department published a final rule amending the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include preemptive standards significantly upgrading the existing energy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation requirements (58 FR 54975) (Energy Rule). The effective date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that rule is October 25, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several of the provisions to be affected by the Energy Rule are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by the rule published today. Because of the earlier effective date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for those provisions in today's rule, the Department will publish technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendments to the Energy Rule, before the effective date of that rule, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also will reflect the new requirements imposed under today's rule. In some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minor instances, the changes adopted in today's rule already include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that otherwise would have been imposed upon the effective date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Energy Rule. Those changes are identified further in the section-by- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section analysis later in this preamble.

Problem To Be Addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each year significant damage to manufactured housing is produced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
straight winds, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Damage is primarily in the form of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roof failure, loss of roof diaphragm material, connection failures, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tiedown/foundation failures. The most predictable areas for wind damage to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured housing are those subject most directly to hurricanes. Last year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki provided dramatic examples of the destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
faced by housing in hurricane-prone areas.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The damage to manufactured homes by Hurricane Andrew was so extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that many were rendered unrecognizable. Ninety-seven percent of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured homes in Dade County were totally destroyed, while only eleven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of single-family homes were destroyed. The American Red Cross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported that of the 1,176 licensed and registered manufactured homes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Homestead, Florida, 1,167 were completely destroyed. The American Red Cross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and FEMA have also reported a total of 11,213 manufactured homes destroyed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida and Louisiana in Hurricane Andrew, and an additional 3,016 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured homes experienced major damage. Almost 36% of all housing units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroyed during Hurricane Andrew were manufactured homes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The loss of these units had implications extending beyond the loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the homes and possessions of their owners. These homes, shredded by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winds, also became dangerous flying missiles, inflicting more property damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on neighboring structures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its October 1992 report on Hurricane Andrew, the Federal Emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Agency (FEMA) stated that, ``in all areas, mobile homes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(manufactured housing) were most susceptible to damage or destruction. Many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mobile homes imploded from the wind loads of Hurricane Andrew. In coastal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas, where mobile homes were properly `cradled' and elevated, the cradled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foundations remained intact, but the mobile homes mounted to these foundations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were often heavily damaged or destroyed.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerns for potential losses during high winds in coastal and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas were identified previously in a May 1991 report by the Federal Emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Agency (FEMA), which predicted that the United States can expect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more hurricanes of greater intensity during the 1990s and early 2000s than it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has experienced in recent years. Furthermore, estimates suggest that by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year 2010 the population density on Florida's coasts will have increased about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
130 percent from the 1988 level. Moreover, as the national population ages, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an increasing percentage of coastal inhabitants will probably be older 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals, a group more likely to occupy manufactured houses. The American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of Retired Persons (AARP) reports that 40 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchasers of new manufactured homes are at least 50 years old. The elderly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be more difficult to evacuate and may be more prone to be injured during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods of extreme high winds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The technology for achieving economical wind resistant designs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing is available. It involves calculations of risk for extreme wind-prone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coastal areas and the establishment of construction standards based upon these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk calculations. Through use and implementation of this approach, risks of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury and death can be minimized and economic loss limited to acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels in coastal areas subject to high winds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining a course of action to address these issues, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department had to balance two competing concerns: (1) The need to raise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured housing standards, to protect individuals, their homes, and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neighbors from future high winds; and (2) the need to preserve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affordability of a key source of low-cost housing. This rule is the result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department's decision to improve protection of homeowners in hurricane- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prone areas as soon as possible, but to delay making changes to the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in lower wind-risk areas, in order to give adequate consideration to cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors. Although the changes are expected to increase costs to consumers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the high-wind areas, the Department has concluded that the increases are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justified, because the improved standards will significantly reduce future 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses to occupants and the public by strengthening the features that make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured homes vulnerable to damage and destruction in high winds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Perhaps more importantly, the improved standards may help avoid the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inestimable costs of devastation to people's lives and emotional health and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the communities, in the likelihood that another powerful hurricane hits a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community of manufactured homes in the hurricane-prone regions of the country.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Among the major deficiencies contributing to manufactured housing damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Hurricane Andrew were inadequate connections between exterior roof or wall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverings and supporting sheathing or framing and between walls, roofs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floors. In particular, losses of roof coverings were widespread, and were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered by some to be the first mode of failure for manufactured homes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damaged in Hurricane Andrew. Other roof-related damage was due to loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sheathing, failure of connections, or a combination of these problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous failures of uplift straps also occurred, when the staples pulled out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the metal straps, permitting the straps to tear away from the members 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to which they had been fastened. In some cases, entire sections of roofs were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blown away. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another common area of failure was loss of exterior wall siding. Metal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or plastic siding used in manufactured housing was readily damaged or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penetrated by flying debris during the high winds in Hurricane Andrew. Loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of roof or wall cladding allows the building to be penetrated by the weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and has far-reaching consequences beyond the area of envelope integrity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these losses, and damage to windows and doors, there was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant water damage and deterioration to many manufactured homes. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, failure of coverings or attachments to the manufactured home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure also caused missile-type damage to other homes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other losses were precipitated by prior deterioration around windows and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
doors that had allowed moisture to enter, thereby weakening the resistance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrounding wood framing and floor decking. Apparently this deterioration was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a result of inadequate design or enforcement practices, or a combination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both. In some manufactured homes the loss of opening protection resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased internal pressures within the buildings, which contributed to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure of interior components including ceilings. In other cases, entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections of sliding glass doors on leeward walls were literally sucked out of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their frames because of inadequate resistance of the combined assembly to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wind forces imposed during Hurricane Andrew. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Edges and corners of roofs and endwalls of manufactured homes appeared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to have been particularly vulnerable to the high wind forces, according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage typically reported in these areas. Structural failures of endwalls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also occurred, but the presence of nearby interior shearwalls prevented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further losses (though not all designs are provided with interior shearwalls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the vicinity of the endwall). However, in many other cases, the entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
superstructure was completely removed from the floor system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous anchor system failures were reported in the areas subjected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the highest wind speeds. Many of the systems failed due to improper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation or the type of anchor used. In addition, anchor capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appeared to have been reduced further because of the saturated condition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the soil.

Summary of NIST Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of its review of the adequacy of the Federal Manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Housing Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS), the Department contracted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a study by Dr. Richard D. Marshall of the National Institute of Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Technology (NIST) [Report NISTIR 5189, May 1993]. According to Dr. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marshall and several other investigative reports, damage to manufactured homes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Hurricane Andrew ranged from loss of roofing to total destruction. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, HUD-labeled units suffered less damage than did pre-HUD units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, conventional residential construction adjacent to manufactured home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parks performed better, in some instances significantly better, than did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured homes. Based on wind speed assessments and damage surveys, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appears that HUD-labeled manufactured homes began to experience damage to roof 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and wall coverings at fastest-mile wind speeds of up to 95 mph (43 m/s), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant structural damage at wind speeds of from 100 to 120 mph (45 to 54 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
m/s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commonly observed failures included loss of roof membranes and blow-off 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of roof sheathing, failure of uplift straps at truss-to-wall connections where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staple crowns pulled through the strap, loss of cladding on endwalls and near 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corners where large negative (suction) pressures developed, loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appurtenances with resultant missile damage and damage to the primary house 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit at connection points, complete separation of the superstructure from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor and chassis frame, and loss of the complete unit because of the failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of tiedown straps or the withdrawal of soil anchors. The NIST report also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pointed out that the capacity of the anchors appeared to have exceeded the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marginal resistance of the superstructure, and that if the superstructure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separation failures had not occurred, the number of anchor systems failures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could have been much more widespread. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In almost every case in Florida, some form of anchoring had been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed. Outside the area of strongest winds, there were relatively few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anchor failures. Within the radius of strongest winds, anchor failures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were observed involved 2 ft. (610 mm) helical ground anchors (some embedded in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about 3 cu.ft. (0.8 cu.m) of concrete) or rock anchors into coral. No 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failures of 4 ft. (1.2 m) helical anchors were noted. However, it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear that any anchors of that length were actually installed in the area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjected to the highest winds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Marshall of NIST compared wind load provisions of the current FMHCSS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Standard ANSI/ASCE 7&hyph;88, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the South Florida Building Code, the Standard Building Code, and wind design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions proposed by the Manufactured Housing Institute. Based on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparisons of design loads for manufactured housing units of typical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dimension and geometry, considering the rationale for using importance factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and unreduced pressure coefficients, and in view of the fact that it is a true 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consensus standard, Dr. Marshall concluded that ANSI/ASCE
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
 7&hyph;88 should be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis for updating the wind load requirements for manufactured housing. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, since the NIST study only addressed design loads, in the interest of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety and economy, it was also recommended that prescriptive requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed standard be consistent with the specified design loads and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing and analysis to assure this consistency be conducted.

ASCE 7&hyph;88: Consensus Procedures for Development and Adoption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ASCE, founded in 1852, is the oldest civil engineering organization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the United States and has a membership of more than 110,000. The ANSI/ASCE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard 7&hyph;88, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(November 1990) (ASCE 7&hyph;88, in this preamble), was developed by ASCE based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies conducted at academic and research institutions in the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other parts of the world. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASCE 7&hyph;88 is the only truly consensus minimum design load standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently available in the United States. The ASCE rules, approved by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American National Standards Institute (ANSI), require all standards committees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to have a membership balanced between producers, consumers, building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials, and general interest groups. Each of these groups represents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between 20% to 40% of the committee membership. At the time ASCE 7&hyph;88 was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted, 89 members were on the standards committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The approval or revision of an ASCE standard is an elaborate process, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which involves extensive balloting and resolution of all negative votes. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a standard is to be adopted, the standards committee is broken down by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise into task committees. Those task committees draft the standard and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present it to the full standards committee for balloting. All objections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the standards committee are satisfied by one of three ways: (1) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objector agrees to withdraw the objection; (2) by a vote of 75%, the full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee accepts the objection and changes the standard; or (3) by a vote of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
75%, the full committee rejects the objection. The full committee then votes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for the standard to pass the full standards committee, at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
65% of the committee membership must vote and 75% of those votes must be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the affirmative. Moreover, the affirmative votes cannot be less than 55% of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the approved voting membership. After the standard passes the standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committee, it is issued to the public for further comment. As in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards committee, all objections are individually considered and processed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the same manner (i.e., withdrawn or accepted or rejected by a vote of 75% 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the standards committee). After a certain cutoff date and after all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objections are addressed, the standard is published as an ASCE consensus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard.

ASCE 7&hyph;88: Wind Load Provisions in Model Codes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Building codes in each State or local jurisdiction control the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and construction of buildings and structures in that jurisdiction. Most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communities in the United States adopt, in large part, one of the three model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building codes: the National Building Code of the Building Officials and Code 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrators International (BOCA); the Standard Building Code (SBC) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. (SBCCI); or the Uniform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building Code (UBC) of International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wind load provisions in these model building codes are based on the ASCE 7&hyph;88 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard, but with some modifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard considers all of the factors that influence the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnitude of wind loads on a building. In addition to wind speed, those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors include: (1) Terrain surrounding the building, (2) shape of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building, and (3) desired safety of the building frame and components. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model building codes use most of these factors from ASCE 7&hyph;88, but modify some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the factors based on experience; because of tradition, other factors are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some provisions of model building codes are adopted from industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manuals. The use, adoption, and modification of wind-load factors by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
model building codes result from an attempt to simplify the wind-load 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions and react to the concerns of affected industries and special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest groups. In general, these modifications by model code agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in lower design requirements for wind forces than would be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under ASCE 7&hyph;88. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even with these modifications, final wind loads for most buildings are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fairly consistent in all model building codes. All three of the major model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building codes incorporate the basic wind speed map of ASCE 7&hyph;88, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference the ASCE standard in whole or in part, but either modify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard or require additional prescriptive design and construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions. In addition, all three provide the use of ASCE 7&hyph;88 as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative to be applied at the discretion of the designer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the model building codes do not cover the design or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction of manufactured housing. The only control local governments have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over manufactured housing and mobile (manufactured) home parks is through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain zoning regulations, or anchoring, set-up, or installation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. As noted by one commenter (150) and discussed in the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of this preamble, incorporation of the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical to ensuring continued acceptance of manufactured housing by local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdictions in high wind areas.

Building Codes in Southern Florida 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, the local jurisdictions in Florida have adopted modifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the SBC or South Florida Building Code (SFBC). As one of its primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, the 18-member Dade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
County, Florida, Grand Jury stated that the 35-year-old South Florida Building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Code must be rewritten to duplicate the tougher, national wind standard of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASCE 7&hyph;88. The Grand Jury recognized ASCE 7&hyph;88 as a standard that more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately reflects the design strength necessary for windows and doors. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledgment of the Grand Jury's recommendations, the Dade County Building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Code Committee adopted (effective January 1, 1994) the Wind Loads section of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASCE 7&hyph;88, using Exposures C and D, only. The Grand Jury further recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that Dade County officials issue a moratorium on the permanent replacement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured homes until officials could be assured that the replacement homes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standards. Further, noting that lower standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to manufactured housing than to conventional housing, the 1992 Fall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Term Grand Jury asserted that ``the low standard amounted to discrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against those persons unable to afford the costs of conventional housing.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its Final Report, filed August 4, 1993, the Dade County Grand Jury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referenced the initial Grand Jury findings regarding the engineering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantages of the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard and commended its adoption into the SFBC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Grand Jury reported that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[T]his additional and essential modification of the SFBC should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provoke a wide-ranging improvement of most of our building 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designs, methods and products. It should also result in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building of structures that will provide greater safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security during a hurricane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to protect those living in and near manufactured homes, the Grand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jury has reiterated the recommendation that a moratorium be instituted on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation in the County of any new mobile homes that do not meet the wind-loading standards of ASCE 7&hyph;88. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the SBCCI, after assessing the damage caused by Hurricane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Andrew, concluded that standards applicable to manufactured housing need to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed to bring them up to the level of other construction types, unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
society is willing to consider manufactured homes to be expendable. The SBCCI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
said that even if manufactured homes are considered expendable, the issue of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hazard they present to neighboring buildings and structures needs to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed. Accordingly, they further concluded that steps need to be taken to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strengthen the structural frame, enforce tiedown provisions, and assure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the installation of homes is done by those who are knowledgeable in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the code. Unless these issues are addressed, the SBCCI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes there will continue to be great costs associated with hurricane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage.

Improved Anchoring and Foundation Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Enforcement of anchoring and tie-down systems for manufactured housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction has generally been considered a State or local government and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their building officials' responsibility. Section 3282.303 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manufactured Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulations (24 CFR part 3282) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urges, but does not require, State Administrative Agencies to monitor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation of manufactured homes. Thus, standards for foundations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anchorings and enforcement of those standards are not uniform among the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, and in some States are nonexistent. For example, the State of Florida 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has statewide laws related to installation, but enforcement of those laws is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
left to local building officials, while Louisiana is one of 23 States that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not regulate installation of manufactured homes at all.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Conference of Building Codes and Standards (NCSBCS), under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract with the Department, sent a team to inspect manufactured homes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damaged or destroyed by Hurricane Andrew. Their report, dated September 25, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992 (Rev. October 1, 1992), evaluated anchoring systems used in Florida and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Louisiana. The team found that virtually all manufactured homes they saw in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Florida had been anchored, but anchors had failed in most destroyed homes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the systems that failed were anchors embedded only two feet into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the soil, which were pulled out of the ground by the force of the storm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other systems that failed included short anchors embedded in concrete or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
driven into the coral. In Louisiana, most manufactured homes the team saw had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no anchoring systems at all, or only had two or three anchors on each side; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than one-half the number generally specified by manufacturers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions for hurricane zones. Also, where anchors were installed, most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had been installed incorrectly; often embedded only partially in the ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with 12
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; or more protruding above finished grade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the majority of anchoring system failures appeared to result from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improper installation, the NCSBCS Team observed several cases where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holding capacity of anchors appeared to have been reduced because of water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saturated soil. In order to determine the adequacy of anchoring systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed in soil that might be exposed to heavy rainfall and hurricane force 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
winds, further investigating and testing of anchors will be conducted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous failures reported after Hurricanes Andrew and Hugo and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previous wind storms support the Department's concerns over anchoring systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for manufactured housing that are inadequate to resist probable high wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forces. In addition, as the NIST Report indicated: ``[i]f superstructure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failures had not occurred [in Hurricane Andrew], the number of anchor system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failures might well have been greater &blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some field and laboratory testing of commercially available ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anchor and steel strapping systems has been conducted under a HUD contract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Wiss, Janney, &amp; Elstner, Inc. (See WJE Report No. 901798, July 26, 1991, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD USER_HUD&hyph;0005823). The initial test results indicate that anchors have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a significantly lower load resistance capacity than even the levels required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the current standard. Resistance or capacity would be even lower if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anchors are not installed in accordance with anchor manufacturer's and home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturer's installation instructions or under saturated soil conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has also been conducting laboratory tests to evaluate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance of manufactured home support and anchoring systems to lateral wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and seismic forces. After the results of the laboratory data have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated and compared to the field data, the Department may propose changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to lower allowable anchor system resistance values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interim, the Department cautions home and anchor manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installers, retailers, insurance companies, lenders, and State and local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government agencies that anchoring should be rated for specific soil, loading, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and installation conditions for which the anchor is acceptable. Failure to do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so may result in anchoring and tiedown systems which have inadequate ultimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity to resist probable design wind forces.

Characterization of Commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received 1,116 comments in response to the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the notice extending the comment period. Although approximately 235 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these comments are included in file of the Rules Docket Clerk as being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received under the extended deadline, many of these were delayed in receipt in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Rules Docket Clerk office because they were sent first to other offices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The great majority of the comments were duplicative or identical form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letters (of the 1,116 total comments, only 75 to 100 included distinctive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comments, Generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters acknowledged the need to update the Department's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for manufactured housing. One commenter (77) welcomed the better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publicity and reputation the industry would enjoy as a result of updated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. However, many of these commenters also stated opposition to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific standards proposed by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
About two dozen commenters, including consumer and insurance industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups, standards organizations, government agencies, and engineers, generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported the basic standard proposed (e.g., 17, 55, 76, 137, 145, 150, 197, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
633, 12

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), although several of these commenters also expressed concern about specific cost items. Supporting comments emphasized
the importance of affordable, safe housing, rather than merely affordable housing (17), and characterized ASCE
7&hyph;88 as the only consensus wind standard in the Country (76, and others).

Comment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The 30-day comment period allowed in the proposed rule did not permit sufficient consideration of the rule and development
of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments. In addition, the justification for the shortened effective date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the proposed rule had indicated would apply to the final rule was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
justified by the need to implement regulatory changes before the 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hurricane season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Because of the numerous requests for longer response periods from both the public and members of Congress, and because
it was apparent that a rule could not be in place in time for the 1993 hurricane season, the Department has allowed additional
time for public comments and implementation of the final rule. The proposed rule was published on April 14, 1993, and
the comment period was extended to July 9, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the Department's desire to consider the full extent of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response on this rule, the Department has continued to receive comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regularly while the final rule and regulatory impact analysis were being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared and has continued to log and review those comments. Therefore, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect, the comment period for this rule has been approximately 5 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To alleviate the concerns relating to the industry's need for ample time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to redesign homes and retool manufacturing facilities, the Department has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided to extend the effective date originally proposed for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the rule provides for an effective date of, at least, 180 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from today's date of publication. Thus, the concerns of the commenters in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regards have been addressed by the Department.

of improved standards, the Department made an extraordinary effort to consult with the individual members of the
Advisory Council. The responses of a number of the individual members of the Advisory Council have been considered
and included in the docket file for this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Later, because of the Department's extension of the comment period and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognition that a final rule could not be in place in time for the 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hurricane season, the Department immediately convened the Advisory Council so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it could discuss the proposal as a panel. The resulting recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Advisory Council, as a panel, also have been considered carefully in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining both the scope and the specific requirements of this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Several commenters questioned the impact of the rule on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families, in the context of Executive Order 12606, which requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of the impact of a regulation on family formation, maintenance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and general well-being. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: In the proposed rule, the Department indicated that the rule was not subject to review under the Executive Order.
The commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questioned this position based on information that some potential consumers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be unable to purchase manufactured homes if the prices of those homes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were raised to cover the costs of the new standards. To the extent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production cost increases resulting from this rule will be passed on to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers, one effect of the rule is expected to be the loss of marginal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers from the market. Some of these marginal consumers will have to find 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less expensive, rental housing; some will opt for comparably priced site-built 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housing. However, the significance of this result is not a loss of housing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but a redistribution of the kinds of housing available. Although as a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some families may lose an ownership option, the general well-being of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families, and society, is served better by ensuring adequate quality standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for such housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Department does not believe this final rule implicates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family concerns within the spirit of the Executive Order, the Department has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyzed the rule as required under the Order. Therefore, in the paragraph on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12606 under the ``Other Matters'' section of this preamble, the Department certifies that the requirements
of the Order have been met in the issuance of this rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The proposed rule indicated that manufacturers should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipate the contents of the final rule and should prepare to comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the more stringent standards soon after publication of the final rule. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule for implementation of the new standards fails to recognize the need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for lead time to design, test, and seek approval of changes necessitated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the standard changes. In addition, while personnel resources are concentrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the redesign requirement, production personnel may have to be laid off. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This problem is compounded by the possibility that another redesign will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary as a result of the new Federal energy standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: To a large extent, the Department already has been responsive to the concerns expressed in this comment by conceding
that the rule will not become effective for 180 days. The Department is sensitive to the procedural requirements that
a manufacturer faces when undertaking design changes. However, there is no doubt that by the time this rule becomes
effective, all aspects of the industry should have had sufficient advance notice of the necessary product improvements
to prepare for implementation of the new standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Innovative solutions and safer products generally depend on some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial incentive. The Department believes, based on the knowledge of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical staff, the reports they have reviewed, and some of the comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received, that those parties involved in the production, sales, and siting of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured housing will be able to comply with these standards reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quickly, when continued sales depend on such compliance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The cost impact of the standard changes should be analyzed, as required by Executive Order 12291 and 42 U.S.C. 5403(f),
and a regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact analysis should be prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: As stated in the ``Other Matters'' section of the preamble of the proposed rule (57 FR 19539), the Department agreed
that it would prepare and submit a regulatory impact analysis before publication of the final rule, in accordance
with established Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance. Although many of the benefits, and some costs, of
increased standards are difficult to quantify for purposes of such an economic analysis (e.g., loss of life, uninsured
costs, insurance deductibles, and injuries), the Department has complied with the requirements of Executive Order
12866 (September 30, 1993) and OMB. As noted under ``Significant Regulatory Action'' in the ``Other Matters'' section
of this preamble, a final regulatory analysis based on the provisions in this final rule is available to the public.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, while economic concerns have always been an important component 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Department's decisionmaking process and, in this case, resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of the rule, the Department stresses that its statutory mandate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to reduce the number of personal injuries and deaths and the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance costs and property damage resulting from manufactured home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents, and to improve the quality and durability of manufactured homes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires that the Department look beyond affordability issues. In promoting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
homeownership opportunities for lower-income persons, the Department strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that such housing must also be safe. The concern with safety extends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond the occupants of the housing, to all those who may be affected by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure of such housing to meet minimum performance standards under reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreseeable conditions. For example, in a Federal Emergency Management Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FEMA) report on ``Building Performance: Hurricane Andrew in Florida'' (FIA&hyph;22, 2/93), cited by commenter
76,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
It was observed that the breakup of corrugated metal siding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roofed buildings such as manufactured homes and pre-engineered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metal frame buildings contributed significantly to the generation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of airborne debris. This was evident from debris damage to nearby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downwind structures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated by another commenter (205
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
(2)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
): ``The prospect of reducing the loss of life and property and reducing the cost of disaster relief efforts from such
losses as Hurricane Andrew would certainly be to the benefit of the entire housing industry and the individual and
corporate citizen taxpayers of the United States.'' In addition, the upgrades required under this rule also would
increase the ability of the homes to withstand damage during transportation and installation of the units, and the
improved windows would be more energy efficient (see comment 150).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department recognizes the viability of manufactured housing as a source of affordable housing for many people
and will continue to work with the industry to ensure a quality product at a reasonable cost. However, the Department
will also continue to exercise all of its statutory responsibilities relating to housing and its occupants in a manner
that serves the optimal societal interests. This final rule is evidence that the Department agrees with those commenters
that said the savings in storm damage repair, loss of personal property, and potential personal injury or loss of life,
in addition to other expected benefits, exceeds the cost differential for these new standards. The Department has
also reviewed cost impact figures provided by numerous commenters during the development of the final regulatory
impact analysis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The increased cost of manufactured housing that will be the result of the more stringent standards may price many consumers
out of the market for unsubsidized housing. A home manufactured to the new standards will require a higher downpayment,
and potential consumers will find it more difficult to qualify for financing. The level of regulation proposed would
limit consumer choice and would deny consumers the right to match housing to their budgets (1).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department is concerned about the effect of these standards on the ability of consumers to afford and purchase
manufactured housing. However, because the standards are, for the most part, performance standards and do not prescribe
methods of construction, the manufactured housing industry can, and the Department expects will, approach this
problem by developing innovative designs, components, and construction techniques that meet the standards but
maintain the affordability of manufactured homes. The Department has also removed some of the proposed prescriptive
requirements. These changes from the proposed rule should help maintain the affordability of manufactured housing
while still assuring safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated by one commenter (215
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
(2)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), sacrificing a minimum reasonable wind standard for manufactured housing so that it can be more affordable makes
as much sense as allowing a car to be sold without brakes for the same reason. A similar opinion was expressed by a consumer,
who commented (117
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If tougher standards increase the cost of a mobile home by a fair percentage I believe people will be willing to pay a
little more for better protection. Most of these homes are not second homes but the principal residence of retirees.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Earlier in the preamble the Department acknowledges the legitimate concern with affordability, but also notes the
importance of safe housing that protects other societal interests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conversely, as noted by commenter 145 (FEMA), ``[t]he disruption of lives and families resulting from the damage
to manufactured housing often happens to those least able to fully recover.'' Therefore, the financial impact of
insufficient standards also may fall most heavily on those least able to absorb that impact. The Department agrees
with commenter 215
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
(2)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the poor should not have to accept a lower safety factor against catastrophic failure of housing than the rest
of society.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, a commenter representing a number of insurance carriers (17) noted that builder/developer estimates of
cost increases for building code improvements for site-built structures have far exceeded documented incremental
cost increases in the past. The commenter observed that cost estimates with respect to manufactured housing and the
higher standards proposed by the Department may contain similar exaggerations. This possibility is discussed by
the Department in the regulatory impact analysis prepared in connection with this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In looking at storm damage estimates for purposes of a cost-benefit analysis, the Department should distinguish
damage to manufactured homes that complied with existing HUD standards from damage to pre-HUD homes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As previously discussed, both manufactured homes built before the imposition of HUD standards and those built after
the standards became effective experienced significant damage during Hurricane Andrew. Therefore, the numerical
breakdown between pre- and post-HUD standards is not a determinative factor in the Department's process with respect
to the final content of this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in its comments on this rule, the AARP (commenter 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
150) noted that ``[w]hile more than half of the manufactured homes destroyed were built prior to implementation of
the HUD standards, many of these older homes were constructed in accordance with American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) Standard A119.1, which had the same wind load resistance requirements as the current HUD standards.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As a practical matter, manufacturers will build their homes to the most stringent standards that would apply to their
sales areas. Therefore, those manufacturers that would build homes for more than one zone will build all their homes
to accommodate the highest wind load requirements, and the cost of compliance with the new standards will actually
be higher than the estimates that are based on numbers of units per Zone (12).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department does not discourage voluntary compliance with standards that are higher than those required. However,
the Department believes that the decision to comply voluntarily with higher standards will be controlled by the cost
of such compliance and the manufacturer's market demands. Accordingly, such compliance is questionable and cannot
be considered in the regulatory impact analysis.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The implementation of new standards will adversely affect the marketability of existing homes not built to those
standards (87), leading to increased defaults and credit losses (139).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The standards implemented by this rule will not affect manufactured homes already occupied by consumers. Thus, the
resale market for these existing units generally should not be affected, except to the extent that prospective purchasers
have the financial resources, realize the construction limitations of the existing units, and choose to purchase
units meeting the new standard or other housing options. Because prospective purchasers of used manufactured housing
are likely to be in lower income brackets, however, the Department expects little or no impact on the resale market
for manufactured homes already occupied by consumers.

 The additional cost attributable to increased costs for lumber is of particular concern (639).

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted above, the Department is concerned about all additional costs and the affordability of homes constructed
to the new standards. Any specific concern with lumber costs has been alleviated because of recent changes in market
conditions, which have shown that high prices being charged for lumber earlier this year were an aberration. Lumber
costs have significantly reduced since original cost estimates were prepared. In addition, the final rule will permit
the use of the 1991 NDS without exception, which lowers earlier manufactured housing industry projections of the
lumber changes and estimated costs for complying with the new standards.

 A number of the prescriptive standards in the proposed rule have been removed in the final rule. For those that remain,

 Because the proposed rule was largely justified as a response to damages incurred in hurricane-prone areas, the standards
and time frames contained in the proposed rule should not be applied to other zones subject to lower wind speeds.

 At this time the Department has deleted the proposed changes to Zone I from the final rule. Therefore, homes designated
to be sited in Zone I must comply with the previous wind standard for those areas. However, many commenters and the Advisory
Council indicated that the Department should strive to bring the Federal standards to a level of comparability with
conventional housing standards. The Department will review existing wind standards in the remaining areas of the
country for possible future action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has not demonstrated that ASCE 7&hyph;88 is the appropriate standard to be adopted for the higher wind
loading requirements. For example, the Standard Building Code may be a more appropriate standard for the purposes
of this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of engineers have written in support of the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard, noting that the standard was developed
based on scientific studies performed in wind tunnels, which were subsequently verified by tests on full-scale structures.
By adopting the Southern Florida Building Code (SFBC), which incorporates the Standard Building Code, the people
of south Florida thought they were protected by one of the toughest building codes, with respect to wind. However,
the wind load requirements of the SFBC now have been surpassed by other codes that are based on recent research. For
example, the SFBC does not reflect peak gusts or use pressure coefficients as high as are now considered suitable.
As a result, the SFBC design wind speed of 120 mph would only correspond to a design wind speed of less than 100 mph for
many elements of the construction. As previously noted in this preamble, Dade County has adopted (effective January
1, 1994) the wind loads section of ASCE 7&hyph;88, using Exposures C and D, only.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No model code has adopted the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard. The Department does not justify its attempt to impose more stringent
standards for manufactured housing than are applied to site-built homes. It is an abuse of Federal authority to impose
standards that go well beyond any State building code currently in existence (87).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The relationship between the model codes and ASCE 7&hyph;88 is discussed earlier in the preamble in the section on
Development and Adoption of ASCE 7&hyph;88. In addition, the Department notes that the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard already
is incorporated into its Minimum Property Standards (24 CFR part 200, subpart S), which apply to certain site-built
housing within the Department's jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current wind load requirements for manufactured housing for high wind zones correspond to a wind speed of 80 mph;
other types of housing are subject to much higher design wind speed requirements in the same high wind areas. Therefore,
as noted by the AARP in its comments (150), adoption of ASCE 7&hyph;88 actually will ensure substantial equivalence
of wind design requirements between manufactured and site-built housing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties in Florida have adopted ASCE 7&hyph;88 (with the 110 mph wind
load) for site-built homes, and the Department believes other coastal jurisdictions will follow. Model codes also
have adopted or are moving toward the adoption of the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard. In fact, by not including the higher
standards for the remainder of the country (Zone I), a majority of manufactured homes produced in this country will
comply to a standard well below the building codes currently in existence for site-built housing.

 The Department considered the deemed-to-comply standards, but determined that a performance standard would allow
manufacturers flexibility to be innovative in their approach to compliance with the standards. Such innovation

 The proposed rule did not address testing issues. The Department does not specify whether the proposed structural
design changes have been subjected to destruction testing. (144) Although there is no agreement on a testing protocol,
truss suppliers will need time to retest their many truss designs. (8, 16, and incorporated by reference in others)
The need to test many types of siding, siding gauges (thicknesses), and accessories, fasteners, and fastener patterns
also may lead to tooling changes, which will require more time. (9)

 Testing will continue to be evaluated under the DAPIA review process, which is not revised by this rule. However, the
Department has extended, to 180 days (or, for some provisions, one year) from today's publication of the rule, the
implementation schedule for the new requirements, in order to give producers sufficient time to comply with the standards.

 The existence of multiple wind zones and corresponding requirements within a single State creates difficulties
with respect to enforcement, as well as with production. It is not clear who bears the responsibility for monitoring
the placement of homes within a wind zone for which they are intended (87, 91, 92, 610).

 The Department appreciates the difficulties of enforcing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards when multiple zones exist in a single State. Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department has specifically listed those local governments in the higher wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zones in each State. Depending on the facts surrounding the sale of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured home, both the manufacturer and the dealer will be responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for assuring that the home will be in compliance with the standards by siting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the home in the proper zone. The State Administrative Agencies (SAAs) will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
informed of the changes resulting from this rule and will assist the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department in discovering homes that are sited in noncompliance with these

 The change in lease communities could be revolutionary, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
homes become more permanent in nature (122) and homes are taxed more as real, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than personal, property. Generally, lessors are required to restore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the site to its original condition when they move. This requirement, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relocation of utility connections, would be made more difficult with more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent foundations. In addition, the FHA Title II allowance for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation would not be sufficient for the additional costs of permanent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foundations (146, and others).

 The Department has evaluated these comments and has removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the design requirement for a permanent foundation. However, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remains concerned that some form of strengthened tiedown system may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to protect homes adequately in high wind areas. Thus, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department will be reviewing the issue of permanent foundations and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strengthened anchoring systems in conjunction with regulatory action on wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistant design and construction requirements for the remainder of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The impact of the new Wind Standards can be adversely effected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if there is inadequate enforcement and monitoring of the placement of homes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure that only homes that have been designed for the wind load requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Zone are permitted to be sited. There is a need for better local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection; the home is only as good as its anchoring system (149). There is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compelling evidence that much of the damage from Hurricane Andrew was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to the lax enforcement of State and local building codes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including anchoring requirements, rather than to inadequate standards (80, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
122). Similarly, the main problem with manufactured homes is the proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation of anchoring equipment, which the Department cannot regulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(100).

 Although the use of tiedowns was widespread in the areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by Hurricane Andrew, indicating some attempt to comply with codes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tiedowns generally performed very poorly. None of the tiedowns observed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was certified in accordance with code requirements. The Department is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing the authority to regulate installation of manufactured homes and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exploring ways to encourage States and localities to adopt and enforce more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent anchoring requirements. The Department also is reviewing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate methods, including a disclosure requirement, to inform consumers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the installation of the home in a manner that achieves the highest wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection performance for the home's design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meanwhile, the Department will be contacting the Governors of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, and in particular States where the wind risk is the greatest, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advise the Governors of the changes in the wind standards and the need for

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 With very few exceptions, manufactured homes in the path of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hurricane Andrew were destroyed by the resulting wind forces. The lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate attachment of single or double-wide units to ground anchors was a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
major factor in loss of units. The chassis of some units could be found some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distance away from their original site. However, in some cases the anchors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did hold the floor of the unit down while the ``box'' of the structure was torn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
away by the high winds. For this reason, there is justification for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing the strength of the structure by this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effective date of these new requirements will now be at least 180 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days from today. The Department agrees that innovative anchoring systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparable to permanent foundations systems can be developed; however, anchor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers are cautioned regarding the resistance capacity of auger-type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anchors presently used for installing manufactured homes, when those anchors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are subject to high winds and ensuing saturated soil conditions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department's tests show substantially less resistance than required by 24 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3280.306(f), even when tested under dry soil conditions.

 Alternative anchoring systems that are expected to provide

market. The Department believes that if siting requirements are increased by

develop ways to accommodate siting in land-lease communities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department has not justified its proposal to require a lower load duration factor for designing wood members and
fastenings to resist wind forces than is specified in the 1991 edition of the National Design Specification for Wood
Construction (NDS) published by the American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department agrees that the higher factor of 1.6 in the NDS has been justified by research completed by AFPA for wood
members subjected to short duration loads of 10 minutes or less. This is generally recognized as the maximum period
for exposure of structures to wind forces. In addition, the 1991 NDS has already been adopted without exception by
certain model code agencies. However, cyclic testing to evaluate fasteners and connectors has not yet been completed.
Preliminary results suggest that a higher load duration factor may be appropriate. Therefore, the Department will
accept the higher load duration factor of 1.6 on an interim basis and will recognize the 1991 NDS without exception
in this final rule. The Department intends to monitor this research and may propose a different load duration factor
for fasteners and connectors in the future, subject to the research and test results.

 There is no basis for the 12'' limitation and prescriptive requirements for eave and cornice projections; their implementation
would inhibit design innovations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While longer eave and overhang projections will subject trusses, fasteners, and connectors to significant increases
in design loads, and thereby increase their likelihood of failure under extreme wind conditions, the Department
agrees that the provision should be removed because it does restrict innovation, and truss and home manufacturers
are capable of designing roof systems and connections to resist the higher wind forces. However, manufacturers that
use larger projections than 12 inches are cautioned to review their designs carefully to assure that all components
and fastenings are adequate to resist the design pressures specified in ASCE 7&hyph;88 or the table in &sect;3280.304.

 The prescriptive requirements for sidewall-to-roof and floor connections using steel strapping or brackets should
be replaced with performance criteria that permit the use of alternative methods of connection, such as structural
sheathing that overlaps the roof and floor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In general, the Department agrees that the use of performance-based standards is preferred. However, on-site investigations
of the damage from Hurricane Andrew revealed that current designs using 30 gage straps failed. Based on the above information,
the Department has retained the prescriptive requirement for strapping in high wind areas, but will permit to be used
a combination of strapping and structural sheathing that overlaps the roof or floor, instead of only steel straps
or brackets, provided the sheathing and its fastenings are demonstrated by calculations or tests to have equivalent
strength and resistance to the design wind uplift forces.

 The use of the 1.5 factor of safety for design of anchoring systems is not consistent with ASCE 7&hyph;88. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department concurs that there is no provision in the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard for increasing the wind pressures
for the design of anchoring systems to resist overturning and sliding forces. Therefore, the anchoring design provisions
for Wind Zones II and III, which are based on the ASCE 7&hyph;88 requirements, will not require the application of the
1.5 factor of safety to be applied to the design wind drag and uplift pressures. However, the 1.5 factor of safety will
continue to be required for calculating the required resistance of anchoring systems for Wind Zone I, since the design
lateral and uplift wind forces remain based on the current standard, which is lower than all model building codes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Existing truss testing procedures in &sect;3280.402(c)(2) should be clarified as to: (1) The acceptability of existing
inverted truss testing procedures for evaluating new wind uplift design loads; (2) whether vertical live and gravity
roof load testing must still be conducted with trusses in the upright position when uplift forces are higher than downward
loads; and (3) whether eave loads are to be applied simultaneously with roof uplift loads.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) The inverted test method may continue to be used on an interim basis while the Department evaluates results of an
industry study to compare results of the existing test method, which applies load to the bottom chord of the truss,
to results obtained from applying the load to the top chord of the truss. (2) Testing must continue to be conducted in
the upright position, because the loads are applied to different members (chords) of the truss. (3) Uplift loads are
to be applied to truss eave projections when uplift loads are applied to the truss bottom chords during each loading
phase required by &sect;3280.402(c)(2).

The Department encourages manufacturers to provide shutters

to include shutter information on the data plate. The instructions must

provide a method for protecting the windows and doors that is capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withstanding design wind pressures without taking the home out of conformance

addition of appurtenances to manufactured homes, such as porches, carports, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and canopies, which experienced a large number of failures in Hurricane

Andrew. The danger to occupants is further increased because the rule does

Under 24 CFR 3282.8(j) the standards currently do not govern

add-ons, as long as the add-on doesn't affect the ability of the home to

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has authority to promulgate standards for some add-ons. Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department is examining its authority in this area and may establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in the future. In the interim, HUD encourages all States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish standards covering the construction and attachment of these kinds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appurtenances to manufactured homes.

Under this rule manufacturers are required to include on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data plate a statement that units designed to meet the minimum standards in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule should not be located within 1500 feet of the coastline in Zones II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and III. By this statement, the consumer is alerted that only units designed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and anchored according to the higher design standards specified for coastal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas in ASCE 7&hyph;88 should be placed along the coastline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``Wind safety'' is a misnomer; the science of weather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forecasting allows ample notice of dangerous storms to permit evacuation (296&hyph;314). Homeowner safety is better
served by evacuation in high winds than from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection afforded by the manufactured home structure. If a manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home is purported to be designed and constructed to withstand higher wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speeds, occupants may be less likely to evacuate the homes at the approach of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a dangerous storm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department agrees that if it is safe to do so, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
homeowners should attempt to reach a shelter capable of resisting high winds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, without the imposition of these enhanced Wind Safety Standards, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers of deaths and injuries attributable to the inadequate performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured homes in high winds will continue unabated. In addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing deaths and injuries, the Department's statutory responsibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the implementation of higher wind standards to reduce the insurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost and amount of property damage resulting from manufactured home accidents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and improvement of the quality and durability of manufactured homes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that these higher wind standards will fulfill those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NIST study cited by the Department does not fault the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of trusses; increasing the uplift requirements would not improve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the quality of assembly. The problems associated with manufactured housing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are related more to fasteners and tiedowns (13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
(2)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The field studies referenced in the NIST Report identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerous roof system failures that were generally due to failure of the end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connections between the trusses and the sidewalls. However, even if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trusses had been properly connected to the manufactured home structure, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department believes that trusses not designed to resist the uplift pressures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referenced in this rule still may have failed. Therefore, in this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department has retained the proposed increased design requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roof trusses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is encouraged to coordinate this rule with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review of seismic and flood loads, especially with respect to foundation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attachment designs (25).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements in the proposed rule for a permanent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foundation design have been eliminated in this final rule. However, as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department continues to review the issue of adequate anchoring/foundation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems for manufactured homes, it will also review these other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are not enough DAPIA personnel in the HUD system to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and approve design changes within the time provided for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of this rule (83, 124, 136, 179). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has agreed to delay the effectiveness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new requirements for 180 days, which should allow sufficient time for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DAPIA process, as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department should consider requiring the DAPIA approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stamp on all pages of a manufacturer's installation instructions (48). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule continues to require that the manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide installation instructions certified by a registered professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engineer indicating at least one acceptable system of anchoring (24 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3280.306(b)). However, the Department will consider the suggestion to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a DAPIA approval stamp on each page of the manufacturers' installation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions when developing future revisions to the Manufactured Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedural and Enforcement Regulations (24 CFR part 3282).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some explanation is needed about the effect of the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards on ``B'' letters, interpretative bulletins, and compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations (122). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This new standard supersedes any portions of ``B'' letters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretative bulletins, and compliance determinations that are in conflict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this standard.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the higher standards are adopted, manufacturers will prefer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to build modular homes that meet the necessary State standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Manufacturers are free to channel their activities in any way 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that best responds to market forces. In the development of the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact analysis, the Department has accounted for the cost of potential lost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business. To the extent that manufacturers could redirect their production to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative housing, the costs of the higher standards would be lessened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as noted above, the Department believes that the trend in State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards also will be to stricter wind standards. Therefore, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured homes may experience a price increase because of these standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they will be affordable relative to site-built homes meeting the higher State-imposed standards.

As noted in the discussion on Improved Anchoring and

installation. As part of that review, the Department may consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements on the disclosure of general information relating to high winds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and hurricanes, and may coordinate with FEMA on the development of a brochure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on hurricane awareness and protection for occupants of manufactured homes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Description of Changes to the Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the risk of loss of life to building occupants and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extraordinary loss of property due to Hurricane Andrew, the Department has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that it is necessary to amend the Federal Manufactured Home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS) to raise the level of wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance standards, especially in areas subject to high winds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the Department is amending the FMHCSS to include a Basic Wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Zone Map that is based on the map contained in the incorporated standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASCE 7&hyph;88, ``Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised map contains a more concentrated area for the 100 mph wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zone than was specified in the current standard or the proposed rule. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary between Wind Zones I and II follows the 90 mph isotach on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASCE 7&hyph;88 basic wind speed map, while the boundary between Wind Zones II and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III remains the 100 mph isotach indicated in the proposed rule. The design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wind speeds for high wind areas are designated as 100 mph for Wind Zone II and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
110 mph for Wind Zone III. This rule does not change the current design wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
speed for Wind Zone I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the revised map, this final rule enumerates the States, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Territories, and local governments in which the more stringent standards will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be applicable. The enumerated areas are those that the Department has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined to be at least partially within the higher wind zones demarcated on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the revised map. The Department also will monitor local building code 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements and will consider adoption through rulemaking of requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured homes that are comparable to any more stringent requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established for site-built homes by a State or local building authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current wind standard for manufactured housing is considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadequate because it addresses only positive (external) design wind pressures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for walls, components, windows, and cladding, without specifying that designs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must take into account the effect of negative pressure (suction) on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building elements, as well as internal pressures on walls and roof/ceiling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. The formulae used in ASCE 7&hyph;88 also include other factors, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account for higher uplift forces on roof eaves, ridges, overhangs, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corners. These and other issues are now addressed in high wind areas by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring the manufactured home structure, components, and cladding to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to resist design wind forces for Exposure C, as specified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ASCE 7&hyph;88.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Requirements for structural assemblies, components, connectors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fasteners, and a number of other areas will be strengthened so that parts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions of the home will be able to resist the same wind forces as required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for site-built and modular housing. In addition, the increased wind loads 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by this rule are applicable whether structural systems, components, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or other aspects of the design are substantiated by engineering analysis or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable load tests (see subpart E of part 3280). The revised standards also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that the ground anchoring and foundation support systems continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be designed by a registered engineer or architect in a manner adequate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withstand the higher wind forces specified.

III. Section-by-Section Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has determined that the following changes should be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the standards: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 3280.4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added to the list of organizations issuing standards that are incorporated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference. The street addresses are corrected for two other organizations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 3280.5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Technical and conforming corrections are made to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardize paragraph designations to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 format and clarify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to be included on data plates. The new requirements also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporate changes to the data plate adopted in the Energy Rule (58 FR 54975, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
55003) for effect in October 1994, in order to avoid having inconsistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements become effective within a short time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data plate is also being expanded to indicate that manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
homes should not be located within 1500
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; of the coastline in Wind Zones II and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
III unless the home and its anchoring or foundation system are designed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the increased requirements of Exposure D in ASCE 7&hyph;88. The data plate will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
now also indicate whether the home has been equipped with storm shutters and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if shutters are not provided, will strongly recommend that the home be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready for these devices in accordance with the method described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installation instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sections 3280.302(a)(8), 3280.303(d), 3280.305(c)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and references to ``hurricane resistive design'' in these sections are deleted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in favor of the Wind Zone II and III designations in the revised Basic Wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Zone Map. These changes will result in the identification of design wind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forces and wind speeds for which the home has been designed, rather than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation of homes as ``hurricane resistive.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 3280.304
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The incorporated standards are amended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that the minimum design loads be based on ASCE 7&hyph;88, which replaces 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the obsolete ANSI A58.1&hyph;1982 standard currently referenced in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the National Design Specification for Wood Members (NDS), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated by reference, is updated to the most current specification issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA). Because manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will need to redesign the structure's resistance to wind forces, the redesign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be accomplished with the most current design values for wood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the 1991 NDS is incorporated in its entirety into the standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 3280.305(c)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The standards are amended to require that for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufactured homes in high wind areas, the home and each wind resisting part, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including components and cladding, be completely designed to resist the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wind pressures specified for a 50-year recurrence level by ASCE 7&hyph;88 or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressures specified in a table of equivalent design wind load provisions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department has designated three wind zones: Zone I (current wind design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for Zone I); Zone II (design wind speed of 100 mph); and Zone III 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(design wind speed of 110 mph). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Table of Design Pressures in the proposed rule is clarified and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded. Editorial revisions to clarify the application of the uplift 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure requirements for exterior roof coverings, eaves and gables. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, footnotes are included to indicate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Distributional pressure effects between windward and leeward walls; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The application of the Table is limited to roof slopes between 10 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 degrees and that horizontal drag pressures need not be considered for roof 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slopes under 20 degrees; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The design uplift pressures are the same regardless of whether they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are applied normal to the roof surface or to the horizontal projection of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
roof; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Exterior roof and wall coverings (excluding glazing), sheathing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fastenings need not be evaluated for the design pressures specified by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table, when fastened to a 3/8
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; structural rated sheathing and the sheathing is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oriented and secured to framing members in accordance with the fastening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule specified in the Table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Basic Wind Zone Map is revised by delineating the boundary between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wind Zones I and II as the 90 mph isotach, and the boundary between Wind Zones 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II and III as the 100 mph isotach, on the ASCE 7&hyph;88 basic wind speed map. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change will result in certain areas of existing Wind Zone II being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in the modified Wind Zone I. The boundary between Wind Zones I and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

_Interpretative Bulletin D&hyph;5&hyph;76, under which the Department has been operating since the late 1970s,
is paraphrased as a new paragraph (2). It clarifies that the deflection limit for a cantilevered roof is 2 times the
length divided by 180. Eaves and cornices shall be designed for a net uplift pressure of 2.5 times the design uplift
wind pressure cited in &sect;3280.305(c)(1)(i) for Wind Zone I, and for the design pressures cited in &sect;3280.305(c)(1)(ii)
for Wind Zones II and III. This change has already been issued in the Energy Rule (58 FR 54975, 55006), but is modified
in this rule to reflect the standards established for the new Wind Zones.

_The standards for fastening of roof framing to wall framing and wall to floor framing are changed to require the use
of 26 gage minimum steel strapping, or those elements shall be connected by a combination of strapping and structural
rated wall sheathing that overlaps the roof and floor. Investigations after Hurricane Andrew revealed that current
designs allowed 30 gage straps with staples for connections of roofs to walls, and walls to floors; such straps were
inadequate to resist even moderate wind forces.

Significant Regulatory Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director of the Office of Management and Budget has indicated that this rule could constitute a ``significant
regulatory action'' as that term is defined in section 3(f) of the Executive Order on Regulatory Planning and Review
issued by the President on September 30, 1993. Because an estimation of the new requirements as proposed indicated
that they might have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, a regulatory impact analysis has been prepared
for this final rule. This analysis concludes that the requirements that will be imposed by this final rule will have
an effect on the economy of less than $100 million, and will have benefits that outweigh the costs of the additional
requirements. This analysis is available for public inspection during regular business hours in room 10276, Rules
Docket Clerk, Office of General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington,
DC 20410.

Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before
publication and by approving it certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. However, the regulatory impact analysis referenced in the preceding paragraph also provides
relevant analysis and discussion of possible economic impact on businesses, including small businesses, that must
comply with the provisions of this rule. The rule will establish additional safety standards for manufactured housing,
and therefore would affect the design and construction requirements in specified areas of the country. The nature
of the rule and its purpose do not present an opportunity for the Department to vary the rule's requirements so as to
reduce burdens on small entities.

Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the time of publication of the proposed rule, a finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment
was made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The proposed rule is adopted by this final rule without any change that would be
significant for purposes of additional environmental impact. Accordingly, the initial finding of no significant
impact remains applicable, and is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the
office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address.

Executive Order 12612, Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule have federalism implications, and are subject to review under the Order.
Specifically, the rule provides for mandatory specifications for the construction of manufactured homes that exceed
the standards currently permitted in certain areas of the country. States and local governments would no longer have
the option of imposing separate requirements that exceed current standards, but are less stringent than these new
standards. However, because the Federal standards already preempt local discretion in the construction of manufactured
homes, this marginal degree of preemption is not believed to be significant for purposes of identifying federalism
concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, for these reasons and because of the health and safety aspects of this rule, the General Counsel has determined
that the federalism implications are not sufficient to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment under
the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12606, the Family
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposed rule, the Department indicated that the rule was not subject to review under Executive Order 12606,
The Family. As addressed earlier in this preamble, some of the commenters were concerned about this position. Although
the Department does not believe this final rule implicates family concerns within the spirit of the Executive Order,
the Department has analyzed the rule as required under the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under the Executive Order, has evaluated the potential of this rule
to have a significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. Although as a result of the
more stringent construction requirements implemented by this rule, some families may lose an ownership option for
housing, the general well-being of families, and society, is served better by ensuring minimal quality standards
for such housing. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has certified that, to the extent permitted by law,
the rule has undergone a Family Impact Assessment under the Executive Order.

General
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Each manufactured home shall be designed and constructed as a completely integrated structure capable of sustaining
the design load requirements of this standard, and shall be capable of transmitting these loads to stabilizing devices
without exceeding the allowable stresses or deflections. Roof framing shall be securely fastened to wall framing,
walls to floor structure, and floor structure to chassis to secure and maintain continuity between the floor and chassis,
so as to resist wind overturning, uplift, and sliding as imposed by design loads in this part. Uncompressed finished
flooring greater than 1/8 inch in thickness shall not extend beneath load-bearing walls that are fastened to the floor
structure.

(3) When engineering calculations are performed, allowable unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stresses may be increased as provided in the documents referenced in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;3280.304 except as otherwise indicated in &sect;&sect;3280.304(b)(1) and 3280.306(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Whenever the roof slope does not exceed 20 degrees, the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizontal wind loads required by &sect;3280.305(c)(1) may be determined without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the vertical roof projection of the manufactured home. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of the roof slope of the manufactured home, the vertical roof 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projection shall be included when determining the wind loading for split level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or clerestory-type roof systems.

Provisions for support and anchoring systems. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each manufactured home shall have provisions for support/anchoring or foundation systems that, when properly designed
and installed, will resist overturning and lateral movement (sliding) of the manufactured home as imposed by the
respective design loads. For Wind Zone I, the design wind loads to be used for calculating resistance to overturning
and lateral movement shall be the simultaneous application of the wind loads indicated in &sect;3280.305(c)(1)(i),
increased by a factor of 1.5. The 1.5 factor of safety for Wind Zone I is also to be applied simultaneously to both the
vertical building projection, as horizontal wind load, and across the surface of the full roof structure, as uplift
loading. For Wind Zones II and III, the resistance shall be determined by the simultaneous application of the horizontal
drag and uplift wind loads, in accordance with &sect;3280.305(c)(1)(ii). The basic allowable stresses of materials
required to resist overturning and lateral movement shall not be increased in the design and proportioning of these
members. No additional shape or location factors need to be applied in the design of the tiedown system. The dead load
of the structure may be used to resist these wind loading effects in all Wind Zones.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 102 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 provides that no State shall provide for
(and no person shall collect, directly or indirectly) a greater allowance for the processing of milk (``make allowance'')
than is permitted under a Federal program to establish a Grade A price for manufacturing butter, nonfat dry milk, or
cheese. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 1, 1993, a supplemental proposed rule was published to implement section 102. A supplemental proposed
rule was deemed necessary because of (1) comments received on the original proposed rule published on June 19, 1992,
and (2) regulations issued by the Agricultural Marketing Service concerning the pricing of milk used to produce nonfat
dry milk after the publication of the original proposed rule for section 102. The supplemental proposed rule specified
that all comments had to be received by January 31, 1994, in order to be assured of consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests have been received from interested parties who indicate that they need additional time to prepare an analysis
of the supplemental proposed rule. Based upon our review of those requests, it has been determined that an additional
60 days will be allowed for comment. Accordingly, comments on the proposed rule must now be received by April 1, 1994,
in order to be assured of consideration.

Summary:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its direct operating (OL), farm ownership (FO), soil and
water (SW) and emergency (EM) loan making and servicing regulations to modify collateral requirements. These amendments
concern the amount of collateral required when an FmHA loan is made. There will be no change in security requirements
for loan restructuring. The intended effect is to reduce the burden on farmers and FmHA personnel in servicing FmHA
loan collateral and to avoid encumbering all of a farmer's collateral, thereby making it less difficult for farmers
who receive FmHA loans to subsequently obtain non-FmHA credit.

We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and we have determined that it is not a
``significant regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this
proposed rule: (1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a
material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or
otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not alter the budgetary impact of
entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) would
not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set
forth in Executive Order 12866.

Discussion of Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts
shall be published for comment not withstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. FmHA is publishing
this proposed rule with a 15-day comment period. This proposed rule relieves the restriction of taking a lien on all
assets at the time of loan making. Furthermore, the Agency has concluded that the need to provide immediate assistance
to farmers who have suffered severe production and physical losses as a result of natural disasters also justifies
the shortened comment period under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major agricultural disasters during the 1993 crop year, including extensive flooding and rainfall in 9 Midwestern
States and drought in 3 Southeastern States will result in a significant increase in demand for FmHA direct loan assistance.
Requests will not be limited to emergency loan applications. In the 9 flood states alone, over 8 million acres of crops
were lost or not planted in 1993. Estimates indicate that the 1993 floods were the second costliest weather disaster
in the history of the United States. Preliminary estimates are that as many as 10,000 of the affected farmers may require
financial assistance from FmHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Frequently, other lenders are willing to provide part of the farmers' credit needs, in combination with some FmHA
assistance. However,

the existing FmHA loan security requirements would preclude many lenders from continuing to provide credit to these
farmers. FmHA does not have the staff or financial resources to cope with this situation without participation from
private sector lenders. The need for a change in the regulations is immediate. Most farmers are now concluding 1993
operations, consulting with their lenders, and planning for 1994. FmHA is receiving loan requests at an increasing
rate. The Agency wants to give the public an opportunity for input on the proposed change but FmHA needs regulations
in place for spring planting, so a reasonable compromise was the 15-day comment period. Because of the scope of the
situation and the impact on local, regional, and national economies, the Agency believes that an amendment to the
regulations after a shortened comment period is the only way to assure that affected farmers receive the assistance
they need on a timely basis to recover from these disasters. Any further delay in the timing of this amendment will reduce
the Agency's ability to meet the needs of those affected, thus imposing additional hardships on those who have already
suffered substantially from flood or drought, and jeopardizing individual and community financial recovery from
these disasters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1989, the General Accounting Office (GAO) submitted a report (GAO/RCED&hyph;89&hyph;9) to the Senate Committee
on Agriculture addressing FmHA's loan making policies and practices. One of the concerns noted was FmHA's eroding
security position on many loans and the significant dollar losses being projected (and realized). One of GAO's recommendations
addressed the need for a change in FmHA collateral requirements. The report recommended additional security be taken
when servicing loans, including obtaining the best security interest available on all of the borrower's assets.
In an effort to reduce loan losses and protect the public interest, FmHA published a proposed rule on February 15, 1991,
requiring a lien on all assets when loans are made. A final rule implementing this policy was published on April 30,
1992. On April 30, 1992, the Agency also published an interim rule requiring a lien on all a borrower's assets when loans
are restructured. This policy had been issued as a proposed rule on October 23, 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement for a lien on all assets at the time a loan is made was intended to assure that FmHA had a security interest
in all of a borrower's property, reducing the potential for program abuse and loan losses. However, this policy has
proven unwieldy, imposing an excessive burden on FmHA borrowers and requiring an excessive amount of FmHA staff time.
When FmHA acquires a security interest in property owned by a borrower, that security must be serviced in accordance
with all FmHA regulations applying to the type of security property involved, regardless of the purpose of the loan.
For example, under existing regulations, the recipient of an FmHA FO loan must pledge not only real estate, but all
chattel property as well to secure the loan. The borrower must account to FmHA for all farm products sold, even though
FmHA's primary interest in the sale is for payment of the FO loan installment coming due, not the disposition of loan
security. This requirement imposes a major burden on borrowers, especially on those who sell farm products on a frequent
basis. Also, FmHA employees must spend a significant amount of time completing the necessary documentation for release
of its security interest for such sales. This time is a precious resource that the Agency believes would be better spent
providing advice and counsel to those borrowers under the most severe hardship who could benefit most from FmHA credit
supervision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the exceptions to FmHA's blanket lien requirement is that a lien will not be taken on chattel security when it
will prevent the applicant from obtaining operating credit from other sources. This exception does not adequately
correct the problems experienced with the lien on all assets rule. FmHA officials sometimes determine this exception
is not necessary at the time the loan is made. However, taking a lien can later interfere with a borrower's ability to
obtain credit from other sources, when borrowers have sufficient equity in assets to qualify for a non-FmHA loan to
meet a portion of their credit needs. The Agency can subordinate or release liens on security property to facilitate
credit from other lenders. However, these actions also impose a processing burden on borrowers and require staff
time. Further, the Agency has found that some lenders shy away from providing credit to such borrowers due to the time
and paperwork involved, even though the borrower otherwise meets the lender's loan criteria. The only recourse for
the borrower to meet his or her credit needs is to request FmHA assistance. Thus, the lien on all assets requirement
forces those borrowers who would otherwise not have a need for FmHA credit to consume resources which would be more
appropriately directed toward borrowers in greater difficulty. Devoting more attention to those borrowers who
desperately need intensive financial assistance and the time of FmHA staff should reduce the failure rate of these
borrowers, thereby reducing program costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this proposed rule is to make the loan security requirements less demanding while continuing to protect
the Government's interest. The Agency will continue to make loans provided the value of the security available is
at least equal to the amount of the loan. This is consistent with the authorizing statute and the Agency's mission of
providing assistance to farmers with limited financial resources. However, rather than requiring a lien on all a
borrower's additional assets, if any, when making a loan, FmHA generally will only require a lien on property only
to the point that the value of the security is at least equal to 150 percent of the amount of the loan. The Agency has determined
that security at least equal to 150 percent of the loan amount will provide adequate assurance of repayment. Studies
have indicated that loan liquidation costs are about 20 percent of the value of collateral. Additionally, the Agency
has a funding cost as a result of monies borrowed from the Treasury in accordance with the Federal Credit Reform Act
of 1990, which continues until the loan is paid or written off. This cost is difficult to estimate because interest
rates and liquidation periods vary widely. However, this cost should be no more than 30 percent of the loan amount on
the average. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Obtaining security at least equal to 150 percent of the loan amount is a goal. Generally, the Agency will be unable to
obtain security exactly meeting the 150 percent goal. Security in excess of 150 percent of the loan will only be taken
when it is not practicable to separate the property, i.e., a tract of land, same type of livestock (dairy cows, brood
sows), and when nonessential assets are taken as security for EM loans, as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first security preference for operating type loans will be crops/chattels, and for real estate type loans the
first priority will be real estate. Where there are several collateral possibilities for chattels (cattle, machinery)
or real estate (different tracts of land), the FmHA loan approval official will select the most reasonable choice
to reach the 150 percent collateral goal. If the applicant offers an acceptable alternative, the loan approval official
will accept the applicant's choice. Because of this change, entity members no longer need to pledge their assets as
collateral. Entity members still will be personally obligated on the loan note(s). The Agency proposes to amend 7
CFR part 1941, subpart A, &sect;1941.19; part 1943, subpart A, &sect;1943.19; part 1943, subpart B, &sect;1943.69;
and part 1945, subpart D, &sect;1945.169 to incorporate these changes. All loan making regulations are being changed
because most applicants affected by disasters apply for various types of farm loans and the changes are needed for
administrative consistency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also proposes to amend 7 CFR part 1943, subpart A, &sect;1943.19 to state that chattel property will be taken
as security for real estate loans only in certain situations. For the reasons discussed earlier with regard to burdensome
chattel security servicing requirements and reduced availability of conventional credit, farm ownership (FO)
loans will not be secured with chattels unless there is no other real estate available to provide security at least
equal to the loan amount, or unless the chattels are real estate improvements (fixtures) made with FO funds. Generally,
real estate values are more constant than chattel values and provide adequate loan security. Chattel security is
not desirable on long term real estate loans due to servicing difficulties and rapid depreciation. Because of the
limited circumstances in which certain chattel security will be taken on real estate loans, the exception for when
title to a livestock or crop enterprise is held by a contractor or under a share lease agreement is no longer needed.
The exception to taking a lien, therefore, is being removed from subparts A and B and part 1943. To clarify the existing
policy and to assure that all possibilities are considered when the available loan security is not at least equal to
the loan amount, 7 CFR part 1943, subpart A, &sect;1943.19, along with 7 CFR part 1941, subpart A, &sect;1941.19; 7
CFR part 1943, subpart B, &sect;1943.69; and 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D, &sect;1945.169, are revised to specifically
state that in situations where the farmer does not or will not have adequate real estate or chattel property to secure
the loan needed, other property, including real estate owned by a third party, can serve as security. A pledge of security
is preferable to a cosigner. 7 CFR part 1943, subpart A, &sect;1943.19, 7 CFR part 1943, subpart B, &sect;1943.69,
and 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D, &sect;1945.169 will be revised accordingly. This policy already is stated in existing
7 CFR part 1941, subpart A, &sect;1941.19.

The Agency also proposes to amend 7 CFR part 1945, subpart D, &sect;1945.169 to add a provision regarding nonessential
assets in EM loan situations. In many cases, EM loan applicants are not typical FmHA loan applicants in that they may
have significant nonfarm asset holdings. Prior to April 30, 1992, FmHA had required EM loan applicants to liquidate
nonessential assets prior to loan closing if possible, on the theory that the applicant's equity in these assets should
be used to reduce Government subsidized credit needs. This policy proved to impose hardship on farmers already suffering
from the affects of a disaster, with minimal results. In many cases, the assets in question could not be sold for the
estimated value, and thus no equity was realized. In other cases, the assets were not readily liquidated, and loan
recipients were forced to accept much less than true value, or unable to liquidate the assets at any price within the
necessary timeframe. As a result of these difficulties, FmHA modified this policy and amended the regulations to
require a lien on, rather than a sale of, such assets. A lien on all nonessential assets (with no 150% limit) assures
the Agency that the equity will be applied to reducing the farmer's Federally subsidized credit when nonessential
assets are sold. On this basis, the requirement for a lien on all nonessential assets in the case of EM loans is continued
even though the requirement for a lien on all farm assets is substantially modified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Agency has amended 7 CFR part 1951, subpart S, &sect;1951.910. The requirement that liens will be taken
on all assets when loans are restructured will be continued to protect against potential loan losses as a result of
extended repayment terms. The Agency proposes to continue this action since a significant amount of debt has been
written off over the years, the Agency continues to have a large number of financially stressed high-risk borrowers,
and to comply with the GAO report discussed previously in this rule. This section had previously referred to the loan
making regulations to prescribe the security requirements for loan restructuring. Since the requirements for loan
making will now be different from loan servicing, it is necessary to insert the guidelines into the debt restructuring
regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each EM loan will be secured by chattels, real estate, and/or other security and nonessential assets in accordance
with this section. The same collateral may be used to secure two or more loans made, direct or guaranteed, to the same
borrower. Thus, a junior lien on property serving as collateral for a guaranteed loan(s) is acceptable.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Security for operating type purposes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the case of emergency loans made for subtitle B (operating) purposes, primary security must be available for the
loan, except as provided for in &sect;1945.169 (e)(2) of this section. If available, the total amount of security
required will be at least equal to 150 percent of the loan amount. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section,
security in excess of 150 percent of the loan amount will only be taken when it is not practicable to separate the property,
i.e., same type of livestock (dairy cows, brood sows). In unusual cases, the loan approval official may require a cosigner
as defined in &sect;1910.3 (d) of subpart A of part 1910 of this chapter, or a pledge of security from a third party. A
pledge of security is preferable to a cosigner.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Chattels. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The loan must be secured by: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A first lien on all property or products acquired, produced, or refinanced with loan funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the security for the loan under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section is not at least equal to 150 percent of the
loan amount, the best lien obtainable will be taken on other chattel security owned by the applicant, up to the point
that security for the loan at least equals 150 percent of the loan amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) When there are several alternatives available (cattle, machinery), any one of which will meet the security requirements
of this section, the approval official will select the most logical and efficient alternative for obtaining security.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) When alternatives exist and the applicant has a preference as to the property to be taken for security, the approval
official will honor the preference so long as the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section are
met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Real estate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The loan approval official will require a lien on all or part of the applicant's real estate as security when chattel
security alone is not at least equal to 150 percent of the amount of the loan. Different lien positions on real estate
are considered separate and identifiable collateral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other security. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A pledge of real estate or chattels by a third party may be taken as security when the property owned by the applicant
is not adequate to secure the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Other property that cannot be converted to cash without jeopardizing the applicant's farm operation or imposing
substantial financial penalty on the applicant may be taken as additional security when the property owned by the
applicant is not adequate to secure the loan. Examples of such security include but are not limited to cash surrender
value of life insurance, securities, patents and copyrights, and membership or stock in cooperatives and associations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Security for real estate type purposes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EM loans made for subtitle A (real estate) purposes will be secured by real estate. Chattels and/or other security
also may be taken as security. The total amount of security required will be the lesser of 150 percent of the loan amount,
or all real estate owned by the applicant. A loan will be considered adequately secured when the real estate security
for the loan is at least equal to the loan amount, except as provided for in &sect;1945.169(e)(2) of this section. Except
as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, security in excess of 150 percent of the loan amount will only be taken
when it is not practicable to separate the property, i.e., a tract of land. In unusual cases, the loan approval official
may require a cosigner as defined in &sect;1910.3(d) of subpart A of part 1910 of this chapter, or a pledge of security
from someone other than the applicant(s). A pledge of security is preferable to a cosigner.

(i) A mortgage will be taken on all real estate repaired or rehabilitated, refinanced, or improved with EM funds, and
by any additional real estate security needed to meet the requirements of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Security will also include assignments of leases or leasehold interests which have mortgageable value, water
rights, easements, rights of way, mineral rights, and royalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A first lien is required on real estate, when available. Loans may be secured by a junior lien on real estate provided:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(A) Prior lien instruments do not contain provisions for future advances (except for taxes, insurance, and other
costs needed to protect the security, or reasonable foreclosure costs), cancellation, summary forfeiture, or other
clauses that may jeopardize the Government's interest or the applicant's ability to pay the loan unless any such undesirable
provision is waived, modified, or subordinated insofar as the Government is concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Agreements are obtained from prior lienholders to give notice of foreclosure to FmHA whenever State law or other
arrangements do not require such a notice. Any agreements needed will be obtained as provided in subpart B of part 1927
of this chapter, except as modified by the ``Memorandum of Understanding-FCA-FmHA,'' FmHA Instruction 2000&hyph;R
(available in any FmHA office). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Chattel security. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Loans will be secured by chattels as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A first lien will be taken on equipment or fixtures purchased or refinanced with loan funds whenever such property
cannot be included in the real estate lien and the additional security is needed to secure the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Chattel security will be obtained when there is not enough real estate security for the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The same collateral may be used to secure two or more loans made, direct or guaranteed, to the same borrower. Therefore,
junior liens on chattels may be taken when there is enough equity in the property. However, when possible, a first lien
on selected chattel items should be obtained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Chattel security liens will be obtained and kept effective, as provided in subpart A of part 1962 of this chapter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other security. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A pledge of real estate by a third party may be taken as security when the real estate owned and to be acquired by the
applicant is not adequate to secure the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Other property may be taken as additional security when the real estate owned and to be acquired by the applicant
is not adequate to secure the loan. Examples of such security include but are not limited to cash surrender value of
life insurance, securities, patents and copyrights, and membership or stock in cooperatives and associations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Nonessential assets. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nonessential assets are assets which the applicant has an ownership interest in that do not contribute a net income
to pay family living expenses or to maintain a sound farming operation (see &sect;1962.17 of subpart A of part 1962
of this chapter for further guidance). A lien will be taken on all nonessential assets if an applicant cannot or will
not dispose of the assets and use the proceeds to reduce the FmHA credit needs prior to loan closing. The 150 percent
security requirement does not apply to nonessential assets.

Lien on certain assets. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Delinquent borrowers must pledge certain assets, essential and nonessential, unencumbered to FmHA as security
at the time FmHA loans are restructured, as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The best lien obtainable will be taken on all assets owned by the borrower. When the borrower is an entity, the best
lien obtainable will be taken on all assets owned by the entity, and all assets owned by all members of the entity. Different
lien positions on real estate are considered separate and identifiable collateral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Security will include, but is not limited to, the following: land, buildings, structures, fixtures, machinery,
equipment, livestock, livestock products, growing crops, stored crops, inventory, supplies, accounts receivable,
certain cash or special cash collateral accounts, marketable securities, certificates of ownership of precious
metals, and cash surrender value of life insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Security will also include assignments of leases or leasehold interests having mortgageable value, revenues,
royalties from mineral rights, patents and copyrights, and pledges of security by third parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The exceptions set forth in &sect;1941.19(c) of subpart A of part 1941 apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) These assets will be considered as additional security for the loans as well as any shared appreciation agreement.
The value of the essential assets will not be included in the NRV calculation to determine restructure. The FmHA lien
will be taken only at the time of closing the restructured FmHA loans.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are proposing to amend the brucellosis regulations to eliminate the requirement that States maintain specified
Market Cattle Identification (MCI) reactor prevalence rates to maintain their official classifications. We are
proposing instead to require the States to successfully close (epidemiologically investigate and resolve) certain
percentages of cases detected through the MCI program. We believe these amendments would better serve Federal and
State animal health officials in their efforts to prevent the interstate spread of brucellosis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Brucellosis is an infectious disease of certain animals and humans. In its principal animal hosts, it is characterized
by abortion and impaired fertility. Through a cooperative Federal-State effort, the United States is now approaching
total eradication of the field strain 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brucella abortus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in domestic cattle and bison herds. As of May 1993, there were only 337 known infected cattle and bison herds, and the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had declared 32 States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands free of the
disease. Fewer than 500 new infected herds were identified last year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 78 (referred to below as the regulations) govern the interstate movement of cattle, bison,
and swine to prevent the spread of brucellosis. Section 78.1 defines the terms used in the regulations. In accordance
with &sect;78.1, States and areas can be classified as Class Free, Class A, Class B, or Class C. These terms refer to
stages of the eradication process as determined by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
and State animal health officials. Class Free States and areas are considered to be free of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brucella abortus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in all domestic livestock, and Class C States and areas have the highest levels of brucellosis infection. Section
78.1 sets forth the standards States or areas must meet to achieve and maintain each of the classifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One standard for classification is the Market Cattle Identification (MCI) reactor prevalence rate. Under the MCI
program, slaughtering establishments must collect blood samples from 95 percent of all cows and bulls 2 years of age
and older (known as MCI test cattle). The samples are then subjected to an official brucellosis test. Animals that
have serologically positive results to the official brucellosis test administered under the MCI program are MCI
reactors. The regulations require animal health officials to trace MCI reactors to the farm of origin and conduct
an epidemiologic investigation, to evaluate the risk that brucellosis could spread from the farm of origin. Class
Free and Class A States and areas must trace at least 90 percent of all MCI reactors to the farm of origin, and Class B and
Class C States and areas must trace at least 80 percent to the farm of origin. When required by the results of the epidemiologic
investigation, herd blood tests must be conducted or the herds must be confined to the premises under quarantine.
Examples of when herd testing or quarantine may not be necessary include cases where epidemiologic investigation
reveals the MCI reactor results were not caused by field strains of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brucella
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or that the herd has been or will be sent to slaughter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MCI reactor prevalence rate is the rate of infection in a State or area's cattle population based on the percentage
of MCI reactors found in the total number of MCI tested cattle. Under the regulations, Class Free States and areas must
maintain a 12-consecutive-month MCI reactor prevalence rate not to exceed 0.050 percent. For Class A States and areas,
the rate must not exceed 0.10 percent, and for Class B States and areas, the rate must not exceed 0.30 percent. Class
C States and areas have an MCI reactor prevalence rate that exceeds 0.30 percent. Class Free, Class A, and Class B States
and areas that exceed the required percentages may be reclassified to a lower classification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tests used to identify MCI reactors detect not only serum titers caused by brucellosis infection but also serum titers
caused by certain other organisms and by vaccination. As a result of such spurious titers, an estimate of brucellosis
prevalence based solely on the MCI reactor prevalence rate in a State or area would overestimate the rate of brucellosis
infection. Nevertheless, the MCI reactor data has been helpful to Federal and State animal health officials who use
the rates of the individual States and areas to reveal trends and to compare their progress in eradicating brucellosis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the United States had thousands of infected herds, we did not consider the effect of spurious titers on the States'
and areas' MCI reactor prevalence rates to be significant. However, as the level of brucellosis infection in this
country has declined, the proportion of spurious titers in the MCI reactor prevalence rates has increased. As a result,
in Class Free States and areas, the MCI reactor prevalence rate may consist entirely of spurious titers. Therefore,
we no longer believe a State or area's MCI reactor prevalence rate is a good indication of its eradication progress,
and we are proposing to eliminate the requirement in the regulations that States and areas meet specific MCI reactor
prevalence rates to maintain their official classifications.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If States no longer need to meet specific MCI reactor prevalence rates, we believe it is even more important for the
States to concentrate on the activities required following identification of an MCI reactor (tracebacks, epidemiologic
investigations, and, usually, herd testing or quarantine). The epidemiologic investigation and herd testing can
reveal whether an MCI reaction is a spurious titer or a valid indication of brucellosis. If herd testing reveals one
or more animals that test positive to the official test for brucellosis (brucellosis reactors), all other animals
in the herd are considered brucellosis exposed. Brucellosis reactor cattle and brucellosis exposed cattle may move
interstate only in accordance with subpart B of part 78 (&sect;&sect;78.5 through 78.14), to control the spread of
brucellosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a herd is quarantined in lieu of testing following epidemiologic investigation of an MCI reactor herd, the quarantine
protects against the possibility that the herd may be infected and could spread brucellosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Herd testing or quarantine only occur for MCI reactor cases that are ``successfully closed'' (defined below). The
larger the number of MCI reactor cases that are not successfully closed, the greater the possibility that brucellosis
could spread from herds associated with the uninvestigated MCI reactors. Therefore, we are proposing to require
that a minimum percentage of MCI reactor cases must be successfully closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We would consider MCI reactor cases that have been traced to the farm of origin to be successfully closed when: (1) An
epidemiologic investigation is completed within specified time limits; and (2) the herd is tested, or State or APHIS
animal health officials confine the animals to their premises under quarantine; or (3) State or APHIS animal health
officials determine there is justification for not testing the herd or quarantining it. We propose to add to &sect;78.1
a definition of ``successfully closed case'' that reflects this standard for successful closure.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For Class Free and Class A States, animal health officials would have to complete the epidemiologic investigation
within 15 days after they are notified by the cooperative State-Federal laboratory that brucellosis reactors were
found on an MCI test. For Class B and Class C States, the time limit would be 30 days. This time standard for completing
the epidemiologic investigation is the same standard required in the current regulations. Experience with brucellosis
program operations has shown the time limits to be long enough to be workable for animal health officials, and short
enough to support effective controls on the spread of brucellosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe there are circumstances that would constitute acceptable justification for not testing or quarantining
a herd following an MCI reactor traceback. The current regulations merely state that herd testing or quarantine will
be employed ``[W]hen required by the results of the epidemiologic investigation.'' We would like to provide more
specific guidance concerning when it would be justified to forego herd testing or quarantine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are proposing to require that herd blood tests be conducted or the herd be confined to the premises under quarantine
within 30 days after notification that brucellosis reactors were found on the MCI test, unless a designated epidemiologist
determines that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The brucellosis reactor is located in a herd in a different State than the State where the MCI blood sample was collected.
In such cases a State representative or APHIS representative must give written notice of the MCI test results to the
State animal health official in the State where the brucellosis reactor is located; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Evidence indicates that the brucellosis reactor is from a herd that no longer presents a risk of spreading brucellosis,
or is from a herd that is unlikely to be infected with brucellosis. Such evidence could include, but is not limited to,
situations where: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The brucellosis reactor is traced back to a herd that has been sold for slaughter in entirety. In this case, the potential
for the herd to spread brucellosis no longer exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The brucellosis reactor is traced back to a herd that is certified brucellosis free and is 100-percent vaccinated.
In such cases it is probable that the MCI test was a false positive, due to a titer caused by the vaccine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The brucellosis reactor showed a low titer on the MCI test and is traced back to a dairy herd that is 100 percent vaccinated
and has tested negative to the most recent brucellosis ring test required by the regulations. This is another case
where the probability of a false positive or other error in the MCI test is far greater than the probability that the
herd of origin is affected by brucellosis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Animal health officials could report a traceback to a farm of origin in another State as a successfully closed case
because we do not expect animal health officials to conduct epidemiologic investigations and herd testing in another
State. However, as part of successfully closing the case we would require them to notify in writing the State animal
health official in the State where the farm of origin is located so officials in that State could take proper follow-up
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, Class Free and Class A States and areas would need to successfully close at least 95 percent of
the MCI reactor cases traced to the farm of origin, and Class B and Class C States and areas would need to successfully
close at least 90 percent of such cases. This means that 1 in 20 MCI reactor cases could be left unclosed in Class Free
and Class A States, and 1 in 10 reactor cases could be left unclosed in Class B and Class C States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If adopted, this proposal would reduce current recordkeeping requirements for the States. While State officials
would still need to compile data, the time involved should be much less than what is currently required for computing
the MCI reactor prevalence rate. Under our proposal, States would focus their recordkeeping on a fairly small number
of MCI reactors, rather than the much larger number of cattle with negative MCI test results. States would no longer
need to count all cattle tested, separate out cattle from other States, and then calculate an MCI reactor prevalence
rate based on the number of their State's cattle that were tested and the number of MCI reactors found through such testing.
Instead, each State would need to include in its annual report to APHIS the percentage of MCI reactor cases it successfully
closes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the
Department, we have determined that this proposed rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition,
jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only State animal health agencies would be affected by this proposed rule; it would have no effect on the private sector.
State animal health officials would need to provide information on only the MCI reactors detected each month instead
of total numbers of MCI test cattle slaughtered. They would also need to maintain records of the numbers of MCI reactor
cases that are successfully closed and report the percentage of successfully closed cases annually to APHIS. The
States are already required to carry out the activities that constitute successful case closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to modify the current Class D airspace and to establish a Class E extension to the Class D surface
area at Roswell, NM. This action proposes to amend a previous airspace action that established a 14.8 NM Class D airspace
extension to the Class D surface area for Roswell, NM. Because the arrival extension is greater than two miles, it should
have been classified as Class E airspace. However, it was incorrectly classified as Class D airspace. The intended
effect of this proposal is to reclassify a portion of the current Class D airspace extension at Roswell, NM to a class
E airspace extension to contain instrument approach procedures and to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain
IFR operations and require two-way radio communications at Roswell Industrial Air Center.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class D
airspace at Roswell, NM. The current Class D airspace at Roswell Industrial Air Center, NM, was modified by rulemaking
action dated December 12, 1993 (58 FR 63885). That modification included an extension of the Class D airspace within
3.7 miles each side of the Chisum Very High Omni-Directional Radio Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) 290
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; radial extending from the 5.0-mile radius to 14.8 miles northwest of the airport. That extension to the Class
D airpace in excess of 2 nautical miles should have been classified as Class E airspace. The intended effect of this
proposal is to reclassify a portion of the current Class D airspace extension at Roswell, NM to a Class E airspace extension
to contain instrument approach procedures and to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain IFR operations and
require two-way radio communications at Roswell Industrial Air Center.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published
in Paragraph 5000 and Class E airspace areas designated as extensions to Class D surface areas are published in Paragraph
6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document would
be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
that need frequent and routine amendments to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) proposes to amend its regulations establishing fees to be assessed in connection
with the search for records and provision of documents by the Board. The proposed rule increases some of the fees based
on updates of estimates of direct costs to the Board of providing these services and adds a fee for transmittal of documents
by other than regular mail.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Title 5 U.S.C. 552(a) requires the promulgation of a regulation specifying the schedule of fees applicable to the
processing of requests for information. These fees are to provide for the recovery of the direct costs of search, duplication,
and review. The fees currently provided for in &sect;200.4(g)(1) no longer reflect the actual costs of processing
requests for information and do not include fees for specific methods of transmittal of documents. Consequently,
the Board proposes to increase these fees presently found in &sect;200.4(g) and to add a new paragraph to provide a
charge for transmittal of documents by other than regular post.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has determined that this is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291. Therefore, no regulatory impact
analysis is required. There are no information collections associated with this proposed rule within the meaning
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The penalty charge shall accrue from the date on which the debt became delinquent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A debt is delinquent if it has not been paid in full by the 30th day after the date on which the initial demand letter
was first mailed or hand-delivered, or, if the debt is being repaid under an installment payment agreement, at any
time after the debtor fails to satisfy his or her obligation for payment thereunder.

Section 12(o) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides that benefits payable to an employee with respect
to days of sickness shall be payable regardless of the liability of any person to pay damages for such infirmity. The
Board shall be entitled to reimbursement from any sum or damages paid or payable to such employee or other person through
suits, compromise, settlement, judgment, or otherwise on account of any liability (other than a liability under
health, sickness, accident, or similar insurance policy) based upon such infirmity, to the extent that it will have
paid or will pay benefits for days of sickness resulting from such infirmity. Upon notice to the person against whom
such right or claim exists or is asserted, the Board shall have a lien upon such right or claim, any judgment obtained
thereunder, and any sum or damages paid under such right or claim, to the extent of the amount to which the Board is entitled
by way of reimbursement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 341.6 of the Board's regulations provides that a person or company subject to the lien must notify the agency
within five days of a settlement or judgment and must pay the agency the amount withheld to satisfy the lien within 30
days. In the case where a lien arises in favor of the Board as a result of a settlement or judgment but the Board is not notified
of the settlement or judgment in a timely manner, the employer or third party who has been served with a Notice of Lien
and notice of the amount of that lien already has notice of the existence and amount of the debt. Accordingly, interest
should accrue from the date of settlement or judgment, but would be waived if paid within 30 days in accordance with
&sect;200.7(g)(1) of the Board's regulations.

Likewise, a section 12(o) debt should be considered delinquent if the lien is not satisfied within 30 days after settlement
or entry of judgment.

Consequently, the Board proposes to amend &sect;200.7 of its regulations to provide for the accrual of interest on
section 12(o) debts and for the accrual of penalties on such debts when they become delinquent.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 20, 1990 (55 FR 25204 at 25232), FDA proposed talc, 45 to 100 percent, as Category I (generally recognized as
safe and effective and not misbranded) as an OTC skin protectant active ingredient for the treatment and prevention
of diaper rash. Specific warnings and directions were proposed for powder products containing talc. The final monograph
for OTC skin protectant drug products will be published in a future issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The discussion of talc at these public meetings may be considered by the agency in the preparation of this final monograph
for OTC skin protectant drug products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of these meetings is to provide a forum for an updated discussion of the origins, manufacture, characterization,
toxicology, and epidemiology of talc and related products. The principal focus will be on the latest toxicologic
and epidemiologic studies, particularly as they reflect on the safe uses of talc in consumer products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following topic areas will be discussed: (1) Characteristics of cosmetic-grade talc; (2) a history of the uses
of talc in a variety of consumer products; (3) current quality control measures to insure safety; (4) the regulatory
history of talc; (5) recent National Toxicology Program studies of chronic pulmonary exposure of rodents to talc
and the relevance of these studies to human risk assessment; and (6) the significance of contrasting epidemiologic
studies of talc exposure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Speakers and panelists will include well-known regulatory specialists, toxicologists, epidemiologists, pathologists,
talc product manufacturers, talc production experts, and consumer representatives. A critical panel discussion
by speakers and invited experts will complete each session.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2002 of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), Highway Safety Programs,
requires that the uniform guidelines for State Highway Safety Programs include six critical programs. The existing
18 Highway Safety Program Guidelines currently address four of the six programs identified in ISTEA, but do not specifically
address Speed Control or Occupant Protection. The agencies therefore propose to amend the regulations by adopting
guidelines for these two programs. The agencies also propose to issue a guideline on Roadway Safety, corresponding
to the Roadway Safety Priority Program Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to three new guidelines, the agencies propose to revise six of the existing 18 guidelines to reflect new
issues and to emphasize program methodology and approaches which have proven to be especially successful in these
program areas. The guidelines the agencies propose to revise are as follows:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 402 of the Highway Safety Act of 1966 directed the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate uniform standards
for State highway safety programs, specified the subjects of several standards, and required States to conform to
these uniform standards or risk losing portions of their Federal-aid highway funds. Between 1967 and 1972, the Secretary
promulgated 18 Uniform Standards for State Highway Safety Programs (published at 23 CFR part 1204).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until 1976, the section 402 program was principally directed at achieving State and local conformance with the 18
Highway Safety Program Standards, which were considered mandatory requirements with financial sanctions available
for non-compliance. In 1976, Congress provided for a more flexible implementation of the program so that the Secretary
would not have to require State compliance with every uniform standard or with each element of every uniform standard.
As a result, the standards became guidelines for use by the States. Management of the program shifted from one focused
upon enforcing program standards to one focused upon problem identification, countermeasure development and evaluation,
with the standards to be used as a framework for the State programs. Few changes have been made in the guidelines since
that time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 2002 of ISTEA, Highway Safety Programs, requires that the uniform guidelines for State Highway Safety Programs
include programs: (1) To reduce injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicles being driven in excess of the posted
speed limits; (2) to encourage the proper use of occupant protection devices (including the use of safety belts and
child restraint systems) by occupants of motor vehicles and to increase public awareness of the benefit of motor vehicles
equipped with airbags; (3) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from persons driving motor vehicles while impaired
by alcohol or a controlled substance; (4) to reduce deaths and injuries resulting from crashes involving motor vehicles
and motorcycles; (5) to reduce injuries and deaths resulting from crashes involving school buses; and (6) to improve
law enforcement services in motor vehicle accident prevention, traffic supervision, and post-accident procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four of the areas represented by these six guidelines (i.e., Impaired Driving, Occupant Protection, Motorcycle
Safety, and Police Traffic Services) have previously been identified as National Priority Program Areas (under
23 CFR part 1205). Other Priority Areas include Emergency Medical Services, Pedestrian/Bicycle Safety, Traffic
Records, and Roadway Safety. Although Speed Control and School Bus Safety are not currently Priority Areas, the agencies
are now engaged in another rulemaking action and in a separate notice in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 are considering whether to amend 23 CFR part 1205 to include Speed Control and/or School Buses as National Priority
Program Areas. Further, the Guideline for Pupil Transportation was revised in April of 1991 and needs no further revision
at this time. In addition, section 4002 of ISTEA requires that State agencies which receive Motor Carrier Safety Assistance
Program (MCSAP) grants coordinate their respective commercial motor vehicle (CMV) safety enforcement plans with
the State highway safety agency (49 CFR 350). FHWA administers the MCSAP.

Under MCSAP, States conduct uniform inspections of commercial motor vehicles at roadside sites and perform safety
reviews of carriers to check for compliance with safety and hazardous materials regulations. Under the ISTEA, MCSAP
was expanded to include additional safety activities, such as traffic enforcement, impaired driving initiatives,
uniform truck and bus accident reporting, vehicle weight enforcement, training for hazardous materials enforcements,
Commercial Drivers License (CDL) enforcement, research and development, public education, and drug interdiction
efforts. Information on CMV inspections and crashes is collected by the States and transmitted electronically to
FHWA's mainframe through the SAFETYNET system. Since all States have access to SAFETYNET, information on the system
can be valuable in identifying problems and improving traffic safety. The agencies encourage States to coordinate
their section 402 plans and activities with MCSAP where appropriate in order to maximize benefits to both programs.

The existing 18 Highway Safety Program Guidelines currently address four of the six programs identified in ISTEA;
they do not specifically address Speed Control or Occupant Protection. Therefore, the agencies propose to issue
two new guidelines: Highway Safety Program Guideline No. 19, Speed Control; and Highway Safety Program Guideline
No. 20, Occupant Protection. Though Speed Control has always been a component of the Police Traffic Services Priority
Area, it requires special attention in light of the involvement of speed in many traffic crashes. The agencies also
intend to take this opportunity to propose issuance of one additional guideline, which would be identified as Highway
Safety Program Guideline No. 21, Roadway Safety. The Roadway Safety Guideline is a consolidation of the key aspects
of various Guidelines which relate to the roadway. The addition of these new guidelines will result in a formal guideline
corresponding to each of the current National Priority Program Areas. Because the vast majority of all highway safety
projects funded under title 23 U.S.C. 402 are designed to address one or more of these Priority Program Areas, the existence
of corresponding guidelines for each will be of great value to the States and communities in the design and implementation
of highway safety programs.

19: Speed Control
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issue of speed control has received considerable attention by NHTSA. Over the course of the agency's history,
NHTSA has funded and promoted many programs and initiatives addressing the problem. Some common conclusions from
these programs and initiatives indicate that higher speeds and speeds too fast for conditions (whether or not travelling
in excess of the speed limit) adversely affect the safety of motorists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, Speed Control has not been separately identified as a National Priority Program Area under 23 CFR part
1204. It has, however, been an integral part of the Priority Program Area involving Police Traffic Services, resulting
in numerous programs at the State and local levels. In addition, the FHWA, through the MCSAP, supports speed control
initiatives as part of an overall traffic enforcement program aimed specifically at commercial motor vehicles.
The agencies are currently engaged in rulemaking to add Speed Control as a separate National Priority Program Area.
This proposed guideline is written to assist States and communities in the design and implementation of effective
Speed Control Programs. The guideline sets forth recommendations for the development and management of effective
speed control plans, visible public information and education efforts to gain voluntary compliance, promotion
of the use of new technology in the enforcement of speed laws, the establishment of safe and reasonable speed limits,
and effective training for police officers involved in speed control.

20: Occupant Protection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the original highway safety program standards were established by NHTSA and FHWA, an occupant protection program
was not among them. Although lap and shoulder belts have been required for front outboard positions and lap belts for
all other seating positions in all passenger cars sold in the U.S. after January 1, 1968, belt usage remained very low
through the 1970's. In 1970, under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, FHWA required drivers of commercial
motor vehicles in interstate commerce to use a safety belt if it was installed in the vehicle. During the 1980's, States
participating in MCSAP adopted this requirement for commercial motor vehicle drivers in intrastate commerce. During
the 1970's, a national Highway Safety Needs Study indicated that significant reductions in highway losses could
be achieved with increased public use of occupant protection devices. NHTSA began to explore promotional activities
to encourage the public to buckle up.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1982, the agencies issued a final rule which identified six National Priority Program Areas that were considered
the most effective in reducing highway deaths and injuries. Occupant Protection was included as one of the six most
effective programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the agencies never issued a highway safety program standard or guideline, occupant protection has remained
a National Priority Program Area. Recognition of the importance of this program increased substantially during
the 1980's with evidence that safety belts are effective in preventing death and serious injury in 40&hyph;50 percent
of all crashes; passage or upgrading of child safety seat usage laws in every State; passage of safety belt use laws
in a majority of States; major increases in funding at the Federal, State and local levels; and significant increases
in occupant protection use rates. The agencies have conducted two subsequent rulemakings to review the effectiveness
of the Priority Program Areas. No comments have been received from the public suggesting that the area of occupant
protection should be deleted from the list of National Priorities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The life-saving benefits of occupant protection programs are now widely recognized. The proposed Occupant Protection
program guideline has been prepared to provide current information on effective program elements for States to use
in producing and assessing their programs. The proposed guideline reflects the experience of States in program content
and highlights state-of-the-art knowledge in highway safety programs relating to occupant protection. The guideline
sets forth recommendations for effective management and evaluation of occupant protection programs, legislative
initiatives and employment policies mandating use of occupant protection devices, strategic efforts to enforce
use laws and policies, public information efforts to reinforce use laws or policies and to inform the public of enforcement
efforts, and education programs to promote occupant protection through various organizations including health
and medical groups, schools, and employers throughout the State.

21: Roadway Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the original 18 standards were established under the Highway Safety Act of 1966, FHWA was responsible for developing
and implementing programs relating to the roadway environment. Thus, Standards 9, 12, 13, and the roadway-related
aspects of Standard 14 (Pedestrian Safety) fell under FHWA's purview. In 1981, when FHWA and NHTSA identified six
highway safety program areas which were considered the most effective, and thus designated National Priority Program
Areas, one of the six was FHWA's Safety Construction and Operational Improvements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1987, when the agencies reviewed the effectiveness of the various programs and retained the six priority areas,
the Safety Construction and Operational Improvement Priority Program was changed to ``Roadway Safety'' to encompass
a wider breadth of safety activities which are related to the driving environment. Roadway Safety involves various
highway safety activities which relate to safety aspects of the roadway environment. Currently, many roadway safety-related
activities are described in three of the original Highway Safety Program Guidelines:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to more effectively organize and consolidate the roadway safety components from each of these various guidelines,
the agencies propose to create a new guideline entitled ``Roadway Safety''. While the four related guidelines will
remain unchanged, the new Roadway Safety Guideline highlights selected aspects from these four guidelines which
are recommended to be included in any State Roadway Safety program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The addition of these three new guidelines will ensure that guidelines reflecting the current state-of-the-art
are available for each of the National Priority Program Areas listed at 23 CFR part 1205.

Proposed Revision of Six Existing Guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the original program standards were issued in the early 1970's, much has changed in both technology and societal
behavior which affects the methodology and approach to solving highway safety problems. When the standards were
originally issued, there were no State laws requiring safety belt or child safety seat use, there was little public
awareness about drunk driving, and highway safety was not yet a matter of great public concern. Because the highway
safety environment has changed so dramatically during the past twenty years, the agencies propose to update the guidelines
to provide current information on effective program content for States to use in producing and assessing their traffic
safety programs. Each of the proposed revised guidelines reflects the experience of States in traffic safety program
content and highlights state-of-the-art knowledge in highway safety. They provide a framework for producing and
assessing a balanced highway safety program and a tool with which States can assess the effectiveness of their own
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies propose to update only those guidelines which correspond to the programs currently designated as Priority
Areas. The agencies strongly believe that focusing attention on the priority programs has the greatest impact on
highway safety. The revised guidelines will emphasize these areas of national concern and highlight the effective
countermeasures which are available, while continuing to permit States to receive funding for additional areas
of local concern when justified, and thus ensure that section 402 resources are being allocated in the most effective
manner.

Proposed Revision to Guideline No. 3_Motorcycle Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The elements of the present Motorcycle Safety Guideline No. 3 address the following safety issues: (1) Preventing
or reducing the severity of head injuries; (2) determining whether novice motorcyclists have the basic skills; and
(3) assuring that the vehicles have minimum safety equipment and are adequately maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed new Motorcycle Safety Guideline No. 3 continues to emphasize the importance of motorcyclists wearing
helmets and places great emphasis on improving the knowledge and skills of all motorcycle operators through motorcycle
rider education and training programs. The guideline also strongly encourages states and communities to develop
comprehensive motorcycle safety programs that address (1) the effective management of the program through a central
or lead agency; (2) the requirement for special licensing exams; (3) the influence of alcohol and other drugs on motorcyclists;
and (4) the issues of motorcycle conspicuity and motorist awareness.

Proposed Revision to Guideline No. 8_Alcohol in Relation to Highway Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Guideline No. 8 contains the elements which provide the basic structure underlying the drinking and driving
laws of the states. These include the use of chemical tests, the establishment of a BAC value (.10%) which is presumptive
evidence of intoxication and the enactment of laws establishing the ``implied consent'' of a motorist to submit to
a chemical test. The other components of the current guideline relate to the collection of data on alcohol-related
fatalities, and the specifications and qualifications of chemical testing equipment and personnel administering
the tests. The primary effort of the guideline was to establish some reasonable conformity with a uniform legal basis
for detecting and prosecuting drunk drivers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the current guideline, the States follow a ``specific deterrence'' approach designed to remove from the road
those who had been arrested for DWI. However, the majority of alcohol-related crashes involve drivers with no previous
DWI arrest; moreover, the majority of intoxicated drivers on the road go undetected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Guideline No. 8, entitled ``Impaired Driving'', reflects a comprehensive, community-based approach
with goals of (1) preventing people from being killed and injured in the short-term through general deterrence programs,
and (2) permanently reducing the number of drinking and drugged drivers through long-term prevention and intervention
measures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the general deterrence approach, the objective is to increase the perceived risk by the drinking driver that
he or she will be caught and convicted of DWI. The proposed guideline recommends states establish a BAC value of .08%
as the illegal per se level, at or above which a drive is considered to be driving while intoxicated; implement specific
countermeasures designed to better equip and train police officers in recognizing, tracking, and arresting impaired
drivers; enable prompt suspension of drivers licenses through streamlined administrative procedures; result
in punitive action such as fines, community service, jail or the suspension of driving privileges; and ensure the
public is fully aware of the increased enforcement efforts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the ``prevention and intervention'' approach, the guideline recommends strategies which are aimed at permanently
changing the public's attitudes and behaviors concerning drinking and driving. These include public information
and education for students in schools and colleges, for adults through programs in the workplace and for the general
population through programs in health care settings. Other education efforts include promotion of designated driver
programs, responsible alcohol service efforts, citizen support and outreach efforts, and the establishment of
self-sufficient programs requiring offenders to defray program costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The States should also be aware of and enforce alcohol and drug requirements for CMV drivers. The FHWA established
a BAC level of .04 percent as the threshold at which a CMV driver is considered to be under the influence of alcohol and
subject to disqualification from driving ranging from one year to life. In addition, a CMV driver found to have any
measurable or detectable alcohol level in his or her system while operating a CMV is prohibited from driving for 24
hours. FHWA also requires motor carriers to have specific drug testing programs of CMV drivers in place.

Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 10_Traffic Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Traffic Records Guideline is directed toward improving the operational efficiency of record systems
involving crash statistics, driver licensing, vehicle registration, vehicle inspection, traffic citations,
roadway related data, EMS, and driver education. In the past, however, the operational condition of many of these
record systems maintained by the States was insufficient to provide a reliable total information base. The growth
of the files as well as increased processing costs caused administrators to seek methods of modernizing the files
and improving compatibility of related systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Guideline No. 10 recommends methods to establish comprehensive traffic records systems to enable states
to use data to identify emerging traffic safety problems, develop appropriate countermeasures, and evaluate program
performance. The guideline focuses attention on the need to link computer systems, establish uniform data elements
including CMV crash data and integrate data elements where appropriate. In addition, the proposed guideline suggests
innovative driver licensing techniques that will effectively identify problem drivers whose driver licenses have
been suspended or revoked in other states.

Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 11_Emergency Medical Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Guideline No. 11 is based upon the philosophy that by improving pre-hospital
emergency medical services in general, the system will serve the highway-injured patient better. The focus of programs
under this guideline has been upon those elements of emergency medical care which precede the patient's arrival in
a hospital emergency department. This includes setting standards and requirements for qualified and trained personnel,
the types and number of ambulances and other emergency response vehicles, communication systems and equipment,
and coordination with other components of the medical care system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the maturing of the nationwide EMS Program, the proposed EMS Guideline No. 11 reflects a new emphasis and expanded
focus for emergency medical services. The proposed guideline recommends improvements to the entire emergency medical
services system for highway-injured patients. The elements deemed most effective in improving trauma care for the
highway-injured patient include a common phone number (e.g., 9&hyph;1&hyph;1) for quick public access, communication
between ambulances and hospitals, trained first responders and pre-hospital personnel, adequate and appropriate
transportation coverage, highly trained in-hospital personnel at specialized trauma care centers, pre-hospital
and hospital coordination, and improved data on trauma patients. The proposed guideline also recommends improved
public information, education and injury prevention efforts.

Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 14_Pedestrian Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Pedestrian Guideline No. 14 does not address Bicycle Safety Programs. The guideline was developed when
Pedestrian Safety was not a National Priority Program Area and before many countermeasures were proven to be effective.
The current guideline is narrowly focused on single issue countermeasure activities which involved primarily the
inventory of the pedestrian problem; education, particularly aimed at young school children; and engineering.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a NHTSA/FHWA joint NPRM published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on May 3, 1991, the agencies stated that effective countermeasures have been developed to address both Pedestrian
and Bicycle safety problems and specifically, concerns caused by an increase in the elderly population and the growth
in popularity of walking, jogging and bicycling. On October 4, 1991, a Final Rule was issued making Pedestrian and
Bicycle Safety a National Priority program area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed Guideline No. 14 addresses both pedestrian and bicycle safety and describes countermeasures that are
comprehensive in nature, involve a multi-disciplinary approach. These require the combined and coordinated support
of law enforcement, education, public health, driver education and licensing, transportation engineering, and
public communications. In addition, the guideline provides for legislative and regulatory solutions, outlines
methods to enlist the support of individuals and organizations outside the traditional highway safety community,
features innovative school-based practices, and highlights traffic engineering components that promote pedestrian
and bicycle safety while reducing traffic congestion.

Proposed Revisions to Guideline No. 15_Police Traffic Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The current Police Traffic Service Guideline No. 15 emphasizes the use of police patrols to enforce traffic laws,
improve traffic flow, prevent crashes, aid the injured, document each crash, supervise cleanup, and restore traffic
flow. The guideline provides minimum standards by which a police department can measure its quality in traffic services,
and suggests uniform training procedures, as well as standardized records and reporting systems. The guideline
also addresses selective assignment of personnel and coordination with other agencies and neighboring jurisdictions
and recommends in-service training for police personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proliferation of highway safety legislation in recent years, such as tougher DWI laws, child restraint and seat
belt use laws, and commercial motor vehicle safety laws, combined with an increased demand for other law enforcement
services, has placed a strain on police agencies during a time of reduced budgets, manpower and resources. The proposed
Guideline No. 15 assists law enforcement agencies by addressing how to do more with less. Such efforts include developing
and participating in comprehensive programs; enlisting support of the media, community leaders, business and volunteer/activist
groups; developing resource management plans; and training officers in state-of-the-art enforcement curricula.

The agencies have considered the impacts that would be associated with this proposed action, and determined that
it is not significant within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or the Department of Transportation Regulatory
Policies and Procedures. The guidelines contained in part 1204 are advisory, not mandatory. Accordingly, a full

Impaired Driving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have a comprehensive program to combat impaired
driving. This guideline describes the areas that each State's program should address. Throughout this guideline,
``impaired driving'' means operating any motor vehicle while one's faculties are affected by alcohol or other drugs,
medications, or other substances. ``Impaired driving'' includes, but is not limited to, impairment as defined in
State statutes.

I. Prevention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State should have prevention programs to reduce impaired driving through approaches commonly associated with
public health_altering social norms, changing risky or dangerous behaviors, and creating protective environments.
Prevention and public health programs promote activities to educate the public on the effects of alcohol and other
drugs, limit alcohol and drug availability, and prevent those impaired by alcohol and drugs from driving. Prevention
programs are typically carried out in schools, work sites, medical and health care facilities, and community groups.
Each State should implement a system of impaired driving prevention activities and to work with the public health
community to foster health and reduce traffic-related injuries.

other States, or by creating new campaigns and materials; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Encourage and support communities to implement awareness programs at the local level; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

without driving. Alternative transportation programs include:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

II. Deterrence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should have a deterrence program to reduce impaired driving through activities to create the maximum possible
perception of detection, arrest and punishment among persons who might be tempted to drive under the influence of
alcohol or other drugs, including CMV drivers. Close coordination with law enforcement agencies on the municipal,
county, and State levels is needed to create and sustain the perceived risk of being detected and arrested. Specialized
traffic enforcement efforts, such as MCSAP, also serve as a core element in the detection of impaired drivers. Equally
close coordination with courts and the motor vehicle licensing and registration agency is needed to enhance the fear
of punishment. Effective use of all available media is essential to create and maintain a strong public awareness
of impaired driving enforcement and sanctions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State should implement a system of activities to deter impaired driving. The deterrence system should include
legislation, public information and education, enforcement, prosecution, adjudication, criminal sanctions,
driver licensing, and vehicle registration activities. The goal should be to increase the perception and probability
of arrest for violators and the imposition of swift and sure sanctions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Prosecution
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should implement a comprehensive program for visible and aggressive prosecution of impaired driving cases.
These programs should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Give DWI cases high priority for prosecution;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Licensing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Driver licensing actions can be an effective means for preventing, deterring, and monitoring impaired driving.
In addition to the license sanctions for impaired driving offenses discussed earlier, States should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue provisional licenses to novice drivers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provide for license suspension for driver under age 21 who drives with a BAC exceeding .02 (or some other low value);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue distinctive licenses to drivers under the age of 21;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitor licensing records to identify high risk drivers for referral to education or remediation programs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ensure the accurate and timely reporting of alcohol and drug violations as proscribed by the Commercial Drivers License
(CDL) regulations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assure that all licensing records are used to help assess whether a driver requires alcohol or drug treatment; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Actively participate in the Driver License Compact to facilitate the exchange of driver license information between
jurisdictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Treatment and Rehabilitation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many first-time impaired driving offenders and most repeat offenders have substantial substance abuse problems
that affect their entire lives, not just their driving. They have been neither prevented nor deterred from impaired
driving. Each State should implement a system to identify and refer these drivers to appropriate substance abuse
treatment programs to change their dangerous behavior.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Diagnosis and Screening
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should have a systematic program to evaluate persons who have been convicted of an impaired driving offense
to determine if they have an alcohol or drug abuse problem. This evaluation should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Be required by law;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Be conducted by qualified personnel prior to sentencing; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Be used to decide whether a substance abuse treatment program should be part of the sanctions imposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Treatment and Rehabilitation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should establish and maintain programs to treat alcohol and other drug dependent persons referred through
traffic courts and other sources. These programs should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Ensure that those referred for impaired driving offenses are not permitted to drive again until their substance abuse
problems are under control;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Be conducted in addition to, not as a substitute for, license restrictions and other sanctions; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Be conducted separately for youth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Program Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Good program management produces effective programs. Planning and coordination are especially important for impaired
driving activities, since many different parties are involved. Each State's impaired driving program management
system should have an established process for managing its planning (including problem identification), program
control, and evaluation activities. The system should provide for community traffic safety programs (CTSPs), State
and local task forces, data analysis, and funding. It also should include planning and coordination of activities
with other agencies involved in impaired driving programs, such as MCSAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. State Program Planning
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should develop and implement an overall plan for all impaired driving activities. The plan should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Be based on careful problem definition that makes use of crash and driver record data; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Direct State and community resources toward effective measures that address the State's impaired driving issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Program Control
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should establish procedures to ensure that program activities are implemented as intended. The procedures
should provide for systematic monitoring and review of ongoing programs to:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should encourage the development of State and community impaired driving task forces and community traffic
safety programs. States should:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Use these groups to bring a wide variety of interests and resources to bear on impaired driving issues; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ensure that Federal, State, and local organizations coordinate impaired driving activities, so that the activities
complement rather than compete with each other.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Data and Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should establish and maintain records systems for accidents, arrests, dispositions, driver licenses, and
vehicle registrations. Especially important are tracking systems which can provide information on every driver
arrested for DWI to determine the disposition of the case and compliance with sanctions. These records systems should
be:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Timely;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Able to be linked to each other; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Readily accessible to police, courts, and planners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should evaluate all impaired driving system activities regularly to ensure that programs are effective and
scarce resources are allocated appropriately. Evaluation should be:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Included in initial program planning to ensure that appropriate data are available and that adequate resources are
allocated;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designed to use available traffic records systems effectively; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Evaluation results should be:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should allocate funding to impaired driving programs that is:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Traffic Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should establish and implement a complete traffic records
program. The Statewide program should include, or provide for, data for the entire State. A complete traffic records
program is necessary for planning (problem identification), operational management or control, and evaluation
of a State's highway safety activities. This type of program is basic to identifying highway safety problems, tracking
safety trends, and implementing highway safety countermeasures. It is the key ingredient to safety effectiveness
and management.

drivers, cyclists, occupants, and pedestrians involved; and documentation of crash consequences (fatalities,
injuries, property damage and violations charged) with the data tied to a location reference system;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Driver File or driver history record of licensed drivers in the State, with data on personal identification and driver
license number, type of license, license status (suspended or revoked), driver restrictions, driver convictions
for traffic violations, crash history, driver control or improvement actions, and safety education data;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Vehicle File with information on identification, ownership and taxation, and vehicle inspection (where applicable);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Roadway File with information about roadway location, identification, and classification as well as a description
of a road's total physical characteristics, which is tied to a location reference system. This file should also contain
data for normalizing purposes, such as miles of roadway and average daily traffic (ADT);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Commercial Motor Vehicle Crash File which uses uniform data definitions and collects information on the vehicle
configuration, cargo body type, hazardous materials, information to identify the motor carrier, as well as information

II. Data Characteristics
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Traffic records programs should meet basic requirements for the most effective use of the data by program managers.
Accordingly, each State should emphasize the following characteristics:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
An accurate identification of the crash location;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Timely and accurate data collection and input to all files, and especially to the Accident and Driver Files, to assure
maximum utilization and confidence in the traffic records system. Each state is encouraged to join and fully participate

Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have a comprehensive pedestrian and bicycle
safety program that educates and motivates its citizens to follow safe pedestrian and bicycle practices. A combination
of legislation, regulations, policy, enforcement, public information, education, incentives, and engineering
is necessary to achieve significant, lasting improvements in pedestrian and bicycle crash rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each State should recognize that its pedestrians and bicyclists_citizens of all ages who are virtually unprotected
from the forces of a crash, face major safety problems and are a valid traffic safety concern. Because of the diverse
nature of these issues, education, enforcement, and engineering are critical components to any strategies devised
to reduce these problems. In formulating policy, the State should promote these specific issues: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The provision of early pedestrian and bicycle safety education and training for preschool children; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of pedestrian and bicyclist safety in health and safety education curricula; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inclusion of pedestrian and bicyclist safety in driver training programs and driver licensing activities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision of a safe environment for pedestrians and bicyclists through such measures as sidewalks and bicycle
facilities, in the planning and design of all highway projects; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of bicycle helmets as a primary measure to reduce death and injury among bicyclists; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An awareness of the role of alcohol in adult pedestrian accidents; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safeguarding of older citizens from pedestrian accidents; and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The establishment and support of Community/Corridor Traffic Safety Programs at the local level. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A comprehensive highway safety system is the most effective means of producing consistent, long-term changes in
knowledge and behavior necessary to improve pedestrian and bicycle safety. The following components create a structure
for identifying problem areas; implementing, measuring, and evaluating the problem areas; and directing the results
back into system improvements. We believe these elements will effectively address the problem.

I. Program Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should have centralized program planning, initiation, and coordination to promote pedestrian and bicycle
safety program issues as part of a comprehensive highway safety program. Evaluation is also important for determining
progress and ultimate success of pedestrian and bicycle safety programs and for providing those results to revise
existing programs and to develop new programs. The State should have program staff trained in pedestrian and bicyclist
safety so that this program can:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Conduct regular problem identification activities to identify fatality and injury crash trends for pedestrians
and bicyclists and to provide guidance in development of countermeasures,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provide leadership, training, and technical assistance to other State agencies and local pedestrian and bicycle
safety programs and projects;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Law Enforcement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should ensure that State and community pedestrian and bicycle programs include a law enforcement component.
Each State should strongly emphasize the role played by law enforcement personnel in pedestrian and bicyclist safety.
Essential components of that role include:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

V. Traffic Engineering
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Traffic engineering is a critical element of any crash reduction program. This is true not only for the development
of programs to reduce an existing crash problem, but also to design transportation facilities that provide for the
safe movement of pedestrians, bicyclists, and all motor vehicles. Balancing the needs of pedestrians and those of
vehicular traffic (including bicycle) must always be considered. Therefore, each State should ensure that State
and community pedestrian and bicycle programs include a traffic engineering component. Traffic engineering efforts
should be coordinated with enforcement and educational efforts. This effort should improve the protection of pedestrians
and bicyclists by application of appropriate traffic engineering measures in design, construction, operation,
and maintenance. These measures should include but not be limited to the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Outreach Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should encourage extensive community involvement in pedestrian and bicycle safety education by involving
individuals and organizations outside the traditional highway safety community. Community involvement broadens
public support for the State's programs and can increase a State's ability to deliver highway safety education programs.
To encourage community involvement, States should:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

VIII. School-Based Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should incorporate pedestrian and bicycle safety education into school curricula. Safe walking and bicycle-riding
practices to and from school and school-related events are good health habits and, like other health habits, must
be taught at an early age and reinforced until the habit is well established. The State Department of Education and
the State Highway Safety Agency should:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Ensure that highway safety in general, and pedestrian and bicycle safety in particular, are included in the State-approved
K&hyph;12 health and safety education curricula and textbooks;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establish and enforce written policies requiring safe walking and bicycling practices to and from school, including
use of bicycle helmets on school property; and

IX. Driver Education and Licensing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should address pedestrian and bicycle issues in State driver education and licensing programs. Pedestrian
and bicycle safety principles and rules should be included in all driver training and licensing examinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
X. Evaluation Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Both evaluation and problem identification require good record keeping by the State and its political subdivisions.
The State should identify the types and frequency of pedestrian and bicyclist crash problems in terms that are relevant
to both the selection and evaluation of appropriate countermeasure programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State should promote effective evaluation of programs by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Police Traffic Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have an efficient and effective police traffic
services (PTS) program to enforce traffic laws, prevent crashes, assist the injured, document specific details
of individual crashes, supervise crash clean-up, and restore safe and orderly movement of traffic. PTS is critical
to the success of most traffic safety countermeasures. Traffic law enforcement plays an important role in deterring
drunk and drugged driving, achieving safety belt use, encouraging compliance with speed laws, and reducing other
unsafe driving actions. Experience has shown that a combination of highly visible enforcement, public information,
education, and training is necessary to achieve a significant and lasting impact in reducing crashes, injuries,
and fatalities. At a minimum, a well-balanced statewide PTS program should be made up of the components detailed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Program Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Planning and Coordination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Centralized program planning, implementation, and coordination are essential for achieving and sustaining effective
PTS programs. The State Highway Safety Agency (SHSA), in conjunction with State and local law enforcement agencies,
should ensure that these planning and coordinating functions are performed with regard to the State's traffic safety
program, since law enforcement is in most instances a principle component of that program. In carrying out its responsibility
of centralized program planning and coordination, the State should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Provide leadership, training, and technical assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coordinate PTS and other traffic safety program areas including Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) safety activities
such as the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Develop and implement a comprehensive plan for all PTS activities, in cooperation with law enforcement leaders;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Program Elements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State and local law enforcement agencies, in conjunction with the SHSA, should establish PTS as a priority within
their total enforcement program. A PTS program should be built on a foundation of commitment, coordination, planning,
monitoring, and evaluation within the agency's enforcement program. State and local law enforcement agencies should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Provide the public with a high quality, effective PTS system and have enabling legislation and regulations in place
to implement PTS functions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Develop and implement a comprehensive enforcement plan for alcohol and drug impaired driving, safety belt use and
child passenger safety laws, speeding, and other hazardous moving violations. The plan should initiate action to
look beyond the issuance of traffic tickets to include enforcement of laws by drivers of all types of vehicles, including
trucks, automobiles, and motorcycles;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Develop a cooperative working relationship with other local, county, and State governmental agencies and community
organizations on traffic safety issues;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issue and enforce policies on roadside sobriety checkpoints, safety belt use, pursuit driving, crash investigating
and reporting, speed enforcement, and serious traffic violations; and

II. Resource Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States should encourage law enforcement agencies to develop and maintain a comprehensive resource management plan
to identify and deploy resources needed to effectively support enforcement programs. The resource management plan
should include a specific component on traffic enforcement and safety, integrating traffic enforcement and safety
initiatives into a total agency enforcement program. Law enforcement agencies should:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Traffic Law Enforcement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The enforcement of traffic laws and ordinances is a basic responsibility shared by all police agencies. The primary
objective of this function is to encourage motorists and pedestrians to comply voluntarily with the laws. Administrators
should apply their enforcement resources in ways that ensure the greatest safety impact. Traffic law enforcement
programs should be based on:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Countermeasures designed to address specific problems;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enforcement actions applied at appropriate times and places, coupled with a public information effort designed
to make the motoring public aware of the problem and the planned enforcement action; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A system to document and publicize results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Public Information and Education
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Necessity of Public Information and Education
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public awareness and knowledge about traffic enforcement are essential for sustaining increased compliance with
all traffic laws. This requires a well-organized, effectively-managed public information and education program.
The SHSA, in cooperation with law enforcement agencies, should develop a statewide public information and education
campaign that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Identifies and targets specific audiences;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addresses enforcement of safety belt use and child passenger safety, drunk and drugged driving, speed, and other
serious traffic laws;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Capitalizes on special events, such as Operation C.A.R.E., Child Passenger Safety Awareness, Buckle Up, America!
and Drunk and Drugged Driving Awareness weeks;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Identifies and supports the efforts of traffic safety activist groups to gain increased support of and attention
to traffic safety and enforcement;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The task of public information can be divided into two interconnected areas: external and internal information.
Both areas, properly administered, will benefit the agency and work in concert to accomplish the goal of establishing
and maintaining a positive police-public relationship.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

V. Data Collection and Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The availability of valid data is critical to any approach intended to increase the level of highway safety. An effective
records program provides fast and accurate information to field personnel who are performing primary traffic functions
and to management for decision-making. Data are usually collected from crash reports, daily officer activity reports
that contain workload and citation information, highway department records (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SHSA, in conjunction with State and local law enforcement agencies, should develop a comprehensive evaluation
program to measure progress toward established project goals and objectives; effectively plan and implement statewide
and local PTS programs; optimize the allocation of limited resources; measure the impact of traffic enforcement
on reducing crime and traffic crashes, injuries, and deaths; and compare costs of criminal activity to costs of traffic
crashes. Law enforcement managers should:

Speed Control
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have, as part of a comprehensive highway safety
program, an effective speed control program that encourages its citizens to voluntarily comply with speed limits.
The program should stress systematic and rational establishment of speed limits, a law enforcement commitment to
controlling speed on all public roads, a commitment to utilize both traditional methods and state-of-the art equipment
in setting and enforcing speed limits, and a strong public information and education program aimed at increasing
driver compliance with speed limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Program Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State and local law enforcement agencies, transportation departments, and the State Highway Safety Agency (SHSA)
should establish speed control as a priority within their total highway safety program. The speed control program
should contain the following elements: program management, procedures for establishing reasonable speed limits,
coordinated enforcement efforts, public information and education, identification and utilization of new technology,
legislative coordination and commitment, training, and evaluation. When planning and developing a program to address
speed control, the issue of speed should be examined in light of the empirical data available, current methods for
setting speed limits, and the current public perception of speed compliance. Added to these elements is the law enforcement
response, including the resources available to enforcement agencies. Only after these components have been examined
and defined can the goals of a speed control program be formulated. In carrying out its responsibility of centralized
program planning and coordination, the State should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Develop and implement a comprehensive speed control plan in cooperation with law enforcement leaders, traffic engineers,
educators, and leaders of the community;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Provide leadership, training, and technical assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies and highway/traffic
agencies;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generate broad based support for speed control programs through education on the scope and severity of the problem;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Integrate speed control into the overall traffic enforcement and engineering program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Enforcement Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should strongly emphasize speed enforcement as part of its overall traffic enforcement program. The speed
enforcement program should include enforcement strategies and other components of a comprehensive approach to
address the speed issue. The plan should address the following concepts:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Including public information and education components along with vigorous enforcement in State and local anti-speeding
programs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collecting data to help in problem identification and evaluation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Identifying high risk crash locations where speed is a contributing factor in crashes;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Integrating speed control programs into related highway safety activities such as drunk driving prevention, safety
belt and safety programs for young people;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Targeting anti-speeding programs to address specific audiences and situations: young drivers, males, nighttime,
adverse weather and traffic conditions, drunk driving, CMV drivers, school zones, construction and maintenance
work zones, roads and streets with major potential conflicts in traffic and with pedestrians, and so on;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using speed measuring devices that are both efficient and cost effective, including new speed measurement technology
such as laser speed measuring devices, electronic signing and photo-radar; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Training officers in the proper use of equipment and educating other members of the criminal justice system, such
as judges and prosecutors, on the principles of devices using new technology.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

III. Setting of Speed Limits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States and local governments should undertake comprehensive efforts to identify rational criteria for establishing
speed limits and should include strategies to address the speed issue. These efforts should include:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of criteria used to establish speed limits including the recognition of unique operational characteristics
of CMV's;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of state-of-the art technology to collect data to establish speed limits;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of variable message speed limit signs to reinforce the appropriate speed limit for prevailing conditions;

IV. Public Information and Education
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Focused public information and education campaigns are an essential part of a comprehensive speed control program.
Research shows that compliance with and support for traffic laws can be increased through aggressive, targeted enforcement
combined with an effective public information and education campaign. The SHSA, in cooperation with law enforcement
and transportation agencies, should develop a Statewide public information and education campaign that:

V. Technology
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New and updated technology for speed measurement is needed to determine appropriated speed limits for a variety of
conditions and to provide maximum enforcement activity with fewer available resources. Current technology for
measuring speed, such as loop detectors, should be used not only to establish viable speed limits but also to vary speed
limits to conform to existing conditions. State and local governments should only utilize speed measurement equipment
for enforcement that is approved or recognized as reliable and accurate. All law enforcement agencies should use
the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) regional testing laboratories to ensure that equipment
used to measure speeds meets minimum standards. For CMV enforcement purposes, the FHWA will provide MCSAP funding
only for those items of speed control equipment approved by the ICAP or which meet other suitable standards. The SHSA,
in conjunction with law enforcement and traffic/highway agencies, should support programs providing for:

with variable message signs;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Police Radar Model Minimum Specifications_NHTSA, in cooperation with the IACP and the National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST), has developed model specifications and testing protocols for police traffic radar. Using
these model specification, IACP in cooperation with radar manufacturers and NHTSA, has established a program to
test radar sets that are available for purchase by law enforcement agencies. Reports of the testing were published
by IACP along with a Consumer Products List which provides law enforcement agencies with the names of radar sets conforming
with the model performance specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Police Radar Testing Program_To ensure that law enforcement agencies can continue to purchase and operate accurate
radar devices, IACP, in cooperation with radar manufacturers and NHTSA, has established an ongoing process of performance
testing for newly developed devices and for maintaining existing equipment. Testing laboratories have been established
at five universities. These laboratories will continue the testing program and will provide services to the law enforcement
community.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should vigorously promote the use of child safety seats. States should require every child up to 40 pounds
to ride correctly secured in a child safety seat that meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (see Program Component
II: Legislation, Regulation, and Policy). State and community child passenger safety programs that will help to
achieve that objective should be established to: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Educate parents, pediatricians, hospitals, law enforcement, EMS and the general public about the safety risks to
small children, the benefits of child safety seats, and their responsibilities for compliance with child passenger
safety laws;

VII. School-Based Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should incorporate occupant protection education in school curricula. Buckling up is a good health habit
and, like other health habits, must be taught at an early age and reinforced until the habit is well established. The
State Department of Education and the State Highway Safety Agency should: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Worksite Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State should encourage all employers to require safety belt use on the job as a condition of employment. The Federal
government has already taken that step for its employees. Private sector employers should follow the lead of Federal
and State government employers and comply with all applicable FHWA Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations or Occupational
Health and Safety (OSHA) regulations requiring private business employees to use safety belts on the job. All employers
should:

Roadway Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each State, in cooperation with its political subdivisions, should have a comprehensive roadway safety program
that is directed toward reducing the number and severity of traffic crashes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Program Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) provides administrative oversight for the Roadway Safety portion of
the section 402 highway safety program in close coordination with the State Highway Safety Agency (SHSA) and the State
Highway Agency (SHA). Although section 402 dollars cannot be utilized for highway construction, maintenance or
design activities, they can be used to develop and implement systems and procedures for carrying out safety construction
and operational improvements. These funds can also be used to augment Federal-aid highway programs, such as the Hazard
Elimination Program (Section 152) and the Rail-Highway Crossings Programs (Section 130), as well as other safety
construction activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An effective Roadway Safety program is based on sound analyses of roadway-related crash information and applies
engineering principles in identifying highway design or operational improvements that will address the crash problem.
The SHSA should:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Assign program staff to work directly with the FHWA division safety engineer on roadway-related safety programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Work in close harmony with the SHA, particularly with SHA staff who are responsible for traffic engineering, pedestrian
and bicycle programs, CMV safety, rail-highway crossing safety issues, work zone safety, design and operational
improvements, and hazardous roadway locations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Foster an ongoing dialogue among all disciplines with a vested interest in highway safety, including engineers,
enforcement personnel, traffic safety specialists, driver licensing administrators, CMV safety specialists,
and data specialists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Promote a multi-disciplinary approach to addressing highway safety issues which focuses on comprehensive solutions
to identified problems. An example is assisting in the coordination and the implementation of Community/Corridor
Traffic Safety Programs, and MCSAP, where appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Become familiar with the various highway-safety related categories of Federal-aid highway funds_in addition to
section 402_in order to maximize the safety benefits of the entire program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Become familiar with the State's traffic records system and play a role in the system's ongoing operation, maintenance
and enhancement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assist community leaders in managing and/or coordinating programs designed to address roadway safety issues and
concerns which fall under the jurisdiction of local communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Become familiar with MCSAP and coordinate MCSAP and section 402 program activities.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) was signed into law December 18, 1991. Section
2002(a) of ISTEA, Highway Safety Programs, requires that the Secretary of Transportation either designate six key
areas as priority highway safety programs or submit a report to congress describing the reasons for not prioritizing
these programs. The six program areas involve: Speed control, Use of occupant protection devices, Driving while
impaired, Motorcycle safety, School Bus Safety, and Police Traffic Services. The existing National Priority Program
Areas address four of the six areas identified by the Act, but do not include Speed Control or School Bus Safety. The
agencies have reviewed existing data and statistics regarding deaths and injuries attributable to these two areas
and have considered the availability of existing countermeasures related to speed control and school bus safety,
and tentatively propose to include Speed Control as a Priority Program Area, but have tentatively concluded that
School Bus Safety does not warrant being included as a Priority Program. Interested persons are invited to submit
comments on this proposal.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State and Community Highway Safety Grant Program (the 402 program) was established under the Highway Safety Act
of 1966, 23 U.S.C. 402. The Act required the establishment of Uniform Standards for State Highway Safety Programs
to assist the States and local communities in organizing their highway safety programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighteen such standards were established and have been administered at the Federal level by FHWA and NHTSA. NHTSA
is responsible for developing and implementing highway safety programs relating to the vehicle and driver, while
FHWA has similar responsibilities in program areas involving the roadway.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until 1976, the 402 program was principally directed towards achieving State and local compliance with the 18 Highway
Safety Program Standards, which were considered mandatory requirements with financial sanctions for noncompliance.
Under the Highway Safety Act of 1976, Congress provided for a more flexible implementation of the program so that the
Secretary would not have to require State compliance with every uniform standard or with each element of every uniform
standard. As a result, the standards became more like guidelines for use by the States. Management of the program then
shifted from enforcing standards to one of problem identification, and countermeasure development and evaluation,
using the standards as a framework for the State programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1981, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Public Law 97&hyph;35, revising the section
402 program. The Act directed the agencies to conduct rulemaking to determine those State and local highway safety
programs most effective in reducing accidents, injuries, and fatalities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 1, 1982, NHTSA and FHWA issued a joint final rule (47 FR 15116) identifying six National Priority Program Areas
which the agencies then considered to be the most effective highway safety programs. The six program areas included
one FHWA program area, Safety Construction and Operational Improvements, and the following NHTSA Program Areas:
Occupant Protection, Alcohol Countermeasures, Police Traffic Services, Emergency Medical Services, and Traffic
Records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The April 1982 final rule provided that these National Priority Program Areas would be eligible for Federal funding
under an expedited procedure under the 402 program (23 CFR 1205.4.). It also established a mechanism by which other,
non-priority programs identified by a State may be eligible for Federal funding. (23 CFR 1205.5 (a) and (b).)

Periodic Review and Determination of Priority Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 2, 1987, the enactment of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (Pub.
L. 100&hyph;17) revised 23 U.S.C. 402. The changes provided for a periodic review of the effectiveness of the various
programs eligible for funding under section 402 in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. The periodic review
procedure was believed to be the best method of ensuring the continued relevance of the section 402 program to changing
circumstances and traffic safety needs, and for ensuring that Federal funds continue to be used for the most effective
programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislation also provided that the terms ``standard'' and ``standards'' within 23 CFR Part 1204 be replaced with
the words ``guideline'' and ``guidelines.'' The purpose of this amendment was to conform the language of section
402 to the current implementation of the programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to these amendments, NHTSA and FHWA conducted a rulemaking action to review those programs most effective
in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. In a final rule issued on April 6, 1988, (53 FR 1255) the agencies determined
that the National Priority Program Areas should continue to include the one FHWA program area, Roadway Safety (formerly,
Safety Construction and Operational Improvements), and the five NHTSA program areas that had been identified in
1982. In addition, the agencies determined that a sixth NHTSA area, Motorcycle Safety, should also be included.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 3, 1991, NHTSA/FHWA published a joint NPRM (56 FR 20387) proposing to add Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety as one
of the National Priority program areas. The public comments supported that proposal and resulted in the addition
of that area as one of the National Priority Program Areas eligible for the expedited funding process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of these prior rulemaking actions, the National Priority Program Areas currently include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Alcohol and Other Drug Countermeasures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Roadway Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies apply three criteria to determine whether a program area should be identified as a National Priority
Program under 23 CFR Part 1205:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether the problem is of national concern; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether effective countermeasures have been developed in this area which address this concern; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether State programs in the area appear to be among the most effective in reducing crashes, injuries, and
fatalities as compared to other traffic safety program areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether a problem is of national concern, the agencies consider the relative magnitude of the problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's notice is being issued to solicit comments on a proposal of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to expand this list of National Priority Program Areas to include
Speed Control, and to obtain comments on the agencies' preliminary determination that School Bus Safety should not
be added as a National Priority Program Area at this time. The agencies have considered relevant data, statistics,
and other available information in reaching this conclusion and now seek public comments from interested parties
on these tentative determinations. The following discussion highlights the key issues and factors considered by
the agencies in making these preliminary determinations. (In a separate notice published elsewhere in this issue
of the

Is Speeding a Problem of National Concern?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issue of speed control has received considerable attention by NHTSA and FHWA. Over the course of the agencies'
history, we have funded and promoted many programs and initiatives addressing the problem. Speeding is defined as
not only exceeding the posted speed limit, but also driving too fast for conditions. Some common conclusions from
these programs and initiatives indicate that higher speeds and speeds too fast for conditions (whether or not travelling
in excess of the speed limit) adversely affect the safety of motorists.

Speeding is Becoming More Prevalent
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While many speed/traffic surveys are taken, reliable data on travel speed are relatively limited, and often difficult
to compare. The most reliable speed data are those reported by the States for National Maximum Speed Limit (NMSL) roadways
posted at 55 mph. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) publishes an annual report containing a compendium of
speed monitoring data submitted by each State. Analyses of recent speed monitoring data by the FHWA indicate that
speeds at which many motorists travel have increased in recent years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are less comprehensive data collected for roadways which have speed limits of less than 55 mph, including the
many rural highways and urban/suburban streets and roads which are posted at lower speeds for reasons of road design,
traffic patterns, volume, and safety. These non-NMSL roads account for 74 percent of the total paved road mileage
in the U.S. and for approximately 47 percent of all traffic deaths. The lack of empirical data makes it difficult to
identify the extent of the speeding problem on these non-NMSL roads. A recent FHWA study of these roads entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Assessment of Current Speed Zoning Criteria 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
found that: (1) On average, seven out of ten motorists exceeded posted limits; (2) average speeds ran approximately
two to six mph above posted limits; and (3) prevailing 85th percentile speeds ran approximately eight to twelve mph
above posted limits. The observations of law enforcement executives and other highway safety officials confirm
that speeds are increasing on these roads.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Speed surveys on the Interstate highways also show that average speeds and the percent of traffic travelling at high
speeds have also increased on these roads. For example, the percent of vehicles exceeding 65 mph (on roadways with
a 65 mph speed limit) were estimated to be 47 percent in 1990 (up from 37% in 1988) while those exceeding 70 mph accounted
for approximately 19 percent (up from approximately 16 percent in 1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After Congress amended the NMSL in 1987 to permit 20 States to increase the speed limit to 65 mph on rural interstates
as a demonstration program, NHTSA issued a detailed report on the effects of the increase. This interim report indicated
that average speeds increased somewhat on rural interstates. The latest NMSL research, contained in the agency's

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Report to Congress on the Effects of the 65 mph Speed Limit through 1990 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(NHTSA, May 1992), shows the average travel speed on rural 65 mph Interstates in 1990 was 65 mph (up from 63 mph in 1988);
the 85th percentile speed was 71 mph (up from 69 mph in 1988); and fatalities on rural interstates were an estimated
30 percent higher in 1990 than the number expected, based on historical trends, had the speed limit remained at 55 mph.
A series of focus group discussions held by NHTSA with the general public suggest that most drivers recognize speeding
as a violation of the law, but few regard the violation as a serious offense.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These studies all suggest that the motoring public does not view speeding per se as an immediate risk to their personal
safety.

Excessive Speed Causes Crashes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Speeding is one of the most prevalent reported factors associated with crashes. Studies identify correlations between
speeding and other factors including alcohol involvement, young drivers, male drivers, motorcyclists, and nighttime
driving. Speeding is cited as a contributing factor in approximately 11 percent of all police-reported crashes and
in approximately 34 percent of all fatal crashes (NHTSA, Fatal Accident Reporting System, 1991). It is estimated
that in 1991, 13,909 fatalities and 77,277 moderate to critical injuries occurred in speed-related crashes. The
economic cost of all speed-related crashes (including all injury levels) was over $18 billion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Excessive speed has long been recognized as one of the prime factors contributing to motor vehicle crashes. This contribution
has several sources:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Drivers have less time to react when travelling at higher speeds since speed increases the distance a vehicle
travels during the time it takes for a driver to react to a perceived danger;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Speed increases the total stopping distance necessary to halt a vehicle; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Speed reduces a driver's ability to steer safely around curves on highways, or objects in the roadway.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A major speed-related factor which has been linked to crash involvement is speed variance: The difference in speed
among vehicles in the traffic stream. Speed variance is calculated in terms of standard deviation from the mean speed.
For example, ten vehicles all traveling at 55 mph on the same highway would have a mean speed of 55 mph and a standard deviation
of zero, whereas five vehicles traveling at 65 mph and five vehicles traveling at 45 mph would have a mean speed of 55
mph but a standard deviation of 10.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research studies such as those in 55: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A Decade of Experience
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Transportation Research Board, 1984) have shown that motor vehicle crashes are more likely where speed variance
is greater. As speed variance increases, vehicles come close to each other more frequently. This leads to more frequent
lane changes and passing maneuvers as the faster drivers seek to avoid slower vehicles. Data from the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Crash Severity Study
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1979) show that vehicles travelling 20 mph above the average speed experience a crash risk 11 times greater than those
travelling at the average speed. This data implies that crashes can be reduced by controlling speed variance. Controlling
speed variance is especially critical on roadways with speed limits less than 65 mph, where conflicting actions and
reactions typically cause much larger variations in speed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Speed Increases the Severity of Crashes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The trend toward increased speeds is cause for concern because of the reduced margin for error and the increase in severity
for those vehicles involved in crashes. As the speed of a car increases from 20 mph to 80 mph, a factor of four, the energy
of the impact delivered in a collision with a fixed object goes up by a factor of sixteen. The chance of death or serious
injury increases dramatically for every 10 mph increase in vehicle speed for the crash involved vehicle. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
National Crash Severity Study
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (NHTSA, 1979) revealed that a driver crashing with a 50 mph change in velocity is twice as likely to be killed as one crashing
with a 40 mph change in velocity. In short, crashes at higher speeds increase the potential for more deaths and disabling
injuries.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Have Effective Speed Control Countermeasures Been Developed?
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Enforcement personnel have several effective countermeasures available for speed control which have been developed
by new technology. Traditional methods of speed control once involved the use of stopwatches and pneumatic hoses
stretched across the roadway to determine vehicle speeds. Later developments included the introduction of radar
and VASCAR which more precisely measured vehicle speeds and reduced the degree of possible operator error. Currently
laser speed measuring devices with an extremely high degree of accuracy are becoming available to the law enforcement
community.NHTSA has taken an active role in identifying and evaluating new law enforcement technology. After evaluating
new devices, NHTSA has established demonstration programs to introduce those devices into the law enforcement community
to further advance speed control efforts. These demonstration programs have included enforcing speed limits using
radar, VASCAR, laser speed measuring devices, aerial speed measurement, photo radar, electronic signing and saturation
patrols.NHTSA studies show that one of the best methods to obtain compliance with speed limits is to combine an aggressive
enforcement campaign with a vigorous public information and education effort. Public service announcements (PSA)
regarding speed are regularly developed and distributed by NHTSA. Furthermore, other effective countermeasures,
such as saturation patrols and multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional enforcement efforts, have been developed and
furnished to the law enforcement community. These programs can easily become a part of an agency's traffic enforcement
program.Several highway design and traffic control measures have also demonstrated effectiveness for speed control.
Freeway design, culminating in the Interstate System, eliminated all at-grade intersections thus providing for
free flow traffic. This singular design characteristic resulted in significant reduction in speed variance and
the promotion of uniform operating speed. Speed variances on the Interstate System have traditionally been in the
range of 6&hyph;9 miles per hour while speed variances on non-freeway facilities can be as great as 20 miles per hour.In
addition, the need to control speed for varying conditions has led to the development of variable message speed signs.
These devices, first used on the New Jersey Turnpike in the late 1960's have had widespread implementation on all types
of facilities and warn drivers of impeding congestion, weather conditions, construction, and incidents which required
reduction in operating speed. Real time regulatory variable speed limits are now being tested in the State of Washington.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies believe that Federal, State, and local governments should have balanced programs that use the most cost-effective
strategies for decreasing crash risks from speeding. This includes: (1) Targeting enforcement where speeding has
a significant impact on public safety and accompanying it with public information and education; (2) using a variety
of techniques and technologies for speed control; (3) understanding who speeds, where, and why; and (4) ensuring
that posted speed limits are appropriate for conditions. These efforts can be further enhanced through the development
of comprehensive speed control programs which include establishment of appropriate criteria for the setting and
posting of speed limits, focused attention upon roadway construction and condition, posting of appropriate roadway
signs, elimination of hazards adjacent to the roadway, and establishment of research projects to further study the
characteristics and consequences of speeding in order to develop improved countermeasures and guidelines.

 to identify methods to address the speeding problem. The plan relies heavily upon programs and projects that have
proven to be most effective and outlines speed control initiatives that have proven successful. The plan also stresses
a law enforcement commitment to controlling speed on all public roads, using state-of-the-art equipment, with a
strong emphasis on public information and education designed to increase driver compliance with speed limits.

The State programs that have been conducted to date demonstrate that speed control countermeasures are extremely
effective in reducing deaths and injuries. For example, the New York State Police 55 mph enforcement project was successful
in decreasing the number of drivers traveling at the highest rates of speed (often considered to be ``professional
speeders''). While average speed declined slightly from 61.6 to 61.3 mph, the percent of drivers exceeding 70 mph
declined from 6.9% to 5.1%. The percent exceeding 65 mph declined from 24.1% to 21.4%, and the percent exceeding 60
mph declined from 56.4% to 55.7%. This success is believed to have ultimately led to reductions in the number of fatal
crashes, fatalities and serious injuries suffered in New York.

In South Carolina, it is believed that the state's rural initiative involving sheriffs contributed to a significant
reduction in crashes, injuries, and fatalities in 1991 as compared to 1989. During that period, the state experienced
12,472 fewer crashes, 2,331 fewer injuries and 106 fewer fatalities. South Carolina's PSA campaign also received
widespread recognition from across the State and is believed to have contributed to the reduction of crashes during
the time the campaign was operational.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the first year of the St. Louis enforcement operation, ending September 1991, the average speed dropped from
62 mph to 61 mph on the 55 mph roadways in the metro area, as a result of the police agencies issuing 3,698 citations and
5,600 warnings for speeding during the Operation Gateway period. This cooperative program is continuing and is expected
to result in further speed decreases on the involved roadways in the metro St. Louis area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the speed control efforts targeting commercial vehicles appear to be effective, with early results from
the 1987 Commercial Motor Vehicle Enforcement project in California indicating that all crashes where commercial
vehicles were at fault decreased by 3.5% (from 810 in 1986 to 782 in 1987) in the five test sites throughout the State.
Further, the number of accidents caused by commercial vehicles which resulted in injuries in these test sites also
declined by 11.2% (from 259 in 1986 to 230 in 1987). Accompanying that reduction was a corresponding decrease in the
societal cost of injuries and fatalities resulting from such crashes.

Determination Regarding Speed Control

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies believe it is clear that excessive speed does represent a significant traffic safety problem. Speeding
is a problem throughout the country in all regions and on all types of roads. Numerous countermeasures have been developed
that have proven to be most effective in addressing this problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies, therefore, tentatively conclude that Speed Control meets all requisite criteria and propose to include
it as a National Priority Program Area.

The safety of children in school buses has been a primary concern of parents and school systems ever since buses began
to be used to transport children. That concern has helped develop school buses into the safest form of transportation
in the country. According to the National Safety Council's ``Accident Facts'' (1991), during the 1989&hyph;90 school
year, it is estimated that 380,000 buses were used to transport 22 million pupils approximately 3.8 billion miles
(21 million miles per school day). The National Safety Council statistics also indicate fatality rates per hundred
million passenger miles in 1989 were 1.12 for passenger cars and 0.04 for school buses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The relative safety of school buses is evident from the following table, which shows all vehicle occupant fatalities.
Included are the number of preschool (0&hyph;4) and school-age children (5&hyph;18) who were fatally injured in
motor vehicle crashes in 1990, and the type of vehicle in which they were riding at the time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
School bus-related crashes result in fatalities not only to occupants of school buses and other vehicles, but also
to pedestrians. Pedestrians accounted for 28 percent of the total school bus-related fatalities from 1986 through
1990. In crashes involving school buses during that period, an average of 38 pedestrians were fatally injured each
year, with 72 percent being struck by the bus, while the remaining 28 percent were struck by another vehicle. Approximately
75 percent of pedestrian fatalities involving school buses from 1986&hyph;1990 were of school age (less than 20 years
of age); of these, approximately 69 percent were struck by the bus.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Safety Council reports that during the 1989&hyph;1990 school year, most of these pedestrian fatalities
involved individuals who were either approaching or leaving a loading zone and that more than half of the pupil pedestrian
victims were struck by the school bus which they were boarding or exiting. The National Academy of Science's Special
Report No. 222, ``School Bus Safety,'' (1989) states that injuries received at bus stops tend to be more severe than
injuries received on board a bus. The report also states that, as pedestrians, children between the ages of five and
six are particularly vulnerable and account for more than one-half of the young pedestrians fatally injured by school
buses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
School bus crashes have a much different effect on the population as a whole than automobile crashes. When a child is
fatally injured in a school bus crash there is a greater sense of loss and a greater sense of tragedy. For this reason,
school bus fatalities and crashes often receive a high degree of public attention and draw an immediate and passionate
response from the community. However, the number of fatalities in school bus crashes is small, particularly when
considering exposure and when compared to the number of fatalities related to other priority programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, passenger cars were involved in 82.8 percent of all traffic crashes and 67.9 percent of all fatal crashes;
whereas school buses were involved in only 0.4 percent of all traffic crashes and in 0.3 percent of all fatal crashes.
These data demonstrate that the safety problem related to school buses is not great when compared to that of other types
of vehicles.

Have Effective School Bus Safety Measures Been Developed?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although statistics demonstrate that school buses already provide a remarkably safe form of transportation, the
agency has taken steps to further improve school bus safety. At the request of Congress, the National Academy of Sciences
(NAS) studied school bus safety to determine which safety measures would be ``most effective'' in protecting school
children while boarding, exiting and riding in school buses. (See, ``Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation
Assistance Act of 1987,'' Pub. L. 100&hyph;17, 204(a), 101 Stat. 219, April 2, 1987.) In May 1989, the National Research
Council (NRC), an agency of the NAS, issued a report entitled ``Improving School Bus Safety,'' Special Report No.
222. The report confirmed the high level of safety provided by the Nation's school bus fleet, and also suggested measures
that could further improve the safety of school buses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the 1987 law, NHTSA reviewed the findings of the NAS report and, on July 13, 1989, published a notice
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 29629), in which the agency determined which safety measures would be most effective in protecting the safety
of school children while boarding, exiting and riding in school buses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA found replacing pre-1977 school buses to be a ``most effective'' measure, because of the higher level of crashworthiness
provided by NHTSA's 1977 school bus standards, the improved mirror systems, and other crash avoidance measures typically
provided on newer school buses. The agency also found prohibiting standees on school buses to be a ``most effective''
measure. In addition, NHTSA found a number of measures which address the safety of children while boarding or exiting
the bus to be ``most effective.'' They include equipping new buses with stop signal arms and cross-view mirrors and
implementing student crossing, pedestrian safety education and school bus driver training programs. NHTSA also
identified a number of measures as ``effective.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency took several steps to encourage the adoption of these ``effective'' and ``most effective'' measures.
In FY's 1990 and 1991, NHTSA set aside, in accordance with provisions in the Highway Safety Act of 1987 (Title II, Pub.
L. 100&hyph;17), funds to assist the States in implementing these school bus safety measures. The funds were used
by States on measures that had been designated by NHTSA to be either ``effective'' or ``most effective'' in improving
school bus safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NHTSA conducted a number of rulemaking actions to upgrade the agency's school bus safety standards.
For example, NHTSA issued a final rule on May 3, 1991, requiring new school buses manufactured after September 1, 1992,
to be equipped with a stop signal arm (56 FR 20363); a final rule on November 2, 1992, revising the minimum requirements
for school bus emergency exits and improving access to school bus emergency doors (57 FR 49413); and a final rule on
December 2, 1992, requiring that school buses enable drivers to see, either directly or through mirrors, certain
specified areas in front of and along both sides of the buses (57 FR 57000).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, as stated previously, in a final rule dated October 4, 1991, NHTSA and FHWA expanded the list of National Priority
programs areas, which are eligible for section 402 funding using an expedited process, to include Pedestrian and
Bicycle Safety. The agencies considered the problem of school bus-related pedestrian fatalities when they decided
to add Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety to the list of priority programs, and specifically stated, in the final rule,
that programs designed to prevent these fatalities are within the scope of this new priority program.

Are These School Bus Safety Measures Effective in Reducing Crashes, Injuries, and Fatalities?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, school buses already provide the safest form of transportation in our country. Since the number
of fatalities that are school bus-related is already so small, it is difficult to quantify the benefits of the actions
that have been taken. The agencies believe, however, that these measures are the ones most likely to reduce or eliminate
fatal and serious injuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Determination Regarding School Bus Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the agencies' review of the available material regarding the scope of the problem, including FHWA studies
regarding bus driver training and driver fatigue, we have determined that significant attention has been devoted
to school bus safety, and steps have been taken to improve the already excellent safety record of this mode of transportation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the successful measures already taken, the agencies do not view school bus transportation as a problem nearly
as significant as other highway safety program areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the states already have the ability under the section 402 program to address school bus and other highway
safety programs, and are proficient in allocating existing resources as they deem necessary to achieve maximum safety
benefits. In addition, the recent designation of Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety as a National Priority program area
has facilitated the States' ability to address the majority of school bus-related fatalities, which occur while
children are boarding or existing, not riding the bus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe that the establishment of School Bus Safety as a priority area could result in States shifting
402 funds away from other priority programs, and that the expenditure of an increased level of 402 funds in this manner
would not significantly affect the overall safety of school buses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agencies tentatively conclude that School Bus Safety should not be included as a National Priority
program at this time. The agencies wish to stress that this tentative decision should not be construed to imply that
the current resources focused upon School Bus Safety should be reduced or redirected. NHTSA and FHWA believe that
all existing efforts in this area should be continued to maintain the impressive safety record associated with school
bus transportation. The agencies hereby request data, statistics, and other substantive information relevant
to this determination.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those wishing to comment on this document should limit comments to the safety aspects of these two programs, and submit
data or statistics which demonstrate the extent of the nation's highway safety problem which is attributable to either
Speeding or School Bus Safety, along with any discussion of countermeasures which are or could be effective in reducing
the number of deaths and injuries in either of these two areas. In determining whether these programs should be identified
as National Priority Programs, the agencies will determine whether the problem is of national concern; whether effective
countermeasures have been developed to address the concern; and whether State programs appear to be among the most
effective as compared to other traffic safety program areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to expedite the submission of comments, simultaneous with issuance of this notice, copies of this notice
will be mailed to all Governors and Governors' Representatives for Highway Safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments should not exceed 15 pages in length. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. Necessary
attachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the 15-page limit. This limitation is intended
to encourage commenters to detail their primary arguments in a concise fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All comments received before the closing date indicated above will be considered, and will be available for examination
in the docket at the above address both before and after that date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the
closing date will also be considered. However, the rulemaking action may proceed at any time after that date. The agencies
will continue to file relevant material in the docket as it becomes available after the closing date, and it is recommended
that interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments in the docket should enclose, in the envelope
with their comments, a pre-addressed stamped postcard. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisor will

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies have considered the impacts that would be associated with this proposed action, and determined that
it is significant within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 and the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures since
it raises policy issues concerning the setting of priority programs. This rulemaking document was reviewed under
E.O. 12866. The rulemaking would not affect the level of funding available in the highway safety program, or otherwise
have a significant economic impact. The agency has prepared a Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation which is available
in the docket.

In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the agencies have evaluated the effects of this action on small
entities. Based on the evaluation, we certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. States will be recipients of any funds awarded under the regulation and, accordingly, the
preparation of a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is unnecessary.

The requirement relating to this proposal, that each State must submit a highway safety plan to receive section 402
grant funds, is considered to be an information collection requirement, as that term is defined by the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) in 5 CFR part 1320. Accordingly, these requirements have been submitted to and approved by OMB, pursuant
to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). These requirements have been approved through 11/30/95; OMB No. 2127&hyph;0501. This NPRM would establish no
new information collection requirement, as that term is defined by the OMB in 5 CFR part 1320.

This document reopens and extends the comment period for the notice of proposed rulemaking published on August 12,
1993 (58 FR 42918). This action is being taken because the Department was unable to publish the final rule before the
end of Fiscal Year 1993 and the Buy American requirements were again included in the Department of the Interior and
Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994 and the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1994. Pursuant
to these statutory provisions, the Department proposes to extend the requirements to Fiscal Year 1994, under the
same terms as set forth in the August 12, 1993 document.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 5, 1992, the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (``the
Act'') was signed into law. Section 319 of the Act was entitled ``Buy American Requirements.'' The section applied
to funds appropriated or transferred pursuant to the Act for the purchase of any equipment or product that may have
been authorized to be purchased with financial assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 319(b)(2) required that in providing financial assistance under the Act, the Secretary shall provide to
each recipient of the assistance a notice describing the Buy American requirement. No other specific Congressional
guidance was given regarding the implementation of this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department proposed to revise 43 CFR part 12, by adding subpart E to implement these requirements. Since no specific
guidance was provided by Congress, the Department decided to base its implementation upon similar rules in the Federal
Acquisition Regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;138, the ``Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994,'' and
Public Law 103&hyph;126, the ``Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1994,'' extend the Buy American
requirements to awards of financial assistance under the Department's general appropriation for Fiscal Year 1994,
as well as to similar awards by the Bureau of Reclamation. Because the statutes change no other portions of the Buy American
requirements, and because the Department was unable to issue a final rule prior to the enactment of the two statutes,
the Department now proposes to issue a final rule based on the proposed rule published on August 12, 1993. No other significant
changes are proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one public comment was received in response to the publication of the proposed rule. This action will allow for
the receipt of more comments to be considered prior to the publication of the final rule.

The Commission requests comments on a petition filed by Omak Community Broadcasters proposing the allotment of Channel
282C2 to Omak, Washington, as that community's second local FM transmission service. Channel 282C2 can be allotted
to Omak in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements with a site restriction of
16.5 kilometers (10.2 miles) south to avoid short-spacings to vacant allotment 281B, Trail, British Columbia and
Station KAFE, Channel 282C, Bellingham, Washington. The coordinates for Channel 282C2 at Omak are North Latitude
48&hyph;15&hyph;44 and West Longitude 119&hyph;31&hyph;58. Since Omak is located within 320 kilometers (200 miles)
of the U.S.-Canadian border, Canadian concurrence has been requested.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice invites written comments on a proposed revision which expresses GSA's expectation that offerors under
GSA procurements, in submitting required subcontracting plans, will do more than merely restate minimum plan requirements
described at FAR 52.219&hyph;9. GSA also expects subcontracting plans to demonstrate aggressiveness, creativity,
and innovation in involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns in subcontracting
opportunities and an understanding of the requirement that these concerns be afforded the maximum practicable opportunity
to perform as subcontractors in the offeror's procurements. In negotiated solicitations, the subcontracting plan
will be negotiated with price and any technical and management proposal required by the solicitation. In sealed bid
solicitations, target goals may be stated by GSA in the solicitation. GSA understands, however, that offerors' subcontracting
circumstances may vary greatly. The proposed revision also deletes various sections because they concern nonregulatory
material.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the GSA certifies that the proposed rule will not have significant impact on a substantial number of small entities,
since the revised subcontracting plan requirements in the proposed regulation will not apply to small business concerns.
Accordingly, an initial regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared.

The retitled provision at 552.219&hyph;73 contains an information collection requirement that is subject to the
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and it has been submitted to OMB for approval under the Act. Comments on the information collection may be submitted
to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for GSA, Washington, DC 20503.
The title of the information collection is ``GSAR 552.219&hyph;73 Preparation, Submission, and Negotiation of
Subcontracting Plans.'' The provision requires all offerors, other than small business concerns, responding to
a negotiated solicitation to submit a subcontracting plan with their respective offers so that a plan can be negotiated
concurrently with other parts of the proposal. The respondents are potential GSA contractors. The contracting officer
will use the information to evaluate whether GSA's expectation that subcontracting opportunities exist for small,
small disadvantaged and women-owned small business is reasonable under the circumstances; negotiate goals consistent
with statutory requirements and acquisition objectives; and expedite the award process. The estimated annual burden
for this additional collection is 14,690 hours. This is based on an estimated burden per response of 11.3 hours, a proposed
frequency of one response per respondent, and an estimated number of likely respondents of 1,300.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirement at FAR 19.702(a)(1) for submission of a subcontracting plan by only the apparently successful offeror
does not apply to GSA negotiated solicitations when the contract is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction).
Except for acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property using expedited procedures and those offering minimal
subcontracting opportunities, negotiated solicitations shall require submission with the initial offer of a subcontracting
plan in the format described in FAR 52.219&hyph;9 by all offerors that are not small business concerns. Where price
is the basis for award, such as multiple award schedule contracts, the plan will be evaluated and negotiated along
with price. In solicitations requiring technical and management proposals, the subcontracting plan will be included
as an evaluation factor or subfactor and negotiated concurrently with the technical, management, and price proposals.

The General Services Administration (GSA) is committed to assuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided
to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns to participate in the performance of this
contract consistent with its efficient performance. GSA expects any subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to
FAR 52.219&hyph;9 to reflect this commitment. Consequently, an offeror, other than a small business concern, before
being awarded a contract exceeding $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction) will be required to demonstrate that
its subcontracting plan represents an aggressive program for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned
small business concerns as subcontractors in the performance of this contract.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) An offeror, other than a small business concern, submitting an offer that exceeds $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction)
shall submit a subcontracting plan with its initial offer. The subcontracting plan will be negotiated concurrently
with price and any required technical and management proposals, unless the offeror submits a previously-approved
commercial products plan. Maximum practicable utilization of small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small
business concerns as subcontractors is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits. It is
the General Services Administration's (GSA's) expectation that an offeror's subcontracting plan will reflect
a commitment to assuring that small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns are provided
the maximum practicable opportunity, consistent with efficient contract performance, to participate as subcontractors
in the performance of the resulting contract.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) GSA believes that this potential contract provides significant opportunities for the use of small, small disadvantaged,
and women-owned small business concerns as subcontractors. Consequently, in addressing the eleven elements described
at FAR 52.219&hyph;9(d), the offeror shall demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents an aggressive program
for involving small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns in performing the contract.
The subcontracting plan shall include a description of the offeror's subcontracting strategies used in any previous
contracts, significant achievements, and how this plan will build upon those earlier achievements. Additionally,
the offeror shall demonstrate through its plan that it understands the small business subcontracting program's
objectives, GSA's expectations, and actions necessary to meet these goals and expectations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In determining the acceptability of any subcontracting plan, the Contracting Officer will_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Review the plan to verify that the offeror has demonstrated an understanding of the small business subcontracting
program's objectives and GSA's expectations with the respect to the program and has included all the information,
goals, and assurances required by FAR 52.219&hyph;9;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Consider previous goals and achievements of contractors in the same industry;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider information and potential sources obtained from agencies administering national and local preference
programs and other advocacy groups in evaluating whether the goals stated in the plan adequately reflect the anticipated
potential for subcontracting to small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business concerns; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Review, when applicable, the offeror's description of its strategies, historical performance and significant
achievements in placing subcontracts for the same or similar products or services with small, small disadvantaged,
and women-owned small business concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Failure to submit to subcontracting plan and/or correct deficiencies in the plan within the time specified by
the Contracting Officer shall make the offeror ineligible for award.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 By a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) served June 4, 1993, and published at 58 FR 32340, June 9, 1993, the Commission
instituted this proceeding to determine whether off-bill discounting where it does or may result in a misrepresentation
of shipping charges should be found to be an unreasonable practice or otherwise unlawful. However, the ``Negotiated
Rates Act of 1993'' (Pub. L. 103&hyph;180), since has been enacted and amends subchapter IV of chapter 107 of title
49, United States Code, by adding section 10767. Section 10767 requires that the Commission establish regulations
to prohibit, except for certain services, motor common and contract carriers of property from providing a reduction
in a tariff rate or contract rate to a person who is a nonpayer of freight charges. The Commission must issue these regulations
by April 2, 1994. Because section 10767 supersedes the NPR, the Commission is discontinuing this proceeding.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NMFS announces the intention of the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils (Councils) to prepare
an SEIS for proposed Amendment 2 to the Fishery Management Plan for Coral and Coral Reefs of the Gulf of Mexico and South
Atlantic (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the Councils and approved and implemented by the Secretary of Commerce under
provisions of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act). The purpose of Amendment 2 is
to manage the harvest of ``live rock,'' living marine organisms attached to a hard substrate, such as dead coral or
rock, and used primarily in the marine aquarium trade. Management measures under consideration include a prohibition
on, or phase-out of, harvest of live rock with possible provisions for aquaculture; establishment of an annual quota
or limited access management program; and implementation of a permitting system for wild harvest or aquaculture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Councils intend to conduct a continuing public process to determine the scope of issues to be addressed and to identify
the significant issues related to live rock management. The purpose of this notice is to inform the public of this ongoing
process and of the opportunity to participate by submitting written comments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1989, the Florida Department of Natural Resources (FDNR) (now Department of Environmental Protection) determined
that live rock harvest (i.e., the collection of rocks with marine organisms attached for use in home aquariums) was
detrimental to the Florida Reef Tract and other hard bottom habitat areas. The Florida Marine Fisheries Commission
(FMFC) noted that the only current net production of the carbonate substrate underlying live rock occurs on living
coral reefs and, in Florida, these areas are either in equilibrium or eroding. FDNR personnel testified that more
than 90 percent of the live rock examined at the request of enforcement agents contained visible colonies of prohibited
corals, such as stony corals and sea fans. The FMFC concluded that live rock removal (1) can violate State and Federal
laws that prohibit taking of corals, (2) reduces the surface area and topographic complexity of Florida's coral reefs
and other live bottom areas, and (3) removes entire micro- communities along with targeted aquarium species. As a
result of these consideration, Florida prohibited live rock landings from State waters in May 1989. As a result of
this rulemaking, live rock harvesting efforts shifted to the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off Florida.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FMFC has noted that in 1991 approximately 35 individuals reported combined landings of about 300 tons of live rock
from EEZ waters adjacent to the Florida Reef Tract, Florida's east coast reefs, and the Gulf of Mexico hard bottom areas.
In 1992, reported Florida landings from the EEZ totalled about 400 tons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Councils have discussed the live rock issue, particularly pertaining to EEZ waters over recent years,
they took no regulatory action since the FMFC had decided to initiate rulemaking regarding live rock landings from
the EEZ off Florida. Specifically, the Councils deferred action since Florida's planned phase-out of live rock landings
appeared to address what seemed to be a Florida area management issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1992, the Florida Governor and Cabinet approved the FMFC rule to phase-out live rock landings in Florida from
the EEZ over a 3-year period ending on June 30, 1995. The phase-out was designed to allow development of live rock aquaculture
which would be exempt from the eventual total harvest ban. The phase-out was to be accomplished by a 25 percent annual
reduction in allowable landings (based on the 1991 reported landings) accompanied by a 500 pound daily vessel limit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 31, 1993, a U.S. District Court Judge issued a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of Florida's
quota and vessel landing limits relating to possession or landing of live rock taken in the EEZ. Florida live rock fishermen
argued that the Magnuson Act superseded State landing laws and the Councils had made ``an affirmative and conscious
decision'' not to prohibit the taking of live rock in the EEZ.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the District Court action, the Councils are now concerned that removal of live rock from the EEZ is currently
unregulated. Also, there is a growing interest in harvest of live rock from North Carolina to Alabama. In April 1993,
the South Atlantic Council approved a motion to include live rock in the FMP and reactivate the Coral Advisory Panel.
In May 1993, the Gulf Council, on being advised of recent live rock landings in Alabama, and at the request of that State
and Florida, initiated development of options for live rock management. In June 1993, the South Atlantic Council
held a public scoping meeting in Duck Key, Florida, to solicit input from the harvesters and the general public on the
management of live rock. In November 1993, the Councils prepared a draft Amendment 2 to the FMP to address live rock
issues, and established a schedule for further public hearings. See

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Permits: a. provide for a Federal permit for wild live rock harvest and possession; b. provide for a Federal permit
for possession and harvest of live rock from aquaculture; and c. provide for a Federal permit to take prohibited live
rock for scientific and educational purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The South Atlantic Council's Habitat and Environmental Protection Committee prefers a prohibition on harvest and
possession of live rock on implementation of Amendment 2, possibly as early as 1994. The Gulf Council prefers to allow
three years of continued harvest after implementation of Amendment 2 to allow additional time for harvesters to convert
to aquaculture; subsequently, harvest and possession of live rock would be limited to persons with aquaculture permits.

The South Atlantic Council is holding public hearings on live rock management on January 5, 1994, in Savannah, Georgia,
on January 6 in Duck Key, Florida, and on January 13 in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. The Gulf Council will hold
hearings on January 11, in Pensacola, Florida, and on January 19, in Clearwater Beach, Florida. Specific times and
locations are available from the Gulf Council listed above. The Gulf Council is scheduled to take action on the draft
amendment and a draft SEIS at its January 19 meeting in Clearwater Beach, Florida. The South Atlantic Council is scheduled
to take action on these draft documents at its February 7&hyph;11 meeting in St. Augustine, Florida. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft SEIS is expected to be filed with the Environmental Protection agency in February or March 1994 for public
review and comment. Following a 45-day public comment period, a final SEIS will be prepared in support of the final
Amendment 2 to be submitted by the Councils to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval (expected by 1994).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 To improve the administration of discretionary grants and to clarify for grantees the procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and requirements of the Department, the Secretary is proposing to revise sections in the Education Department General
Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) on indirect cost rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of problems in this area of grants administration will be addressed by the proposed changes. For example,
the use of a restricted indirect cost rate for programs with supplement-not-supplant language in their authorizing
statutes is required by current regulations. However, State education agencies have incurred significant financial
liabilities by using incorrect restricted indirect cost rates. The proposed changes clarify how these rates are
calculated and so will reduce the likelihood of those errors recurring. In addition, the term ``occupancy and space
maintenance costs'' as used in the computation of restricted indirect cost rates has not been clearly defined, resulting
in grant recipients being reimbursed improperly for space costs. The inclusion of a definition in these proposed
regulations will address this problem.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The absence of a training grant definition has led to disagreements between the Department and grant recipients over
whether the training rate of eight percent, which is a lower rate than most recipients' negotiated rate, should be
applied to certain grants. The proposed definition will alleviate this problem and improve the Department's ability
to effectively administer these grants. Similarly, ambiguities in existing regulations on the use of indirect costs
for matching or cost-sharing and on the reimbursement of indirect costs to groups of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligible parties has contributed to administrative problems between the Department and its grant recipients. The
proposed changes will clarify for all parties how these special situations are to be handled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing regulations in these sections are being revised and reorganized and new sections are being added. Specifically,
the following sections are proposed for revision or addition: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.129_This section is revised to include a reference to a new requirement in &sect;75.564 on the determination
of indirect costs for a grant to a group of eligible parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.560_This section is revised to include the requirements that a grantee claiming indirect costs must have
a current indirect cost rate agreement, that the Secretary may establish a temporary indirect cost rate under certain
circumstances, and that the Secretary may establish a restricted indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the regulatory

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of certain programs administered by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.561_This section is revised to clarify the approval period for indirect cost rates established by the
Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.562_This section is revised and expanded to include a definition of a training grant, a statement that
the Secretary decides which grants are training grants, a clarification of the base to which the training rate is applied,
and a restatement of the existing requirement that indirect costs in excess of the eight percent limitation may not
be charged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly or be used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements. It also explains that a grantee must have documentation
available to show that its negotiated indirect cost rate is at least eight percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.563_This section is revised to refer grantees subject to a restricted indirect cost rate to the new sections
in part 76 on restricted rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections 75.564 through 75.568 are removed in order to transfer these sections on restricted indirect cost rates
to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 76. Since most grants under restricted rate programs are made to agencies of State or local governments, or their
subgrantees, the Secretary is proposing this change to clarify the applicability of these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 75.564_This is a new section that includes several requirements applicable to the reimbursement of indirect
costs, including clarification on the use of indirect costs to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements and
the reimbursement of indirect costs under a grant to a group of eligible parties. The exclusion of certain categories
of grants from reimbursement for indirect costs is proposed, since these types of grants have very little overhead
or administrative costs associated with them. This exclusion is consistent with the current policy of the Department
of Health and Human Services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 76.560_This section is revised to include the requirements that a grantee claiming indirect costs must have
a current indirect cost rate agreement, that the Secretary may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a temporary indirect cost rate under certain circumstances, and that the Secretary may establish a restricted
indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the statutory requirements of certain programs administered by the Department.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 76.563 is revised to indicate the new sections in part 76 that apply to grantees subject to a restricted indirect
cost rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 76.564_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current &sect;75.564 and also includes the requirement
that indirect costs not recovered as a result of the restrictions may not be charged directly or charged to other Federal
awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 76.565_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current &sect;75.565. The term ``general management
costs'' is substituted for ``administrative charges'' to avoid confusion with the latter term as it is used in other
regulations. The section explains that the term general management costs includes some occupancy and space maintenance
costs. It also clarifies what is meant by the terms ``chief executive officer,'' which is used in place of ``chief administrative
officer,'' and ``component'' as these terms are used in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 76.566_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current &sect;75.566 and clarifies which fringe
benefits may be used in determining fixed costs in a restricted rate calculation.

Section 76.567_This new section incorporates the provisions of the current &sect;75.567 and explains that the term
``other expenditures'' also includes some occupancy and space maintenance costs and costs related to chief executive
officers and their offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 76.568_This is a new section that defines what is meant by occupancy and space maintenance costs in the computation
of restricted indirect cost rates. The section also describes the limited circumstances in which those costs can
be charged directly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 76.569_This is a new section that revises the formula currently in &sect;75.568 for computing indirect costs
under a restricted rate program to clarify the base to which the rate is applied.

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order
the Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations are those resulting from statutory requirements and
those determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering this program effectively and efficiently. Burdens
specifically associated with information collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained elsewhere
in this preamble under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations,
the Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed regulations justify the costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary has also determined that this regulatory action does not unduly interfere with State, local, and tribal
governments in the exercise of their governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce any potential costs or increase potential benefits
resulting from these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and efficient administration of the program.

The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. For the most part these revisions are proposed to provide additional information to grantees
and to clarify existing departmental procedures or requirements. The proposed revisions will not result in major
changes in departmental policy that might have significant economic impact on small entities.

Indirect cost rates for educational training projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Educational training grants provide funding for training or other educational services. Examples of the work
supported by training grants are summer institutes, training programs for selected participants, the introduction
of new or expanded courses, and similar instructional undertakings, including special research training programs,
that are separately budgeted and accounted for by the sponsoring institution. These grants do not usually support
activities involving research, development, and dissemination of new educational materials and methods. Training
grants largely implement previously developed materials and methods and require no significant adaptation of techniques
or instructional services to fit different circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The Secretary determines which grants are educational training grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Indirect cost reimbursement on a training grant is limited to the amount computed by applying the grantee's negotiated
indirect cost rate or a rate of eight percent, whichever is less, to a modified total direct cost base determined by
the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The eight percent limit also applies to cost-type contracts under grants, if these contracts are for training
as defined in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The eight percent limit does not apply to agencies of State or local governments, including federally recognized
Indian tribal governments, as defined in 34 CFR 80.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Indirect costs in excess of the eight percent limit may not be charged directly, used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing
requirements, or be charged to another Federal award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A grantee using the training rate of eight percent is required to have documentation available for audit that shows
that its negotiated indirect cost rate is at least eight percent.

Reimbursement of indirect costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Reimbursement of indirect costs is subject to the availability of funds and statutory or administrative restrictions.
The extent to which indirect costs are reimbursed is a matter for determination between the Secretary and the grantee.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The application of the rates and the determination of the direct cost base by a grantee must be in accordance with
the indirect cost rate agreement approved by the grantee's cognizant Federal agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Indirect cost reimbursement is not allowable under grants for_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(d) Indirect cost reimbursement on grants received under programs with statutory restrictions or other limitations
on indirect costs must be made in accordance with the restrictions in 34 CFR 76.564&hyph;76.569. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Under programs with matching or cost-sharing requirements, indirect costs that are unallowable as charges to
Federal funds may not be used to satisfy matching or cost-sharing requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Indirect costs for a group of eligible parties (see &sect;&sect;75.127&hyph;75.129) are limited to the amount
derived by applying the rate of the applicant, or a restricted rate when applicable, to the grant in keeping with the
terms of the applicant's indirect cost rate agreement.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL Program consists of the Federal Stafford, Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Consolidation Loan programs. These amendments are needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended (HEA), by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations would amend the FFEL Program loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation provisions and enhance the ability of lenders and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agencies to service and collect FFEL Program loans.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary is proposing to revise 34 CFR part 682 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325), enacted July 23, 1992, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as certain changes added by Public Law 103&hyph;208, enacted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 20, 1993. These regulations seek to improve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency of federal student aid programs, and, by so doing, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education.

Summary of Comments From Regional Meetings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In compliance with section 492(a) of the HEA, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convened regional meetings during September 1992 to obtain public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involvement in the development of proposed regulations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of the meetings was to ``provide for a comprehensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion and exchange of information concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation'' of certain parts of Public Law 102&hyph;325. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, attendees at the regional meetings were asked to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominate individuals to act as negotiators in the negotiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking process required by section 492(b) of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regional meetings were conducted for two days each in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
San Francisco, California; New York, New York; Atlanta, Georgia; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Kansas City, Missouri. Each participant at the regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meetings was assigned to one of six groups which were asked to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discuss particular issue areas identified by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each group at the regional meetings prepared a report of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion and recommendations and those reports were presented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Department for consideration during the preparation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issues addressed in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were discussed by one of the groups at each regional meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific recommendations made at those meetings are addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below. The Secretary considered these comments in preparing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
draft proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Loan Discharge for Borrowers Attending Schools That 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Close 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 102&hyph;325 added section 437(c) to the HEA to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that loans will be canceled for student borrowers who are unable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to complete their program of study because the school closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific issues described below were discussed in connection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with this section.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute requires that, to qualify for a cancellation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower must be ``unable to complete his or her program'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the school closed. Participants at the San Francisco 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting recommended that the cancellation be available to student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowers who are in attendance at the school at the time the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school closes, or are on a leave of absence or left the school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 60 days prior to the school's closure because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deteriorating conditions at the school. The participants at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New York meeting agreed that students who are registered at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time the school closed should have their loans canceled but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the benefit also be provided to borrowers who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
left within 90 days prior to the school's closure. Participants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the Kansas City meeting endorsed the 60-day time frame but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also recommended that the regulations focus on the date of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
announcement that the school is closing if that is earlier than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the actual date that the school closed. Participants at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Atlanta meeting recommended that loan cancellation be provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students who are in attendance or on a leave of absence at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time the school closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Prior Payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants at all of the meetings agreed that any payments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by the borrower prior to discharge of the loan should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refunded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Teach-Outs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants at the meetings discussed whether a loan made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a student who is offered a teach-out of the program in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student was enrolled should be canceled. The participants at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Atlanta meeting concluded that a loan should not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharged if the student completed a teach-out during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic year for which the loan was made, but that the loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be discharged if the borrower did not take or did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete a teach-out during that time. Participants at the New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York and Kansas City meetings concluded that a borrower should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the option of whether to accept a teach-out and should have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the loan discharged if the student does not choose or does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete a teach-out program. Attendees at the San Francisco 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting stated that they believed that teach-outs do not work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well in practice and that loans should be canceled if a borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not choose to complete the program through a teach-out. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
d. Extent of Cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Attendees at each of the meetings also discussed whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans should be canceled only for the academic term for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower received the loan or whether all loans received for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program should be canceled. Attendees at the Atlanta meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreed that only the loan made for the period in which the school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed should be canceled. Participants at the meetings in New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York and San Francisco (and a substantial minority in Atlanta) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the regulations distinguish between students 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrolled in certificate programs and students enrolled in degree 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The attendees at those meetings believed that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate students were unlikely to be able to transfer the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credits earned at the closed school and should have all loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canceled, but that students attending degree-granting schools are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to be able to transfer their credits and should only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive cancellation of the loan for the period in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
e. Process and Documentation Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Attendees at the San Francisco meeting recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary be responsible for notifying the guaranty agencies when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a school closes and that the agencies would be responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notifying the lenders of the loans eligible for cancellation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The attendees at that meeting also recommended that collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity be suspended on the affected loans and that public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service announcements be used to notify possibly affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students but that the students not be required to complete any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications or paperwork to prove their entitlement. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attendees at the Atlanta meeting also recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary or a State agency be responsible for determining that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school has closed and that the agencies would notify the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lenders. The attendees at that meeting also recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower not be required to provide documentation and recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that credit bureau reporting be suspended during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation of possibly affected loans. Attendees at the New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York meeting recommended that the date of a school's closure be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the applicable State licensing authority and also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the student not be required to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation of eligibility for cancellation of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Discharge of Loans for Borrowers Whose Eligibility was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Falsely Certified by the School
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 437(c) to the HEA also provided that loans will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canceled for borrowers whose eligibility to borrow was falsely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified by the school. The specific issues described below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were discussed in connection with this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Definition of ``False Certification'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants at the San Francisco meeting recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department's regulations provide that the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations should be considered ``false certification:'' a school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifies an application for a borrower who is not eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because he or she does not have the ability to benefit from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training offered; there is fraud by the school in completing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifying the loan application or the school cashes checks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the borrower's endorsement; or the school submits an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorrect budget, wrong expected family contribution, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information vital to the determination of the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility. The participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the definition of ``false certification'' include forged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checks, falsification of the student's program eligibility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for a particular loan amount, and falsification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower's signature. Participants at the New York meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that the Department define ``false certification'' as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the situation in which the school falsely certifies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is an eligible institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Need for Showing of Intent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants at the San Francisco meeting recommended that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations provide that ``false certification'' must relate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the school's intent to deceive and not include a clerical error. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The participants at the New York meeting, who also discussed this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issue, did not reach a consensus regarding the requirement for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
showing of intent by the school. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
c. Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only the attendees at the Atlanta meeting discussed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures that should be utilized in implementing the provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for discharge of loans in cases of false certification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations provide that the determination of a false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification can be made by the Department, the guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency, or the courts. They also recommended that if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency makes the decision, the regulations should allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the school to appeal that decision to the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants at that meeting also recommended that a lender be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to notify the guaranty agency within 30 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving a complaint that a loan was falsely certified and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection activity be suspended while the agency investigates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the claim. The agency would be required to complete its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigation within 6 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Repayment of Bankruptcy Claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 102&hyph;325 changed the procedure for payment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bankruptcy claims by the Department and requires the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repay the loan if collection of the loan is stayed under Title 11 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Bankruptcy Code. Participants at all of the regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meetings recommended that the Department define ``stay'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the current definition in the Bankruptcy Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in response to the Department's question regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate procedure for handling loans that are not ultimately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharged in bankruptcy, there were differences of opinion. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attendees at the San Francisco meeting recommended that if a loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not likely to be discharged by the bankruptcy court, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency should obtain the loan from the lender and hold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it until the bankruptcy court action is completed and then return 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it to the lender. Attendees at the New York meeting recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lenders be permitted to file bankruptcy claims for payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly to the Secretary and if the Secretary wanted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency to service the account, the agency should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted to receive at least a portion of any repayment. They 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also recommended that the lender be given the option to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repurchase any loan that is not discharged in bankruptcy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants at the Atlanta meeting recommended that lenders be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to repurchase any loans not discharged on which a claim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was paid. Because this amendment has now been superseded by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 2(c)(63) of Public Law 103&hyph;208, which incorporated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions found in current FFEL Program regulations, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments are now moot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Garnishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The last statutory provision reflected in these proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations is section 488A of the HEA, which establishes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national wage garnishment law. That section was added by Public Law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
102&hyph;164, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not discussed during the regional meetings or the negotiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking sessions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Negotiated Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After completion of the regional meetings, the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared draft proposed regulations to implement the provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Public Law 102&hyph;325 relating to the FFEL Program. In accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the requirements of section 492(b) of the HEA, those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations were submitted to a negotiated rulemaking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the weeks of January 4&hyph;8 and February 1&hyph;5, 1993, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department met with negotiators selected from among individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nominated by attendees at the regional meetings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discussion below of the proposed regulations reflects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those areas where the negotiators reached a consensus and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations reflect that agreement. The discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below also indicates where consensus was not reached during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations. However, the negotiators did not choose to discuss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every part of the proposed regulations. Accordingly, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion below of those issues not discussed during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations reflects only the views of the Secretary.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Regulatory Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 682.202&blank;Permissible Charges by Lenders to Borrowers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 427A of the HEA. The changes in this section include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creation of variable interest rates for new Stafford loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowers and the return of excess interest to certain Stafford 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary estimates that lenders collectively will need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an additional 250,000 hours to comply with the requirement that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excess interest be returned to certain Stafford loan borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This requirement is taken directly from the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 682.208&blank;Due Diligence in Servicing a Loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 428(b)(2)(F) of the HEA. Under the regulations, in cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the holder of the loan remains the same, but there is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
servicing change that results in a change in the identity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
party to whom the borrower must send payments or direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communications, the Secretary would apply the same borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification requirements that are required by current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations at 34 CFR 682.208(e) when a loan is sold or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary does not view this requirement as one that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposes any additional burden because lenders and servicers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already notify borrowers, as a normal business practice, whenever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a servicing change that results in a change in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identity of the party to whom the borrower must send payments or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct communications. This requirement is taken directly from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The proposed regulations would implement the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 437 of the HEA. The regulations reflect the new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory provision for cancellation of a parent's PLUS loan if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student for whom the parent borrowed died. This was not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject of controversy at the regional meetings or during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations implement the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA with regard to the discharge of a borrower's liability on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL Program loan if the student was unable to complete an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
educational program because of the closure of the school. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing criteria to be used to determine a borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility for a closed school loan discharge, the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that a student who completed his or her educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program by transferring academic credits or hours earned at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed school to another school, or who completed the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through a teach-out of the educational program at a different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school, should not qualify for a loan cancellation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary believes that the closed school discharge was intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to benefit students who could not complete their education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because their school closed, and does not believe that a student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who was able to complete the educational program for which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan paid should be able to avoid repaying that loan. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary is particularly interested in receiving public comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as to the appropriate treatment of a borrower's loan obligations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the educational program for which the loan was obtained was a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multi-year program and the student was able to complete one or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more years of that program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also believes, contrary to the majority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sentiment expressed at the regional meetings and by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiators, that a borrower should submit to the holder a sworn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement that demonstrates that the borrower is eligible for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed school discharge to assist the Secretary or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's designees in pursuing claims against the closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school, and to secure the borrower
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s written commitment to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representations on which he or she seeks relief. The Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that an affidavit or sworn statement is essential in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protecting the interests of the federal taxpayer, and therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes that one be obtained from the student as a condition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan discharge. By virtue of Federal law (28 U.S.C. 1746), this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affidavit or statement need not be notarized, but the borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must state in the document that the borrower makes the statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under penalty of perjury.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary agrees with the sentiment expressed at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regional meetings and by the negotiators that conditions at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school immediately preceding its closing may cause a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deterioration in the educational program that would cause a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student to withdraw. A student who withdraws under these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances should be deemed to have been unable to complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her educational program because of the school's closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of considering the borrower eligible for loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge, and to balance the interests of the borrower and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federal taxpayers (who ultimately must pay the cost of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancelled loan), the Secretary proposes to limit this withdrawal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period to not more than 90 days prior to the date the school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed.

False Certification by a School of a Student's Eligibility To

Borrow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants in the regional meetings and the negotiators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offered a wide variety of different actions by the school or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower that they believed should be considered a false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification of eligibility to borrow; these included virtually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every express or implied representation in any way related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FFEL Program made by the student to the school, or by the school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the lender, guarantor, accrediting agency, state authority, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary. The Secretary has not adopted these views in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations, because the language of the statute itself 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and its legislative history shows that the intended scope of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority to discharge loan obligations is considerably narrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than these commenters suggest. The statute authorizes discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only if the school made a false ``certification of the student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility,'' a term used only in the FFEL Program regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where it refers, only to those representations made by the school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the loan application itself regarding the status of the loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant (or the student for whom a parent wishes to obtain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PLUS loan) as an eligible student, 34 CFR 682.603; 682.201; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
668.7, and not to other written representations that relate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower's request for a loan, the school's participation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FFEL Program, or the quality of the school
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
s program, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, or placement services. The legislative history 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further explains that this provision was intended to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief where the student was ``left without the skills needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain employment'' because of the false certification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility. H. R. Rep. No. 447, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. 52 (1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope of the relief proposed by the Secretary here is guided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by these two principles: that the false certification be that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by the school on the loan application regarding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's eligibility, and that the falsity of the certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be directly related to the failure to provide necessary skills 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for employment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some negotiators urged that grounds for cancellation should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include such falsifications as forgery of the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signature on the loan application or on the loan disbursement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
check. However, these representations are not part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process of the ``certification of the student's eligibility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrow.'' Moreover, as a practical matter, a borrower victimized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a forged loan application can be injured only if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's endorsement is then forged on the loan disbursement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
check, or the check is negotiated without the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endorsement at all. In either case, the borrower is generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not liable because such a loan is generally not legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforceable. Therefore, not only does forgery not constitute a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
falsification in the loan ``certification'' process, but the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower who is the victim of a forgery and did not receive the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeds of the loan already has a complete defense to repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the loan, and needs no cancellation relief under this new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other negotiation participants suggested that erroneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school representations on a loan application regarding such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matters as the borrower's (or student's) income, resources, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family contribution, or recommended loan amount should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to constitute grounds for cancellation under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. This kind of error could result in the borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving a loan in a larger amount than he or she qualifies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive. However, that student may nevertheless receive quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training at the school, and this kind of error or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misrepresentation does not directly or invariably cause the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower to be ``left without the skills needed to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment.'' In addition, errors or misstatements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's financial need frequently result in the borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving a loan either that only marginally exceeds the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for which he or she actually qualified, or that qualified only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for reinsurance but not for interest subsidies. Section 437(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directs the discharge of the ``borrower's liability on the loan''_language that does not suggest that a partial discharge
was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemplated or intended; discharging the borrower from financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation for the entire loan in such circumstances where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misstatement of financial need affects only part of the loan, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only the borrower's right to interest subsidies on all or part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that loan, is a remedy completely out of proportion to any injury 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suffered by the borrower as a result of the erroneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification of his or her financial need. For these reasons, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary concludes that erroneous representations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's financial need are not the kind of false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifications for which section 437 was intended to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, participants at the regional meetings and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiations recognized that grounds for cancellation of a loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation under section 437 of the HEA should include a case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where a student was unable to obtain employment after attending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the school, and the school had falsely certified that the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had the ability to benefit from the school's training. This kind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of falsification is both part of the loan certification process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and results in a student being left without needed skills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed regulations focus on the school's false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representation that the student had the ability to benefit as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grounds for cancellation under this new provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute and regulations have addressed the ability-to-benefit requirement for many years, and the proposed
regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect both the legal elements of that requirement and some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement perspectives developed in implementing it. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, the school has always been required to test the ability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to benefit only of those applicants who did not have a high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school diploma, and the school therefore does not certify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anything regarding the ability to benefit of high school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
graduates. Since 1987, students who had a general education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diploma, or obtained one after enrolling, and students who lacked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both a GED and a high school diploma but completed an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutionally prescribed remedial education program, have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed by Congress to have the ability to benefit, and the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would incorporate that congressional judgement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations therefore would generally permit relief in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case of a student whom the school was required to test for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to benefit, but either failed to test at all, or tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in disregard of the requirements for proper use of the test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. Schools have a continuing legal obligation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administer tests, subject to criteria developed by the school's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accreditor, in compliance with test protocols. These criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and protocols may include requirements related both to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy of the test results as to the individual tested and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the continuing development and validation of the test mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Non-compliance with testing requirements may warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative sanctions against the school, but a false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification claim under this provision requires the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine a different question. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A false certification claim depends not on whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school met all its obligations with regard to testing, but on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a test already given lacks credibility as a measure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student's ability to benefit so that the Department should, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the absence of other evidence, regard the student as lacking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that ability. The Secretary expects that practical, specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards will be needed to help identify those deviations from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing requirements that support an inference that the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lacked ability to benefit. For example, use of photocopied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
versions of tests by the school or test administrator may violate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements of the test publisher, but may have no direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on the accuracy of the assessment of the student's ability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to benefit. Use of an indefensibly low cutoff score by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school on an ability-to-benefit test does not discredit an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of the ability of those students who score above a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legitimate cutoff score, such as those now published by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary. Similarly, minor deviations from required time limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may have little effect on the validity of the test results. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary intends to address these practical considerations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final regulations, and invites public comment on the content 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of those standards or guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In applying these standards, moreover, the Secretary has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistently recognized that a student may actually have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to benefit from the school's training even though the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school does not test that student's ability or does so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improperly. The proposed regulations therefore recognize that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student who actually obtains employment in the occupation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the school's program was designed to prepare him or her had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the actual ability to benefit from that training without regard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to whether the school falsified its test of ability to benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A student not properly tested for ability to benefit who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nevertheless completes the program of instruction can reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered to have found the training consistent with his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her aptitude, and the proposed regulations would provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation only if the a student had unsuccessfully tried to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
find employment in the occupation for which the program was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to prepare him or her. Conversely, a student not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly tested who withdraws from the course can be reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarded as having found the training not consistent with his or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her aptitude, and the proposed regulations grant relief to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kind of student (or a parent PLUS borrower who borrowed on behalf 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the student) unless the student actually obtained employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in that occupation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the approach that the student's ability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit should be evaluated realistically, the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations would recognize that those individuals admitted on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basis of their ability to benefit who met one or more of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several statutory requirements would nevertheless be regarded as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not having had that ability if they had a physical, mental, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personal impediment to employment in, or performance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical duties of, the occupation for which the program was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed. Individuals with certain kinds of criminal records or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a history of mental illness may be barred from some positions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the school proposed to train them, and these students could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not benefit from the training even if they successfully completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a test sanctioned by both the industry and school's accrediting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency. Other students may lack the physical ability to perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a job for which their grades on an industry and accreditor-approved test might otherwise show an ability to perform.
Both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
kinds of students would qualify (or qualify the parent PLUS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower) for relief under these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of other kinds of falsification were considered as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential grounds for discharge of the loan under this provision, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including a school's acceptance of a student into an ineligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, but they were not adopted in these proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained earlier, the statute uses fairly precise language to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describe the grounds for discharge under this provision, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language, by authorizing discharge where there has been a false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification ``by the eligible institution,'' does not authorize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief where the falsity relates to the eligibility of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution itself. Thus, although misrepresentations regarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the school's financial or administrative capability, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the school's placement services or the quality of the school's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, faculty, or equipment, may well have induced the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual to enroll at the school, those representations are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the process of ``certification'' of the student's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eligibility to borrow, tend to constitute claims that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution was in fact not an ``eligible institution,'' and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not the kind of representations for which this statute authorizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief. These proposed regulations therefore do not treat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
falsifications by the institution about itself as grounds for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the vocational schools that are the primary focus of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this statutory provision, representations about the eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the institution include representations about the eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its programs, and, under the statute and regulations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution is virtually defined in terms of the programs it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offers. 20 U.S.C. 1088 (1992); 34 CFR 600.7, 668.7(a)(2)(v). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, because the statute confines relief precisely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances of false certifications regarding the eligibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student, not on representations that would tend to show that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the institution itself was not eligible, the Secretary does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that the statute authorizes relief where the alleged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misrepresentation goes to the eligibility of the program in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the student was enrolled. For these reasons, relief under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations would not permit a borrower to secure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancellation by challenging the eligibility of the program or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school itself, but would require a demonstration by the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the school failed to test (or tested improperly) his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to benefit and that he or she did not secure employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the occupation for which the school stated its program was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to prepare the student.

Section 437(a) of the HEA as amended by the Higher Education 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendments of 1992 allowed a lender to submit and receive payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a bankruptcy claim on the date on which the borrower filed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief in bankruptcy, an action that ``stays collection'' of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan, rather than when the loan was discharged, as under prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law. The proposed regulations submitted to the negotiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process would have revised current regulations as needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement this change. Other features of current bankruptcy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim processing were to remain unchanged. Section 2(c)(63) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;208 reinstated standards for payment of bankruptcy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claims consistent with those now found in FFEL Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations at 34 CFR 682.402(d)(5); pursuant to section 5 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Law 103&hyph;208, this most recent change took effect as if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enacted as part of the 1992 amendments. Any regulations needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to implement this change, moreover, are not subject to negotiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking requirements of section 492. To implement the new law, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary is here withdrawing those proposals found in 34 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
682.402(f)(5) and (g)(2) (iv) and (v) as presented to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negotiators prior to the enactment of Public Law 103&hyph;208, and will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leave in effect the provisions of current 34 CFR 682.402(d)(5), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
redesignated here as &sect;682.402(g)(5), and current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By allowing a filing of a claim on the date ``collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the loan is stayed''_the date of the filing of the petition by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower, or, in a Chapter 13 case, by the endorser or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower_rather than the date a borrower receives a discharge, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statute might be read to permit claims to be submitted if an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endorser files, rather than, as under prior law, only in borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bankruptcies. Nothing in the amendments suggested that such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result was intended, and the proposed regulations would permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the submission of a bankruptcy claim only in the case of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower bankruptcy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations would continue to require lenders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to file proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding, unless the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency directs otherwise or the holder is officially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notified by the court that no assets are available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution. If the guaranty agency later receives notice that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assets have become available, the guarantor must file a proof of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
claim at that point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants in the negotiated rulemaking proceedings noted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a growing number of discharges were being received by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrowers who file sequential bankruptcy petitions, particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those who first file for relief in Chapter 13. During the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pendency of the prior bankruptcy case, loans in repayment less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than seven years are non-dischargeable without proof of undue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hardship, yet cannot be enforced by the holder according to their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original terms; little or nothing may be paid on those loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the proceeding. Rather than attempting to show that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment would constitute an undue hardship, or negotiating an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income-sensitive repayment arrangement with the holder, borrowers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who complete their Chapter 13 proceeding may then file a second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bankruptcy petition, making sure that the second is filed more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than seven years after the loan entered repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bankruptcy Code excludes the period of ``any applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspension of the repayment period'' from the seven-year period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during which loans are dischargeable only for undue hardship. 11 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 523(a)(8)(A). If the term ``suspension of the repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period'' is read, as these borrowers contend, to include only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forbearance or deferments granted by the holder of the loan, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reality of the forbearance imposed by virtue of the automatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stay in the prior bankruptcy_which barred enforcement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan according to its terms during the pendency of the bankruptcy_would be ignored, and borrowers who have neither
made the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required seven-year attempt to repay nor demonstrated undue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hardship would obtain a discharge in the second bankruptcy. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary does not consider this interpretation of the statute to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be consistent with its purpose, and the only court that has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed this precise issue has concluded that the period during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which enforcement of a loan is stayed in a prior bankruptcy is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``applicable suspension of the repayment period'' for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computing the seven-year period for a subsequent bankruptcy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
re Saburah,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 136 B.R. 246, 254 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the above discussion, the Secretary proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpret the term ``applicable suspension of the repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period'' to include periods during which the automatic stay in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bankruptcy proceeding is in effect. The Secretary further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that a borrower who in fact meets his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation under the original repayment agreement during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bankruptcy has acted in a manner consistent with the intent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statute, and this proposed interpretation would not regard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of the first bankruptcy as a period of suspension of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment for the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The death and bankruptcy requirements in proposed &sect;682.402 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are taken directly from the HEA. There is no change to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current disability cancellation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Closed School Cancellations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The closed school cancellation provision is taken, in large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part, directly from the mandates of the HEA, although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations reflect some areas of necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation. The discussion that follows is grouped into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three major areas where the Secretary and the negotiators had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion to interpret the statutory closed school cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Student Withdrawal Prior to the Closing of the School
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There was unanimous agreement among the negotiators and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary that it would be inequitable to strictly limit a closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school cancellation to only those students who were in attendance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the school on the date that the school officially closed. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed earlier, conditions at the school immediately preceding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its closing may have caused a deterioration in the educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program that would have prompted a student to withdraw. Such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student should not lose entitlement to a loan cancellation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of his or her prescience or inability to tolerate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school's deterioration. To balance the interests of students and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the federal taxpayers (who ultimately must pay the cost of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancelled loan), the Secretary proposes to limit this withdrawal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period to not more than 90 days prior to the date the school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Student Use of Teach-out or Transfer of Academic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Credits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed earlier, the Secretary does not believe that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
student who completed the educational program for which the loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was intended, even though the completion occurred through a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
teach-out at another school or by the student's transfer of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academic credits earned at the closed school, should be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid repaying that loan. The student is not required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer those credits or make use of a teach-out opportunity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but if the student chooses to do so, then the Secretary believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, because the student was able to complete the educational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, it would be unfair to require the Federal taxpayer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay the student's loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Student Statement Requirement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes that a statement made by the student 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under penalty of perjury demonstrating eligibility for a closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school discharge should be obtained from the student to assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary or the Secretary's designees in pursuing claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against the closed school. Without this statement, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary's ability to protect the interests of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer would be frustrated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 682.410&blank;Fiscal, Administrative, and Enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The administrative wage garnishment requirements are taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly from the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide an alternative to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed collection requirements in &sect;682.410(b) if a guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency uses collection agencies and administrative wage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
garnishment. Through these regulations, the Secretary expects to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximize default collections by the Department of Education, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agencies, and the Internal Revenue Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations implement the national wage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
garnishment provision in section 488A of the HEA, under which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agencies or the Secretary may garnish up to 10 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the wages of a borrower who has defaulted on an FFEL Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan or who is not making required payments under a repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement. Under the proposed regulations, at least 30 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before garnishment proceedings are initiated the borrower must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given written notice informing him or her of the nature and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the loan obligation to be collected, the intention of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the guaranty agency to initiate proceedings to collect the debt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through deductions from pay, and an explanation of the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rights regarding the proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide the borrower with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to inspect and copy records related to the debt, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a new repayment agreement, and receive a hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the existence or amount of the debt and the terms of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment schedule. In addition, no withholding of a debtor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wages may occur in the case of an individual who has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involuntarily separated from employment until that individual has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations would replace current regulatory provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that authorize wage garnishment by guaranty agencies in certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 488A of the HEA protects borrowers by prohibiting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employers from taking disciplinary action against an individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the fact that the individual's wages are subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
garnishment. The statute permits a borrower to sue an employer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who takes such an action, and authorizes the court to award 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attorneys' fees, punitive damages, back pay, reinstatement, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other remedies the court believes reasonably necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 488A(a) of the HEA preempts state laws that might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibit garnishment to collect student loan debts. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary particularly requests comments on whether there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other state laws that might frustrate the purpose of section 488A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and should be preempted. The Secretary asks commenters to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide specific information on those laws.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations implement the requirements of the

the possibility that their wages may be garnished by the guaranty

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations have been reviewed in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Executive Order 12866. Under the terms of the order the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has assessed the potential costs and benefits of this

regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential costs associated with the proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are those resulting from statutory requirements and those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined by the Secretary to be necessary for administering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this program effectively and efficiently, as discussed in those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections of the preamble that relate to specific sections of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Burdens specifically associated with information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection requirements, if any, are identified and explained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elsewhere in this preamble under the heading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In assessing the potential costs and benefits_both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitative and qualitative_of these proposed regulations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has determined that the benefits of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations justify the costs, and do not interfere with State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local, and tribal governments in the exercise of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governmental functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Department in complying with the specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of Executive Order 12866, the Secretary invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on whether there may be further opportunities to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any potential costs or increase potential benefits resulting from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these proposed regulations without impeding the effective and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient administration of the program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary certifies that these proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain reporting, recordkeeping, and compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are imposed on guaranty agencies, lenders, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schools by the regulations. These requirements, however, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have a significant impact because they would not impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excessive regulatory burdens or require unnecessary Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 682.208, 682.402, and 682.410 contain information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection requirements. As required by the Paperwork Reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1980, the Department of Education will submit a copy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these sections to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its review. (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations affect the following types of entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that participate in the FFEL Program: Guaranty agencies, lenders, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and schools. The Department needs and uses this information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly carry out its responsibility to administer certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspects of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annual public reporting burden for this collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is not expected to significantly increase. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection and reporting of the information in &sect;&sect;682.208 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
682.410 reflect normal business practice, whereas the closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school cancellation provision of &sect;682.402 essentially substitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a closed school claim for a default claim that normally would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have occurred if the student did not repay a loan made for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Rules governing the payment of claims based on filing for relief in bankruptcy, and cancellation of loans due to
death, total and permanent disability, attendance at a school that closes, and false certification by a school of
a borrower's eligibility for a loan, are set forth in this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If a PLUS loan was obtained by two parents as co-makers, or a Consolidation loan was obtained by a married couple,
and only one of the borrowers dies, becomes totally and permanently disabled, has collection of his or her loan obligation
stayed by a bankruptcy filing, or has that obligation discharged in bankruptcy, the other borrower remains obligated
to repay the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A loan qualifies for payment under this section only to the extent that the loan is legally enforceable under applicable
law by the holder of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For purposes of this section_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The legal enforceability of a loan is conclusively determined on the basis of a ruling by a court or administrative
tribunal of competent jurisdiction with respect to that loan, or a ruling with respect to another loan in a judgment
that collaterally estops the holder from contesting the enforceability of the loan;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) A loan is conclusively determined to be legally unenforceable to the extent that the guarantor determines, pursuant
to an objection presented in a proceeding prior to credit bureau reporting, tax refund offset, wage garnishment,
or other administrative proceeding, that the loan is not legally enforceable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If an objection has been raised by the borrower or another party about the legal enforceability of the loan and
no determination has been made under paragraph (a)(4) (i) or (ii) of this section, the Secretary may authorize the
payment of a claim under this section under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate. If the Secretary determines
in that or any other case that a claim was paid under this section with respect to a loan that was not a legally enforceable
obligation of the borrower, the recipient of that payment must refund that amount of the payment to the Secretary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Death.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If an individual borrower dies, or the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan dies, the obligation of the
borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is canceled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In determining that a borrower (or student) has died, the lender may rely on a death certificate or other proof of
death that is acceptable under applicable state law. If a death certificate or other acceptable proof of death is not
available, the borrower's obligation on the loan can be canceled only if the guaranty agency determines that other
evidence establishes that the borrower (or student) has died. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After receiving information indicating that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender, if it believes the
information to be reliable, shall suspend any collection activity against the borrower and promptly request that
the borrower's representative (or the student's parent in the case of a PLUS loan) provide the documentation described
in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. During the suspension of collection activity, which may not exceed 60 days, the
lender shall diligently attempt to obtain documentation verifying the borrower's (or student's) death. If, despite
diligent attempts, the lender is not able to confirm the borrower's (or student's) death within 60 days, the lender
shall resume collection activity from the point that it had been discontinued and is deemed to have exercised forbearance
as to repayment of the loan during the period when collection activity was suspended. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Once the lender has determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section that the borrower (or student) has died,
the lender may not attempt to collect on the loan from the borrower's estate or from any endorser. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The lender shall return to the sender any payments received from the estate or paid on behalf of the borrower after
the date of the borrower's (or student's) death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Total and permanent disability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) If the lender determines that an individual borrower is totally and permanently disabled, the obligation of the
borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is canceled. A borrower is not considered totally
and permanently disabled on the basis of a condition that existed at the time he or she applied for the loan, unless the
borrower's condition has substantially deteriorated later, so as to render the borrower totally and permanently
disabled. In the case of a Consolidation loan, the borrower must certify that the condition did not exist prior to the
time the borrower applied for each of the underlying loans, unless the condition has substantially deteriorated,
so as to render the borrower totally and permanently disabled. If the condition existed prior to the date the Consolidation
loan was made, the borrower must provide the lender with the disbursement dates of the underlying loans.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(A) A guaranty agency shall notify the Secretary immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whenever it becomes aware of reliable information indicating a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating school may have closed. The designated agency in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the state in which the school is located shall promptly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigate whether the school has closed, and whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
teach-out of the closed school's program was made available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students, and report the results of its investigation to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary no later than 30 days after receiving the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If a guaranty agency determines (or is informed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary) that a participating school has closed, it shall, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 30 days of making that determination or being informed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary, notify all lenders participating in its program to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspend collection efforts against individuals with respect to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loans made for attendance at the closed school, if the student to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whom (or on whose behalf) a loan was made was enrolled at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
school on the closing date or withdrew not more than 90 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to the date the school closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Within 30 days after receiving notice from the Secretary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a school has closed, a guaranty agency shall review its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records of loans that it holds and identify all borrowers (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
students) who appear to have been enrolled at the closed school 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the closing date or who withdrew not more than 90 days prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the date the school closed. If the guaranty agency knows the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's address, it shall, within 30 days after identifying a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower under paragraph (d) of this section, mail a discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application and an explanation of the information that must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the sworn statement (which may be combined) to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower. The application shall inform the borrower of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures and eligibility criteria for obtaining a discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) of this section does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify for a discharge, the agency shall notify the borrower in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
writing of that determination and the reasons for it within 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days after receiving the borrower's completed application and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sworn statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) A borrower's request for discharge may not be denied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely on the basis of failing to meet any time limits set by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lender, guaranty agency, or the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Lender responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) If the lender is notified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a guaranty agency or the Secretary, or receives information it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes to be reliable from another source indicating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower may be eligible for a loan cancellation under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) of this section, the lender shall immediately suspend any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan received for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program of study for which the loan was made (but may continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive borrower payments), and, within 30 days of receiving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information or notification, inform the borrower of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures for requesting a discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sworn statement described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 60 days of being notified of that option, the lender shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resume collection and shall be deemed to have exercised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forbearance of payment of principal and interest from the date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lender suspended collection activity. The lender may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capitalize, in accordance with 682.202(b), any interest accrued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and not paid during that period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The lender shall file a closed school claim with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency in accordance with &sect;682.402(g) no later than 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days after the lender receives the borrower's written request and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sworn statement described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a lender receives a payment made by or on behalf of the borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the loan after the lender files a claim on the loan with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency, the lender shall forward the payment to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency within 30 days of its receipt. The lender shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assist the guaranty agency and the borrower in determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the borrower is eligible for discharge of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Within 30 days after receiving reimbursement from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency for a closed school claim, the lender shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notify the borrower that the loan obligation has been discharged, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and request that all credit bureaus to which it previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported the status of the loan delete all adverse credit history 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assigned to the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary reimburses the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the loan in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, if the borrower's (or the student for whom a parent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received a PLUS loan) eligibility to receive the loan was falsely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified by an eligible school. For purposes of a false 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification discharge, the term ``borrower'' includes all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endorsers on a loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under paragraph (e) of this section relieves the borrower of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing obligation to repay the loan and any charges imposed or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs incurred by the holder with respect to the loan that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower is otherwise obligated to pay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voluntarily or through enforced collection on a loan obligation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharged under paragraph (e) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) A borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under paragraph (e) of this section is not regarded as in default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the loan after discharge, and is eligible to receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance under the Title IV, HEA programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section is reported by the loan holder to all credit reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to which the holder previously reported the status of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the loan, so as to delete all adverse credit history assigned to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the loan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

60 days after the lender receives the borrower's written request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and sworn statement described in paragraph (e)(3) of this

payment to the guaranty agency within 30 days of its receipt. The

discharge has been denied, the lender shall resume collection and

notify the borrower of the reasons for the denial. The lender

shall be deemed to have exercised forbearance of payment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principal and interest from the date the lender suspended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection activity, and may capitalize, in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pay the borrower an amount equal to the amount paid on the loan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by or on behalf of the borrower, less any school tuition refunds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or payments received by the holder, guaranty agency, or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

or other third-party with respect to a loan on which the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or the borrower's representative, any payment on a discharged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loan made by the borrower (or representative) and received after

the Secretary pays a closed school or false certification claim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time that the agency returns the payment, it shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notify the borrower (or representative) that there is no

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(or representative) continues to send payments to the guaranty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency, the agency shall remit all of those payments to the

 (i) Unless it initiates procedures to garnish the borrower's wages in accordance with paragraph (b)(10) of this section,
a guaranty agency shall attempt annual IRS offset on all eligible loans and engage in at least the collection activities
described in paragraphs (b)(6) (iii) through (xii) of this section on a loan on which it pays a default claim filed by
a lender, except that the agency may engage in the collection activities described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section
in lieu of the activities described in paragraphs (b)(6) (iii) through (vi) of this section. If, after initiating
wage garnishment procedures, the agency terminates those procedures for a particular borrower, the agency shall,
within 30 days, commence collection efforts at least as forceful as those described in paragraphs (b)(6) (iii) through
(xii) of this section. The agency's collection efforts shall begin with the same collection activities as those that
immediately preceded the initiation of garnishment procedures, or, if no collection activities had been performed,
the agency shall begin with the activities described in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section, except that the agency
may engage in the collection activities described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section in lieu of the activities described
in paragraphs (b)(6) (iii) through (vi) of this section.

(B) Send at least three written notices to the borrower forcefully demanding that the borrower immediately commence
repayment of the loan, and informing the borrower that the default has been reported to all national credit bureaus
(if that is the case) and that the borrower's credit rating may thereby have been damaged. The final notice also must
indicate that it is the final notice the borrower will receive before the agency will take more forceful action, including
the initiation of procedures to garnish the borrower's wages or instituting a civil suit to compel repayment of the
amount that the borrower owes plus related collection costs.

prior to the 545th day and returned to the agency less than 180 days prior to the 545th day, the agency has 180 days from
the date it receives the returned loan to garnish the borrower's wages or institute a civil suit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Administrative Garnishment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) If a guaranty agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decides to garnish the disposable pay of a borrower who is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making payments on a loan held by the agency, on which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has paid a reinsurance claim, it shall do so in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the following procedures: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The employer shall deduct and pay to the agency from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's wages an amount that does not exceed 10 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's disposable pay for each pay period, or the amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted by 15 U.S.C. 1673, unless the borrower provides the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency with written consent to deduct a greater amount. For this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose, the term ``disposable pay'' means that part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's compensation from an employer remaining after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deduction of any amounts required by law to be withheld. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceedings, the guaranty agency shall mail to the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last known address, a written notice of the nature and amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the debt, the intention of the agency to initiate proceedings to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collect the debt through deductions from pay, and an explanation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the borrower's rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to enter into a written repayment agreement with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency under terms agreeable to the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for a hearing in accordance with paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(10)(i)(J) of this section concerning the existence or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the debt and, in the case of a borrower whose repayment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schedule is established other than by a written agreement under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(10)(i)(D) of this section, the terms of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repayment schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(F) The guaranty agency shall sue any employer (including a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower who is self-employed) for any amount that the employer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after receipt of the garnishment notice provided by the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(H) of this section, fails to withhold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from wages owed and payable to an employee under the employer's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal pay and disbursement cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(G) The guaranty agency may not garnish the wages of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower whom it knows has been involuntarily separated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment until the borrower has been reemployed continuously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for at least 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(H) Unless the guaranty agency receives information that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withholding order, it shall send a withholding order to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer within 20 days after the borrower fails to make a timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for a hearing, or, if a timely request for a hearing is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by the borrower, within 20 days after a final decision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made by the agency to proceed with garnishment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) The notice given to the employer under paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(10)(i)(H) of this section must contain only the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withholding order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(J) The guaranty agency shall provide a hearing, which, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the borrower's option, may be oral or written, if the borrower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submits a written request for a hearing on the existence or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of the debt or the terms of the repayment schedule. An 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oral hearing may, at the borrower's option, be conducted either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in-person or by telephone conference. All telephonic charges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be the responsibility of the guaranty agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(K) If the borrower's written request is received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency on or before the 15th day following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower's receipt of the notice described in paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(10)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency may not issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a withholding order until the borrower has been provided the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested hearing. The guaranty agency shall provide a hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the borrower in sufficient time to permit a decision, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the procedures that the agency may prescribe, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be rendered within 60 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(L) If the borrower's written request is received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranty agency after the 15th day following the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of the notice described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, the guaranty agency shall provide a hearing to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower in sufficient time that a decision, in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the procedures that the agency may prescribe, may be rendered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 60 days, but may not delay issuance of a withholding order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless the agency determines that the delay in filing the request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was caused by factors over which the borrower had no control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(M) A hearing may not be conducted by an individual under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the supervision or control of the head of the guaranty agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except that an agency may appoint an administrative law judge to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(N) The hearing official shall issue a final written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision at the earliest practicable date, but not later than 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days after the guaranty agency's receipt of the borrower's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(O) As specified in section 488A(a)(8) of the HEA, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
borrower may seek judicial relief, including punitive damages, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the employer discharges, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action against the borrower due to the issuance of a withholding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) References to ``the borrower'' in this paragraph include

The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement on a proposal to harvest 30&hyph;40 million board
feet of both merchantable and unmerchantable wood products from approximately 8,000 acres of National Forest System
lands on the east side of Lake Tahoe in Nevada. Dead and dying trees would be cut, and a green tree thinning component
is also proposed to improve forest health. Jeffrey pine beetle suppression comprises part of the project. The proposed
action also uses prescribed fire and analyzes post sale treatments, including watershed improvement projects.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action harvests dead, dying, and diseased trees, many of which are beetle-infested, over approximately
8,000 acres of an 11,000-acre study area. Green trees would be thinned from overstocked stands, over about 2,000 acres,
some of which overlap the salvage acreage, and some of which is separate. Some of the 30 to 40 million board feet removed
will be useful lumber; much of the timber removed will have no commercial value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Trees would be removed from gentle slopes by tractor skidding systems. Trees would be flown from steeper terrain by
helicopter. No new permanent roads would be constructed; however, construction of additional temporary access
roads and landing sites would be required, as well as reconstruction and restoration of existing historic roads.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed action includes treatments that will follow removal of the trees. This includes (but is not limited
to) site preparation, planting, treatment of slash generated by the project, obliteration of temporary and unneeded
roads, and restoration of landings. Monitoring how effectively the project prevents future beetle attacks is part
of ``post sale'' work. The use of prescribed fire will be analyzed, both as a post-harvest treatment and as a long-term
management tool. This alternative treats the most acres with prescribed fire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Heritage (historic archaeological) resources are dispersed throughout the study area. Most are the remains of 19th
century logging, and not all of them will be protected. In addition to mitigation negotiated with the Advisory Council
of Historic Preservation, a key component of the analysis is to seek and address enhancement opportunities for representative
heritage properties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Watershed restoration projects, road closures, and mistletoe reduction opportunities may also be included in the
proposed action if they are, in the language of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), ``connected'', ``cumulative''
in their effects with the removal of dead trees, or are ``ripe for decision''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is proposed because of current forest mortality stemming from historical activities. Beginning in the
1850's many of the 200&hyph;500 year old pine trees around Lake Tahoe were harvested in support of silver mining activities
of the Comstock Lode. Earlier, the forest and consisted of diverse species that resisted drought and insect attacks.
After logging slowed in the 1890's, the area began to revegetate naturally. But a new and different forest grew to replace
the old. In the absence of frequently recurring fires, dense thickets of moisture-loving fir trees replaced much
of the open pine forest that had been cut. The drought that began in 1987 weakened and killed those fir trees that had
sprouted after the massive Comstock cutting.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Forty years of fire suppression has dramatically increased the density of trees and the amount of dead wood, standing
or on the ground. Members of the public have expressed concern over the large numbers of dead trees the amount of forest
fuels now present. Many requests have been made for projects to remove timber to reduce safety hazards, fire danger,
and to improve visual quality. Such projects would reduce the ``fuel loading'' and could decrease the risk and severity
of a catastrophic fire. Additionally, thinning of overstocked stands can be an effective way to prevent future catastrophic
insect and disease outbreaks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental analysis provides the decisionmaker_the LTBMU Forest Supervisor with an evaluation of what will
happen if nothing is done, and what may result from the proposed action, and other alternatives Such disclosure will
allow a reasoned choice between management options. If an alternative other than No Action is preferable, then the
work has to proceed quickly. If actively infested trees are removed before the onset of summer when the beetles fly,
then fewer healthy trees may be attacked. On small scale, high value areas, such as the East Shore beaches, beetle suppression
work may reduce the number of large Jeffrey pines that die. Further, trees that are harvested quickly will have more
commercial value. The high cost of a predominantly helicopter operation could deter potential bidders as the soundness
of the trees declines. Consequently, project implementation is expected to begin during the summer or fall of 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over sixty agencies, organizations, and individuals were notified of this proposed project through the LTBMU NEPA
Status Report. A public meeting was held on October 5, 1993 as part of the scoping process. Some people also provided
written comments. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency staff was briefed about the project on November 10, 1993. The Nevada
State Historic Preservation Officer has also been briefed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Originally conceived and publicly scoped as a project whose environmental analysis would be documented in an environmental
assessment, it was determined in late December 1993 that its potential environmental effects warrant an Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS). Project activities will adversely affect heritage resources in a National Register-eligible
historic district.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the type of NEPA documentation has changed since the project's conception, the project itself has not changed.
Consequently, only minimal additional public scoping will occur. A public and agency briefing on the project, to
be announced in the Tahoe Daily Tribune and through letters sent to those parties who have expressed interest in the
East Shore Project, will be held on January 26, 1994, at the El Dorado County Library at 1000 Rufus Allen Boulevard in
South Lake Tahoe. Participants in the planning process will be sent copies of the draft EIS for the public comment period.
Availability of the draft EIS will also be noticed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and the Tahoe Daily Tribune, the LTBMU's newspaper of record. Written comments and suggestions received by January
24, 1994 will be addressed in the draft EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``no action'' alternative proposes a continuation of the current types of management activities currently conducted
in the study areas, without imposing impacts from logging to heritage resources. Trees which pose hazards to life
and property will be taken down. While the long-term management of the Genoa Peak road system is primarily for off-highway
vehicle use, road reconstruction and maintenance at a logging truck standard along a portion of the road will be required
to accommodate log haul for timber sales on the adjacent Toiyabe National Forest, as analyzed in the Carson District's
Spooner Salvage Sale environmental assessment. Short-term road closures will prevent public recreation use of
parts of the area during timber sale operations. Obliteration of nonhistoric nonsystem roads, maintenance of existing
system roads and trails, watershed improvement projects, and study and management of the proposed National Register
District will continue as part of ongoing programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``salvage only'' alternative harvests dead, dying, and diseased trees, many of which are beetle-infested, over
approximately 6,600 acres. No green tree thinning will occur. Removal of about 30 MMBF of both merchantable and unmerchantable
material is anticipated. This alternative includes all components of the proposed action, except when modified
as described: (1) While treatment of activity fuels will occur, only limited use of prescribed fire as a management
tool is proposed, in selected areas, such as for use as a fuelbreak near urban areas; (2) site preparation and planting
will occur on high value areas only (such as at the beaches and along roadway corridors) and natural regeneration only
will occur in general forest zones; and (3) only temporary roads and landings used as part of the project will be obliterated.

The fourth alternative emphasizes helicopter harvesting in areas with significant heritage resources. It harvests
dead, dying, and diseased trees, many of which are beetle-infested, over approximately 6,750 acres_with approximately
550 acres less tractor logging than alternatives two or three. Green trees would be thinned from overstocked stands
only within those areas entered for salvage activities. Removal of 30 to 35 MMBF of both merchantable and unmerchantable
material is anticipated. This alternative includes all components of the proposed action, except when modified
as described: (1) While treatment of activity fuels will occur, only limited use of prescribed fire as a management
tool is proposed, in selected areas, such as for use as a fuelbreak near urban areas.

Implementation of this project requires a permit from the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA). It is in a classification
of actions requiring TRPA Governing Board review and approval. Additionally, encroachment permits from the Nevada
Department of Transportation are required for project implementation. Consultation with the Nevada State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) in accordance with the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is required. Concurrence from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is needed if the Forest Service Biological Assessment
results in a ``may affect'' determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision on this analysis, pursuant to NEPA, is made by Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit Forest Supervisor, Robert
Harris, as the Forest Service is the lead agency under NEPA. There is no other joint lead agency and no cooperating agencies
under NEPA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft EIS is anticipated to be filed with the Environmental Protection Agency and made available to the public
for comment in February of 1994. The final EIS and its Record of Decision is expected in May of 1994. The decision will
be appealable under Forest Service regulations found at 36 CFR part 215.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period for the draft EIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability
appears in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The public will also be informed of the availability of the DEIS by news releases issued to the media in the Lake Tahoe
region. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at that time. To be the most
helpful, comments on the draft EIS should be as specific as possible and may address the adequacy of the statement or
the merits of the alternatives discussed (see the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing
the procedural provisions of NEPA at 40 CFR 1503.3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of draft EIS' must structure their participation
in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewers' position
and contentions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On October 8, 1991, a federal court approved settlement between the State and Federal governments and Exxon under
which Exxon will pay $1 billion in criminal restitution and civil damages to the governments. The State and Federal
Trustees will receive $900 million in civil damages from Exxon over the 10 years. The funds are to be used to restore
to their pre-spill condition the natural resources and the services they provide, that were injured by the Exxon Valdez
oil spill. This includes the restoration of any natural resource injured, lost or destroyed and the services provided
by that resource or which replaces or substitutes for the injured, lost or destroyed resource and affected services.
Restoration includes all phases of injury assessment, restoration, replacement, and enhancement of natural resources,
and acquisition of equivalent resources and services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All decisions about restoration and uses of restoration funds are determined by six natural resources Trustees,
three Federal and three State. The three Federal Trustees are: The Administrator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Secretaries of the Department of Agriculture and of the Interior.
The three State Trustees are: The Commissioners of Fish and Game and Environmental Conservation, and the Attorney
General. A Trustee Council, located in Alaska, which is made up of designees of the Federal Trustees and the three State
Trustees, is responsible for decisions relating to the assessment of injuries, uses of the restoration funds, and
all restoration activities including the preparation of a Restoration Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 10, 1992 (57 FR 12473&hyph;12475) on behalf of the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, the Forest Service published
a Notice of Intent to prepare an EIS on the Restoration Plan. Since then the Trustee Council has developed a draft Restoration
Plan which has become the proposed action for the analysis to be conducted in the EIS.

B. Draft Restoration Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed action (Draft Restoration Plan) consists of nine policy statements, a discussion of categories of restoration
actions and broad objectives for injured resources. The policies for identifying and conducting restoration actions
are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The restoration program will take an ecosystem approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Restoration activities may be considered for any injured resource or service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Most restoration activities will occur within the spill area. However, restoration activities outside the spill
are, but within Alaska, may be considered when the most effective restoration actions for an injured migratory population
are in a part of its range outside the spill area or when the information acquired from research and monitoring activities
outside the spill area will be important for restoration or understanding injuries within the spill area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Restoration activities will emphasize resources and services that have not recovered. Resources and service
will be enhanced, as appropriate, to promote restoration. Restoration projects should not adversely affect the
ecosystem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Projects designed to restore or enhance an injured service must have a sufficient relationship to an injured resource;
must benefit the same user group that was injured; and, should be compatible with the character and public uses of the
area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Competitive proposals for restoration projects will be encouraged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Restoration projects will be subject to independent scientific review before Trustee Council approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Meaningful public participation in restoration decisions will be actively solicited.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Government agencies will be funded only for restoration work that they do not normally conduct.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Four types of restoration actions are identified and discussed in the Draft Restoration Plan: General restoration,
habitat protection and acquisition, monitoring and research, and public information and administration. Alternatives
to the proposed action will place different emphases on each of these categories of restoration actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Restoration consists of activities that fall within manipulation of the environment, management of human
use for reduction of marine pollution. Decisions about conducting general restoration projects would look at the
following factors: Extent of natural recovery, the value of an injured resource to the ecosystem and to the public,
the duration of benefits, the technical feasibility of the project, the likelihood of success, the relationship
of costs to expected benefits, potential for harmful side effects, benefits to more than one resource, effects on
health and human safety, consistency with applicable laws, and policies, and duplication with other actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Habitat Protection and Acquisition is a category that includes purchase of private land or interests in land such
as conservation easements, mineral rights, or timber rights. It also includes recommendations for changing public
agency management practices. Specific policies that relate to habitat protection and acquisition are proposed.
These policies deal with ranking potential lands to determine potential benefits, the need for a willing seller,
purchasing at fair market value, post acquisition management of the acquired lands and involving the public in the
prioritization process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring and Research consists of recovery monitoring, restoration monitoring and ecological monitoring and
research. Specific policies governing the selecting and performance of monitoring activities are discussed in
the Draft Restoration Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public Information and Administration is the last category of restoration actions. It consists of all necessary
administrative actions that are not attributable to a particular project. The Draft Restoration Plan goal for this
category is for administrative costs to average no more than 5 percent of overall restoration expenditures for the
remainder of the settlement period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General restoration objectives have been developed for resources that are recovering, resources not recovering,
resources where the recovery is unknown, resources such as archaeological resources and wilderness, and services.
These broad objectives will guide in the development of annual work plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further information regarding the proposed action and possible restoration alternatives is included in the Exxon
Valdez Oil Spill Restoration, Volume I: Restoration Framework, April, 1992; the Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration
Plan, Summary of Alternatives for Public Comment, April 1993; the Supplement to Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration
Plan, Summary of Alternatives for Public Comment, June 1993; the Summary of Public Comment on Alternatives of the
Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan, September 1993; and the Draft Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Restoration Plan,
November 1993. Copies of these documents may be required from the Oil Spill Public Information Office, 645 G. Street,
Anchorage, Alaska, 99501. Phone number 907 278&hyph;8008 or within Alaska 800 478&hyph;7745, outside Alaska 800

C. Scoping and Issue Development
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
With publication of this Revised Notice of Intent, the Trustees are continuing a process intended to identify those
issues that need to be addressed in preparing the Draft EIS (DEIS). Under the National Environmental Policy Act, this
process is called ``scoping.'' Two rounds of public meetings have been held within the spill area soliciting comments
on development of the Draft Restoration Plan. The results of the scoping to date have guided the preparation of the
Draft Restoration Plan. During the scoping process for development of the proposed action the Trustees obtained
information, comments, and assistance from Federal, State and local agencies, and other individuals or organizations
interested in, or affected by restoration. Several of the documents referenced above provide summaries of public
comments received to date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further scoping is being conducted to identify the issues to be addressed in the EIS and the range of alternatives that
will need to be developed and analyzed. In addition to publishing this Revised Notice of Intent, interested and affected
people within the spill area will be contacted through the news media. The Public Advisory Group will also be contacted
soliciting comments.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
D. Expected Time for Completion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
A DEIS should be filed with EPA by mid June 1994 and the final EIS should be filed in late October 1994. The Trustees will
consider the comments, responses, disclosure of environmental consequences, and applicable laws, regulations
and policies in making decisions regarding restoration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
E. Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The comment period on the DEIS will be 45 days from the date the Environmental Protection Agency's notice of availability
appears in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate at that time. To be most helpful, comments
on the DEIS statement should be as specific as possible, and may address the adequacy of the statement or the merits
of the alternatives discussed. (See the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural
provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Federal court decisions have established that reviewers of DEIS statements must structure their participation
in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position
and concerns.

The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to analyze and disclose the environmental
impacts of a proposal to harvest timber and construct and reconstruct roads in the Zulu and Can Creek and South Fork
of the Yaak River drainages located about 18 air miles northeast of Troy, Montana. This EIS will tier to the Kootenai
National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan and EIS, which provide overall guidance for achieving the desired
forest condition of the area. The purpose of the proposed action is to harvest dead, dying or high risk (to mountain
pine beetle infestation) stands of lodgepole pine to reduce potential excessive future natural fuel loadings, increase
the health and productivity of stands that are currently declining in vigor and provide a more balanced distribution
of timber age classes in the Project Area.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The timber management activities under consideration would occur within a 13,234 acre analysis area which includes
8,000 acres of Inventoried Roadless Area X166, Pink Mountain (6,400 acres), and portion of 684, Roderick (approximately
1,600 acres).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would harvest about 7.2 million board feet from 15 harvest units totalling 706 acres. Approximately
six miles of new specified road would be constructed and 2 miles of existing road would be reconstructed. Approximately
1.5 miles of temporary road would be required and approximately .6 miles of constructed skid trail. With this proposed
action, a portion of the roadless areas may be affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a variety of purposes for timber harvest and reforestation in the South Fork Yaak area; the primary purposes
are: (1) To improve timber productivity by replacing stands of dead dying or high risk lodgepole pine with younger,
more vigorously growing trees; (2) to salvage the dead and lodgepole pine; (3) to reduce potentially future catastrophic
wildfire conditions by removal of natural dead or dying fuels; and (4) to increase the overall health and vigor of other
stands being considered for management. Additionally, the purpose of road construction and reconstruction is to
facilitate access to the timber stands to be harvested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project area consists of approximately 13,234 acres located in Sections 2&hyph;11, 4&hyph;22, 28&hyph;30,
T34N, R31W; Sections 1, 12, 13, 24, 25, T34N, R32W; Sections 29&hyph;34, T35N, R31W; and Section 36, T35N, R32W; P.M.M.,
Lincoln County, Montana.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to be made is what, if anything, should be done in the South Fork Yaak River Project Area to: (a) Increase
timber health and productivity and contribute to the Forest's sustained yield of timber products, (b) reduce natural
fuel loadings of dead and dying lodgepole pine as a result of past and potential mountain pine beetle infestations,
(c) dispose of slash and reforest harvested lands, (d) develop and manage the road system to facilitate removal of
timber, reforest stands and maintain or improve wildlife security and (e) create a situation of better age class distributions
of stands within project area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Kootenai Forest Plan provides guidance for management activities within the potentially affected area through
its goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, and management area direction. The areas of proposed timber harvest
and reforestation would occur within Management Areas 12, 15, 17 and 14. Timber harvest would occur only on suitable
timber land. Road construction and reconstruction would occur in these four management areas. Below is a brief description
of the applicable management direction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Area 12_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest, provided
that big game summer habitat objectives are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Area 14_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest, provided
that grizzly bear habitat objectives are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Area 15_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Area 17_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest, viewing
objectives are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service will consider a range of alternatives. One of these will be the ``no action'' alternative, in which
none of the proposed activities will be implemented. Additional alternatives will examine varying levels and locations
for the proposed activities to achieve the proposal's purposes, as well as to respond to the issues and other resource
values.

mitigation measures and their effectiveness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public participation is an important part of the analysis, commencing with the initial scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7)
which has already occurred in December of 1991. In addition, the public is encouraged to visit with Forest Service
officials at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. The Forest Service will be seeking information,
comments, and assistance from Federal, State and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be

Preliminary scoping, including public and agency participation, was initiated in December, 1991, and has continued
through this year. Until recently, an Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)
were envisioned. However, it became apparent to the Interdisciplinary Team that there could be significant effects
on the human environment in Roadless Areas X166 and 684.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal environmental issues identified to date are related to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Impacts on the character of the area of Roadless Area 684 and X166.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Impacts on fish habitat and other beneficial uses due to potential sediment increase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Impacts on big game security and habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Fuels accumulations in terms of potential catastrophic wildfire situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other issues commonly associated with timber harvesting and road construction include: effects on water quality,
cultural resources, soils, old growth, and visuals. This list may be verified, expanded, or modified based on public
scoping for this proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been initiated with regard to listed species. The Montana
Department of Health and Welfare-Division of Environmental Quality, Montana Department of Fish and Game, and the
Kootenai Salish Indian Tribe will also be consulted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While public participation in this analysis is welcome at any time, comments received within 45 days of the publication
of this notice will be especially useful in the preparation of the draft EIS, which is expected to be filed with the EPA
and available for public review in March, 1994. A 45-day comment period will follow publication of a Notice of Availability
of the draft EIS in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service believes it is important at this early stage to give reviewers notice of several court rulings related
to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of draft EISs must structure their
participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful and alerts an agency to the reviewer's
position and contentions

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Forest Service will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) to analyze and disclose the environmental
impacts of a proposal to harvest timber and construct and reconstruct roads in the East and West Fork of Basin Creek
located about 29 air miles northeast of Troy, Montana. This EIS will tier to the Kootenai National Forest Land and Resource
Management Plan and EIS, which provide overall guidance for achieving the desired forest condition of the area. The
purpose of the proposed action is to help reduce existing natural fuel loadings of standing and down dead lodgepole
pine, increase the productivity on those suitable areas that sites currently are not growing anywhere near full potential
and increase the health and vigor of proposed salvage stands which will help maintain a more equal distribution of
timber age classes.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The timber salvage management activities under consideration would occur within a 6,046 acre analysis area which
is immediately adjacent to the East and West Fork of Basin Creek.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would harvest about 17.6 million board feet from 10 harvest units totaling 1,258 acres. Approximately
4 miles of new road would be constructed and 3 miles of existing road would be reconstructed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a variety of purposes for timber harvest and reforestation in the Basin Creek area; the primary purposes
are: (1) To improve timber productivity by replacing stands of dead, down or dying lodgepole pine with younger, more
vigorously growing trees; (2) to salvage the dead, down and dying lodgepole pine; and (3) to reduce potentially catastrophic
wildfire conditions by removal of natural dead, down or dying fuels. Additionally, the purpose of road construction
and reconstruction is to facilitate access to the timber stands to be harvested. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project area consists of approximately 6,046 acres located in Sections 20&hyph;22, 26&hyph;29, and 32&hyph;34,
T36N, R30N, P.M.M., Lincoln County, Montana. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The decision to be made is what, if anything, should be done in the Basin Creek Project Area to: (a) Increase timber productivity
and contribute to the Forest's sustained yield of timber products through salvage operations, (b) reduce natural
fuel loadings of dead, down and dying lodgepole pine as a result of past mountain pine beetle infestations, (c) dispose
of slash and reforest harvested lands, (d) develop and manage the road system to facilitate removal of timber, reforest
stands and maintain or improve wildlife and (e) create a situation of better age class distributions of stands within
project area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Kootenai Forest Plan provides guidance for management activities within the potentially affected area through
its goals, objectives, standards and guidelines, and management area direction. The areas of proposed timber harvest
and reforestation would occur within Management Areas 12 and 14. Timber harvest would occur only on suitable timber
land. Road construction and reconstruction would occur in these two management areas plus Management Area 13 when
crossing the East Fork of Basin Creek. Below is a brief description of the applicable management direction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Area 12_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest, provided
that big game summer habitat objectives are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Area 13_These are areas that contain special habitat characteristics which are suitable for old-growth
dependent wildlife. Local road construction is permitted, providing that they are restricted following use to protect
snag characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Area 14_These are areas that contain productive timber lands which are suitable for timber harvest, provided
that grizzly bear habitat objectives are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Forest Service will consider a range of alternatives. One of these will be the ``no action'' alternative, in which
none of the proposed activities will be implemented. Additional alternatives will examine varying levels and locations
for the proposed activities to achieve the proposal's purposes, as well as to respond to the issues and other resource
values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will analyze the direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the alternatives. Past, present,
and projected activities on National Forest Lands will be considered. The EIS will disclose the analysis of site-specific
mitigation measures and their effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public participation is an important part of the analysis, commencing with the initial scoping process (40 CFR 1501.7)
which has already occurred in March of 1992. In addition, public is encouraged to visit with Forest Service officials
at any time during the analysis and prior to the decision. The Forest Service will be seeking information, comments,
and assistance from Federal, State and local agencies and other individuals or organizations who may be interested
in or affected by the proposed action. No public meetings are scheduled at this time. Comments from the public and other
agencies will be used in preparation of the Draft EIS. The scoping process will be used to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Identify potential issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Identify major issues to by analyzed in depth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Eliminates minor issues or those which have been covered by a relevant previous environmental analysis, such as
the Kootenai Forest Plan EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Identify alternatives to the proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Identify potential environmental effects of the proposed action and alternatives (i.e. direct, indirect, and
cumulative effects). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Determine potential cooperating agencies and task assignments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preliminary scoping, including public and agency participation, was initiated in March, 1992, and has continued
through this year. Until recently, an Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI)
were envisioned. However, it became apparent to the Interdisciplinary Team that due to the size and scope of the proposed
action, that effects on the biological characteristics of the area could be considered significant. In such cases,
an EIS is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal environmental issues identified to date are related to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Wildlife habitat and security maintenance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Fuels treatment and accumulations in terms of potential catastrophic wildfire situations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The environmental assessment of this federally assisted action indicates that the project will not cause significant
local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, L. Pete Heard, State Conservationist,
has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement are not needed for this project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project purposes are to reduce damage to agricultural land and public utilities, reduce downstream damages due
to sedimentation, reduce land loss from channel instability and to reduce flooding of crop fields. The planned works
of improvement include one hundred sixteen minor grade control (pipe) structures, eight road culvert stabilization
(rock) sites, five major grade control structures, ten thousand linear feet of stream bank stabilization, approximately
4.7 miles of channel restoration and accelerated technical assistance for land treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency
and to various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are
available to fill single copy requests at the above address. Basic data developed during the environmental assessment
are on file and may be reviewed by contacting L. Pete Heard.

Martin Brothers International, Respondent; Order Modifying Administrative Appeal Decision and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 30, 1993, I entered an Administrative Appeal Decision and Order in the above-captioned matter imposing
a civil penalty of $75,000 on Martin Brothers International and denying Martin Brothers International's export
privileges for one year, with the last 10 months suspended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through inadvertence, that Order failed to state the date upon which the civil penalty is due. To correct that oversight,
I hereby order that the $75,000 civil penalty imposed in the November 30, 1993 Administrative Appeal Decision and
Order in the above-captioned matter is due and shall be paid in its entirety, in accordance with the attached instructions,
within 30 days of the date of this Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, that Order failed to list the countries in the Middle East to which Martin Brothers International is denied
export privileges for one year, with the last 10 months suspended. To correct that oversight, I hereby order that the
September 9, 1992 Supplement to Decision and Order issued by the Administrative Law Judge is modified by adding the
following sentence at the end of Part II. thereof:

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Executive Order 11625 and 15 U.S.C. 1512, the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is soliciting
competitive applications under its Minority Business Development Center (MBDC) Program. The total cost of performance
for the first budget period (12 months) from May 1, 1994 to April 30, 1995, is estimated at $198,971. The application
must include a minimum cost-share of 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. Cost-sharing
contributions may be in the form of cash contributions, clients fees, in-kind contributions or combinations thereof.
The MBDC will operate in the Las Vegas, Nevada Geographic Service Area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The funding instrument for this project will be a cooperative agreement. Competition is open to individuals, non-profit
and for-profit organizations, state and local governments, American Indian tribes and educational institutions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MBDC program provides business development services to the minority business community to help establish and
maintain viable minority businesses. To this end, MBDA funds organizations to identify and coordinate public and
private sector resources on behalf of minority individuals and firms; to offer a full range of management and technical
assistance to minority entrepreneurs; and to serve as a conduit of information and assistance regarding minority
business.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria: The experience and capabilities of the firm and its staff
in addressing the needs of the business community in general and specifically, the special needs of minority businesses,
individuals and organizations (50 points); the resources available to the firm in providing business development
services (10 points); the firm's approach (techniques and methodologies) to performing the work requirements included
in the application (20 points); and the firm's estimated cost for providing such assistance (20 points). An application
must receive at least 70% of the points assigned to each evaluation criteria category to be considered programmatically
acceptable and responsive. Those applications determined to be acceptable and responsive will then be evaluated
by the Director of MBDA. Final award selections shall be based on the number or points received, the demonstrated responsibility
of the applicant, and the determination of those most likely to further the purpose of the MBDA program. Negative audit
findings and recommendations and unsatisfactory performance under prior Federal awards may result in an application
not being considered for award. The applicant with the highest point score will not necessarily receive the award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MBDCs shall be required to contribute at least 15% of the total project cost through non-Federal contributions. To
assist in this effort, the MBDCs may charge client fees for management and technical assistance (M&amp;TA) rendered.
Based on a standard rate of $50 per hour, the MBDC will charge client fees at 20% of the total cost for firms with gross
sales of $500,000 or less, and 35% of the total cost for firms with gross sales of over $500,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quarterly reviews culminating in year-to-date evaluations will be conducted to determine if funding for the project
should continue. Continued funding will be at the total discretion of MBDA based on such factors as an MBDC's performance,
the availability of funds and Agency priorities.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 22, November 19, and November 29, 1993, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely
Disabled published notices (58 FR 54559, 61072 and 62646) of proposed additions to the Procurement List.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide
the commodities and service, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors,
the Committee has determined that the commodities and service listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal
Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
51&hyph;2.4.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
major factors considered for this certification were:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small
entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities and service to the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and service to the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day
Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and service proposed for addition to the Procurement
List.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The New York Cotton Exchange (NYCE or Exchange) has applied for designation as a contract market in currency cross-rate
futures and futures option contracts based on each of the following five currency crosses: French franc/Deutsche
mark; Swedish krona/Deutsche mark; Italian lira/Deutsche mark; Japanese yen/Deutsche mark; and Deutsche mark/British
pound. The Acting Director of the Division of Economic Analysis (Division) of the Commission, acting pursuant to
the authority delegated by Commission Regulation 140.96, has determined that publication of the proposals for comment
is in the public interest, will assist the Commission in considering the views of interested persons, and is consistent
with the purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is to mine construction-grade aggregate deposits from a seventeen-mile stretch of the Santa
Maria and Sisquoc Rivers, both waters of the United States. The California Division of Mines and Geology has determined
that the most significant concentration of construction-grade aggregate in the region occurs in and just adjacent
to the rivers. This deposit contains material that is important to two counties for the construction, maintenance
and rehabilitation of public and private facilities. The proposed action is intended to help satisfy the long-term
demand for commercially-useable aggregate material in the region.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the action will require a permit under section 404 of the Clean Water Act (as amended) and adverse impacts to
the aquatic ecosystem may result, the Corps has determined that the proposed action warrants an Environmental Impact
Statement (EIS) pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Joint Review Panel (JRP) consisting of the primary permitting agencies for the project has been formed to coordinate
multi-agency review. The JRP includes representatives of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, California Division
of Mines and Geology, County of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo will serve as co-lead agencies under the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The environmental document will therefore be circulated as a joint Environmental
Impact Statement/Environmental Impact Report (EIS/EIR).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Coast Rock Products, Inc. (Coast Rock), has applied to the Corps of Engineers for a section 404 individual permit to
remove sand and gravel material from a seventeen-mile stretch of the Santa Maria and Sisquoc Rivers over the course
of the next 25 years. In 1989, the California Division of Mines and Geology (CDMG) reported that currently permitted
sources of construction-grade aggregate (classified as MRZ&hyph;2 by CDMG) are theoretically sufficient to supply
only 65 percent of the projected aggregate demand in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties (the service area)
over the next 50 years. CDMG further found that the largest concentration of construction-grade material in the service
area extends along these rivers from a narrow canyon in the Sisquoc Ranch to the ancient floodplain underlying the
City of Santa Maria. Because much of this material is no longer accessible due to surface improvements or established
land use, the most viable long-term sources have been identified to occur within and adjacent to the rivers. Thus,
the overall purpose of the proposed action is to mine high-quality, construction-grade aggregate (MRZ&hyph;2 classified)
deposits from within the service area for the long-term utilization of the resource (at least the next 25 years) and
reclaim mined lands in accordance with the requirements of the California State Surface Mining and Reclamation Act
(SMARA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to mining sand and gravel, Coast Rock proposes several secondary objectives to the overall project purpose.
These include providing flood protection, enhancing groundwater recharge, reclaiming farm land lost to erosion
and past mining, and establishing wildlife habitat.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
2. Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
At least the following alternatives will be considered: (1) No action; (2) applicant's preferred project; (3) off-site
(outside the 100-year floodplain) mining; (4) mining in the river (within the 100-year floodplain) but not within
section 404 jurisdiction; (5) a reduced-scale project; and (6) alternative landuse/reclamation scenarios.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This announces the availability of the Record of Decision (ROD) regarding the relocation of the Army's electromagnetic
pulse (EMP) simulators currently located at the Woodbridge Research Facility (WRF), in Woodbridge, Virginia, to
a new location selected from six candidate relocation sites evaluated for the facility. The Army has decided to relocate
its four existing simulators, construct a new simulator, the Vertical EMP Simulator-Second Generation (VEMPS II),
and operate the new facility at the Orogrande Site at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 27, 1989, the Army announced a proposal to relocate the WRF EMP simulators to a new site, citing the following
reasons: The need to continue simulated EMP testing in accordance with Army requirements, the desire to use the economics
of collocation of test operations, and the concern to adjust to the rapidly expanding population in the Woodbridge
and Northern Virginia areas. In 1991, after the Army announced its proposal to relocate the WRF EMP simulators, the
WRF was designated for closure in accordance with the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;510).
The Army is planning to close the WRF in September 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As presented in the Final EIS, the Department of the Army's proposed action is to relocate its existing electromagnetic
pulse (EMP) simulators from the Woodbridge Research Facility, Woodbridge, Virginia, construct a new simulator,
the Vertical EMP Simulator II (VEMPS II), and operate them at a site selected from six candidate sites at Army installations
in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. This action entails the dismantling of the existing EMP simulators at the WRF, transporting
the equipment to the selected new site, preparation of the site facilities at the new location and the construction
and operation of the EMP simulators at the new site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council on Environmental Quality regulations (40 CFR 1505.2) for implementing the provisions of the National Environmental
Policy Act direct the preparation of a public Record of Decision concerning decisions reached on actions considered
in Environmental Impact Statements. The relocation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
WRF EMP simulators to a new location and its potential impacts have been discussed in the final environmental documents
filed with the Environmental Protection Agency, as announced on November 26, 1993 (58 FR, No. 226; p. 62345).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ROD identifies the Orogrande Site as the site for construction of the new facility and summarizes the alternatives
considered, the basis for selection of this site, and measures that will be undertaken to minimize environmental
effects. This site was both the Army's preferred site and the environmentally preferred site because Orogrande is
the location of the U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command Nuclear Effects Directorate, and essentially all Army scientists
and engineers who perform EMP testing are located in this area, thus simplifying logistics for operating the site.
Further, the availability of these technologists and easily accessible operations and maintenance support from
the main post area at WSMR simplifies test support logistics, thereby, minimizing the costs and time required to complete
tests. Additionally, laboratory and administrative space is available at the existing Nuclear Effects Directorate
offices, thereby minimizing the dollar investment to construct the site. The utilization of these spaces also eliminates
the ground disturbance and loss of biological habitat and archeological resources associated with constructing
the administrative staging areas and buildings, the need to construct four miles of security fencing and perimeter
roadways, thus reducing cost and additional loss of biological habitat and archeological resources, and the impact
to biological species. Also the roadways and test areas of the EMP facilities can be sited to avoid archeological resources
and their operation at the Orogrande Site will have the least impact on the operations and facilities at WSMR.

The Commission has received 438 rate filings, made under section 205 of the Federal Power Act, during the period December
22, 1993 through January 3, 1994. Many of the filings reflect the submission of multiple agreements for Commission
review. Most of the filings have been made to take advantage of a general amnesty period, announced on July 30, 1993,
for the filing of agreements under which jurisdictional service was being provided as of that date under previously-unfiled
rates, terms and conditions. See Prior Notice and Filing Requirements Under Part II of the Federal Power Act, 64 FERC
&para;&blank;61,139, reh'g denied, 65 FERC &para;&blank;61,081 (1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attachment A to this notice lists all of these rate filings in chronological and numerical order, starting with filings
made on December 22, 1993. Attachment B to this notice lists all of these filings in alphabetical order, by applicant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the extremely large number of rate filings made during the period December 22, 1993 through January 3, 1994,
the Commission is unable to issue individual notices of filing for each of the filings made during this period. In order
to ensure issuance of notice of filings at the earliest possible date, and to allow sufficient time for review and response,
the Commission hereby issues this single notice for all of the filings listed in the Attachments.

 Any person desiring to inspect a copy of any of the filings may do so during normal business hours in the Commission's
public reference room, room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. (Of course, customers to the
filed agreements and, in many cases, affected state commissions already have actual notice of the contents of the
filings by virtue of the Commission's regulations, see 18 CFR 35.2(d)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to protest any of the enumerated filings should file a motion to intervene or protest
with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC. 20426, in accordance
with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.211, 385.214. Protests will
be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants
parties to any of the proceedings. Any person desiring to become a party must file a motion to intervene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Motions or protests in response to filings made from December 22, 1993 through December 27, 1993, as indicated in the

been collected. Since the proceeding in Docket No. FA88&hyph;62&hyph;000 involves various interrelated issues
concerning the Company's recovery of reclamation costs through the wholesale fuel clause, the Company also requests
the Commission to defer any action on this filing until all issues in that docket are before it.

Take notice that on December 17, 1993, Florida Power Corporation requested the Commission to withdraw its filing
made on October 15, 1993 in the above named docket. That filing contained provisions concerning displacement energy
purchased by Seminole Electric Cooperative, Inc. Since the same provisions are contained in a settlement agreement
filed on December 17, 1993, in Docket No. ER93&hyph;299&hyph;000, and since those provisions constitute an integral
part of the settlement, Florida Power states that those provisions should be reviewed as part of the settlement rather
than in this docket.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a new license for the existing Byllesby-Buck Hydroelectric Project, located on the New River
in Carroll County, Virginia, near the city of Galax, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA). In the
DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project
and has concluded that licensing the project, with appropriate environmental protection, mitigation, and enhancement
measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment.

Description of Amendment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
State of California, Department of Water Resources, applied for an amendment of license to construct a new tunnel
intake structure replacing an existing intake structure. The construction is necessary because the existing intake
structure does not meet current seismic design standards and there would be an unacceptably long interruption in
water deliveries if the intake structure be upgraded. The new intake structure will be constructed behind an earth
plug, with the Silverwood Lake level lowered to elevation 3310 feet during construction. Upon completion of construction,
the lake water level will be lowered to elevation of 3260 feet for removing the earth plug. The normal water elevation
of the Silverwood Lake is 3320 feet.

Description of proposed amendment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nebraska Public Power District, licensee for the North Platte/Keystone Diversion Dam Project, filed an application
to amend article 401 of their license. Article 401 requires the licensee to develop and maintain eight islands as nesting
habitat for interior least terns and piping plovers. The proposed amendment would allow the licensee to substitute
up to four sand pits for four of the eight islands they are required to develop. The proposed amendment requires a plan
on how these sand pits would be developed. A draft plan was included in the licensee's filing.

Equitrans inadvertently proposed to a install a sales tap in the City of Monongahela Township, Washington County,
Pennsylvania, to provide gas service to Equitable Gas Company, a division of Equitable Resources, Inc. (Equitable).
Equitrans converted its sales entitlements on September 1, 1993, to transportation in accordance with Order No.
636. As such, the proposed tap should be classified as a delivery tap supporting transportation deliveries to Equitable.
Equitrans would deliver up to one Mcf of natural gas on a peak day under its FERC Rate Schedule FTS. Equitrans states
that installation of the proposed delivery tap would permit Equitable to provide gas service to Albert M. and Shirle
Gallick of Marianna, Pennsylvania. Equitrans also states that its tariff does not prohibit this type of service.

Take notice that on December 22, 1993, NUI Corporation (NUI), 550 Route 202&hyph;206, P.O. Box 760, and Pennsylvania
&amp; Southern Gas Company (PSGC), 102 Desmond Street, Sayre, Pennsylvania 18840, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;156&hyph;000
a joint application requesting a certificate pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) permitting NUI

for PSGC regarding the same facilities, and a service area determination for NUI pursuant to Section 7(f) of the NGA,
all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUI proposes to merge with PSGC and acquire certain minor natural gas facilities in New York and Pennsylvania used
by PSGC to transport gas in interstate commerce in conjunction with PSGC's local distribution activities. It is stated
that in order to operate the facilities acquired from PSGC, NUI requests a declaration that it qualifies as a local
distribution company in the service area to be determined for purposes of Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act
(NGPA). NUI also requests a waiver of the regulatory requirements ordinarily applicable to a natural gas company
under the NGA and the NGPA.

Take notice that on December 21, 1993, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company (Panhandle), P.O. Box 1642, Houston, Texas
77001, filed an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for authority to abandon by transfer to
its subsidiary, Panhandle Field Services Company (Field Services), gathering systems located on its West End System
in the states of Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file
with the Commission and open to public inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panhandle states that, as a result of its compliance with Order No. 636 and the required unbundling of its transportation
and gathering rates together with its customers' elections to cease purchasing natural gas from Panhandle, the utilization
of Panhandle's gathering facilities has declined and is expected to continue to decline. It also indicated that Order
No. 636 has intensified the competition for gathering services in the Anadarko Basin Area where the bulk of Panhandle's
facilities are located. It is alleged that because of its status as a ``natural gas company'' under the provisions
of the Natural Gas Act, Panhandle cannot compete with gatherers that are not subject to the Commission's jurisdiction.
Panhandle proposes to transfer its gathering facilities to Field Services which would not be subject to the Commission's
jurisdiction. Panhandle then contends that Field Services could then compete as a gatherer on a more level playing
field with the competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panhandle states that approval would permit Panhandle to eliminate its existing gathering rates and would result
in a decrease in Field Zone transportation rates. Panhandle also indicates that its customers would not be exposed
to the potential of Order No. 636 transition costs associated with the stranded investment of any gathering facilities
in the future. It is then indicated that, upon transfer of the facilities to Field Services, the facilities would be
operated on a stand-alone, open-access basis. It is also indicated that Field Services would be responsible for all
of the financial, economic, operational and business risks associated with the facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panhandle proposes to transfer at net book value 54 distinct gathering systems. Panhandle indicates that as of April
30, 1993, the net book value of the facilities to be transferred was $39,012,101. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Panhandle also proposes to further amend in Docket No. CP90&hyph;1050&hyph;002 a pending application filed in Docket
No. CP90&hyph;1050&hyph;000, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to conform its application to reflect the abandonment of its gathering facilities to Field Services and to update
the list of facilities proposed to be certificated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
nunc pro tunc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and/or refunctionalized, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open
to public inspection. Panhandle proposes to reduce from 283 to 94 the facilities proposed to be refunctionalized
from gathering to transmission in the application to amend filed in Docket No. CP90&hyph;1050&hyph;001. Panhandle
also proposes to refunctionalize from gathering to transmission 74 other facilities not previously requested to
be refunctionalized. Panhandle estimates the book value of the facilities proposed to be refunctionalized from
gathering to transmission in the amended application in Docket No. CP90&hyph;1050&hyph;002 at $4,623,276.

Houston, Texas 77056&hyph;5310, filed a petition for declaratory order in Docket No. CP94&hyph;152&hyph;000,
requesting that the Commission declare that neither Field Services' proposed acquisition, ownership, and operation
of certain natural gas gathering systems and related facilities presently owned by Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company
(Panhandle), Field Services' affiliate, nor any of Field Services' facilities or services would subject Field Services
or any portion of its facilities or services to the jurisdiction of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in
the petition which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Panhandle's West End gathering systems are facilities used for the gathering of natural gas and therefore exempt
from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Field Services would not be a ``natural gas company'' pursuant to Section 2(6) of the Natural Gas Act by virtue of
its proposed acquisition, ownership, and operation of such facilities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The gathering services that Field Services seeks to perform as described in the petition would be exempt from the
Commission's jurisdiction under section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Field Services' rates and charges for gathering services would not be subject to the Commission's jurisdiction
pursuant to sections 4 and 5 of the Natural Gas Act.

 52 FERC &para; 61,268 (1990), and as exhibited by the size, pressure, length, configuration, and utilization of each
of the gathering systems or groups of gathering systems. It is indicated that each of the 54 gathering systems (1) operates
at low-gathering-line pressure, (2) consists of discrete sections of generally small-diameter pipe, (3) is in a
typical ``spider-web'' or ``rib-like'' gathering configuration in appearance, (4) has wells along its length,
(5) is located behind compression which boosts pressures from low, wellhead pressures so that the gas can enter Panhandle's
mainline transmission system, or (6) is located behind a processing plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Field Services states that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Panhandle. Field Services describes the facilities
to be transferred as the West End Systems of Panhandle in Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Field Services indicates
that these facilities are the subject of Panhandle's companion abandonment application filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;151&hyph;000
and Panhandle's application in Docket No. CP90&hyph;1050&hyph;002 to further amend its pending application in
Docket No. CP90&hyph;1050&hyph;000,

wetlands, stated in this interim rule. However, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided a number of suggestions that may allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule to more adequately respond to questions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding land eligibility, owner obligations and

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, requires States to develop and implement permit programs to ensure that municipal
solid waste landfills (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste will comply with the revised Federal
Criteria (40 CFR part 258). RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C) requires the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(USEPA) to determine whether States have adequate permit programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule
for such determinations. The USEPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing the State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which the USEPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal MSWLF
permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of
the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities
and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements.
The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs
provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions.
Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved MSWLF permit programs can use the site-specific
flexibility provided by the revised Federal Criteria to the extent the State/Tribe MSWLF permit program allows such
flexibility. The USEPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility,
the revised Federal Criteria apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ohio applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. At the same time, Ohio proposed modifications
to current regulations that will facilitate full approval of its solid waste program. The rules contained in the proposed
revisions to the Ohio Administrative Code (OAC), Chapter 3745&hyph;27, add definitions and requirements that are
no less stringent than portions of the revised Federal Criteria. The specific revised Federal Criteria that Ohio
will incorporate are identified in the Ohio Solid Waste Program Application for U.S. EPA Authorization, October
1993. The USEPA reviewed Ohio's application and has made a tentative determination that the combination of Ohio's
existing MSWLF permit program and the incorporation of certain portions of the revised Federal Criteria will be adequate
to assure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. The Ohio application for program adequacy determination
is available for public review and comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA has also received the proposed revisions to the regulations for review. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Regulations, OAC&hyph;3745&hyph;27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA), December 23, 1993. Review of the finalized OEPA regulations will
occur prior to the USEPA's final determination of program adequacy. If the OEPA regulations, when fully promulgated
and effective, are essentially unchanged from proposed and are comparable to the revised Federal Criteria, the USEPA
may approve the Ohio solid waste program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although RCRA does not require USEPA to hold a hearing on any determination to approve a State/Tribal MSWLF permit
program, the USEPA Region 5 may schedule an opportunity for a public hearing on this tentative determination. Details
appear below in the ``DATES'' section.

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1991, the USEPA promulgated revised Federal Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA,
as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop permitting programs
to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the revised Federal Criteria. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005 that the USEPA
determine the adequacy of State MSWLF permit programs to ensure compliance with the revised Federal Criteria. To
fulfill these requirements, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing the State/Tribal Implementation
Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. The USEPA interprets
the requirements for States or Tribes to develop adequate programs for permits or other forms of prior approval to
impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing
MSWLFs that are technically comparable to the revised Federal Criteria. Next, the State/Tribe must have the authority
to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe
also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA.
Finally, the USEPA believes that the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement
authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator who fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an adequate program based on the interpretation outlined
above. The USEPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the State/Tribal Implementation
Rule. The USEPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF permit program
before it gives full approval to a MSWLF permit program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As provided in the revised Federal Criteria, USEPA's national Subtitle D standards took effect on October 9, 1993.
On October 1, 1993, USEPA published a final ruling which modified the effective date of the landfill criteria for certain
classifications of landfills (58 FR 51536). Thus, for certain small landfills that accept less than 100 tons of waste
per day, the Federal landfill criteria will not be effective until April 9, 1994, instead of October 9, 1993. The exact
classifications of landfills and details on the effective date extensions are contained in the final rule. See 58
FR 51536 (October 1, 1993).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1993, Ohio submitted an application for program adequacy determination. The USEPA has reviewed Ohio's
application and has tentatively determined that the combination of the State's existing permit program and the incorporation
of certain portions of the revised Federal Criteria will ensure full compliance with all of the revised Federal Criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Ohio regulations, contained in OAC&hyph;3745&hyph;27, currently contain the following elements that are considered
equivalent to the revised Federal Criteria:

1. Consideration of other Federal laws (USEPA approval is for current Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40
CFR 258.3);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Location restrictions for floodplains, fault areas, seismic impact zones, and unstable areas (USEPA approval
is for current Ohio requirements that are comparable to 40 CFR 258.11, 258.13, 258.14, and 258.15); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Operating criteria for daily cover material, disease vector control, air criteria, access restrictions, and

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Financial assurance criteria for corrective action (USEPA approval would be for proposed Ohio requirements that
are comparable to 40 CFR 258.73). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The elements of the revised Federal Criteria to be incorporated into the Ohio permit program (1&hyph;8 above) are
contained in the proposed regulations currently under promulgation by the OEPA. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Regulations, OAC&hyph;3745&hyph;27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, December 23, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of implementation of the revised Federal Criteria, Ohio is incorporating a ``unit concept'' into its
current landfill permitting process. Currently, large areas of unprepared land are permitted for a MSWLF facility
as opposed to discrete areas or units prepared for actual waste placement. Landfill owners and operators will be designating
``existing units'' at MSWLF facilities according to a specific procedure and guidelines established by the proposed
OEPA regulations. The procedure involves a clear delineation of the limits of waste placement, design components,
significant boundaries, and what the owner or operator designates as an existing unit or new unit(s) at a MSWLF facility
as of April 1994. The guidelines require that all areas designated as an existing unit are geographically contiguous
and the unfilled areas of the existing unit meet, at a minimum, specific design requirements which are equivalent
to the revised Federal Criteria. The revised OEPA regulations, when effective, will then apply to existing units,
which have been designated by the landfill owner or operator, as well as all new units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised Federal Criteria require a final cover system with an erosion layer underlain by an infiltration layer
comprised of at least 18 inches of earthen material with a permeability less than or equal to any bottom liner system
or no greater than 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
&hyph;5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cm/sec, whichever is less. Ohio's final cover design allows for a composite liner involving a flexible membrane liner
and a geocomposite clay liner in lieu of 18 inches of recompacted clay. The geocomposite component of the final cover
must be demonstrated to have a permeability less than or equal to 18 inches of recompacted clay with a permeability
of 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
&hyph;6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 cm/sec, which exceeds the Federal Criteria. The use of an alternative final cover design to achieve an equivalent
reduction in infiltration is allowed pursuant to 40 CFR 258.60(b).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the revised Federal Criteria require unfiltered groundwater samples to be used in laboratory analysis.
Currently, Ohio regulations require sampling and analysis procedures which ensure monitoring results that provide
an ``accurate representation'' of groundwater quality. This requirement can be interpreted to require unfiltered
samples. The USEPA intends to revisit this issue during a proposed rulemaking. If the proposed rulemaking upholds
the ban on field filtering, the State will be required to incorporate the provisions of 40 CFR 258.53(b) into its policy
regarding groundwater sampling and analysis procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Ohio program will differ from the revised Federal Criteria with respect to the general effective date of the requirements.
The planned effective date of the currently proposed Ohio regulations, which incorporate the Federal Criteria,
is April 1994. The rulemaking process in Ohio is extensive, involving the widespread circulation of draft regulations
to all interested parties, public comment periods and hearings, and legislative review and approval, a process which
takes a minimum of 8 to 12 months. The USEPA understands that State law cannot be retroactive and feels that an effective
date of April 1994 for revised State rules incorporating the Federal Criteria will be adequate. However, as stated
previously, the effective date of the revised Federal Criteria remains October 9, 1993, unless a facility qualifies
for the extension granted to certain small MSWLFs. See 58 FR 51536 (October 1, 1993). All landfill owners and operators
in Ohio were notified directly by USEPA that MSWLFs will be regulated under both existing State rules as well as the
revised Federal Criteria contained in 40 CFR part 258 from October 9, 1993, until the date that the revised Ohio rules
are fully promulgated and effective.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, the USEPA has a final draft of the proposed OEPA regulations. If the OEPA regulations, when
fully promulgated and effective, remain unchanged from proposed and adequately incorporate the revised Federal
Criteria listed above, the USEPA may approve the Ohio solid waste program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public may submit written comments on USEPA's tentative determination until March 1, 1994. The USEPA will consider
all public comments on its tentative determination that are received during the public comment period and during
any public hearing, if held. Issues raised by those comments will be the basis for a final determination of adequacy
for Ohio's program. The USEPA will make a final decision on whether or not to fully approve Ohio's program by April 29,
1994, and will give notice of it in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA to enforce
the revised Federal Criteria in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA explained in the preamble to the final revised Federal Criteria, the
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USEPA expects that any owner or operator complying with the provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by the USEPA
should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria. See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991).

Section 90.673 requires any Expanded Mobile Service Provider (EMSP) to submit, along with any application for modification
of its EMSP license to include new base station facilities, certain information necessary to determine whether the
proposed modification complies with applicable rules. Specifically, the applicant for EMSP license modification
must submit a list of all co-channel facilities and previously filed applications for such facilities, not under
the control of the EMSP licensee, within 113 km of the proposed base station, a description of how the proposed base
station provides protection to these co-channel facilities as required under &sect;90.621(b) or 90.675, and certification
that the proposed station or modification will afford such protection to the other facilities. The request for modification
must include the co-channel stations' call signs, coordinates, effective radiated power and directional antenna
height above average terrain. This data is necessary to ensure that the Commission will not authorize EMSP operations
where they could cause harmful interference to the SMR systems of co-channel licensees. Furthermore, the information
collection will lessen the administrative burdens and delays that would be created if the Commission performed the
engineering analyses that produce this information.

Section 90.677 requires any Expanded Mobile Service Provider (EMSP) to submit certain information necessary to
determine whether the EMSP has constructed a system that serves 80 percent of the geographic area or 80 percent of the
population in the Rand-McNally Major Trading Area (MTA) covered by the EMSP license. Specifically, the applicant
for EMSP license modification must submit a U.S. Geological Survey map(s) of the MTA, depicting the licensee's authorized
base station sites within the MTA and their respective 40 db contours, a description of how the stations serve the required
land area or population, and an explanation and justification of any alternative method used to calculate contours
aside from the Commission's R6602 F(50,50) curves with a 9 db adjustment. This data is necessary to ensure that licensees
construct and place into operation their authorized channels so as to provide effective service to the public. Furthermore,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with the authorities contained in 12 U.S.C. 1821(c), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
was duly appointed receiver for each of the financial institutions specified in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The FDIC has determined that the proceeds which can be realized from the liquidation of the assets of these receivership
estates are insufficient to satisfy all classes of claims, asserted or unasserted against the receivership estate.
Therefore, upon satisfaction of secured claims, depositor claims and claims which have priority over depositors
under applicable state law, no amount will remain or will be recovered sufficient to allow a dividend, distribution
or payment to any other creditor and therefore the claim of any such creditor is worthless.

The organizations listed in this notice have applied under  225.23(a)(2) or (f) of the Board's Regulation Y (12 CFR
225.23(a)(2) or (f)) for the Board's approval under section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(c)(8))
and  225.21(a) of Regulation Y (12 CFR 225.21(a)) to acquire or control voting securities or assets of a company engaged
in a nonbanking activity that is listed in  225.25 of Regulation Y as closely related to banking and permissible for
bank holding companies. Unless otherwise noted, such activities will be conducted throughout the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each application is available for immediate inspection at the Federal Reserve Bank indicated. Once the application
has been accepted for processing, it will also be available for inspection at the offices of the Board of Governors.
Interested persons may express their views in writing on the question whether consummation of the proposal can ``reasonably
be expected to produce benefits to the public, such as greater convenience, increased competition, or gains in efficiency,
that outweigh possible adverse effects, such as undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition,
conflicts of interests, or unsound banking practices.'' Any request for a hearing on this question must be accompanied
by a statement of the reasons a written presentation would not suffice in lieu of a hearing, identifying specifically
any questions of fact that are in dispute, summarizing the evidence that would be presented at a hearing, and indicating
how the party commenting would be aggrieved by approval of the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise noted, comments regarding each of these applications must be received at the Reserve Bank indicated
for the application or the offices of the Board of Governors not later than February 7, 1994.

Description: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New legislation in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1994 authorizes entitlement funding to States
and certain Indian Tribes and Tribal organizations for family preservation and family support services. The major
purpose of family preservation services is to help alleviate family crises that otherwise might lead to the foster
care placement of children, e.g., intensive in-home services, respite care, and services for adoptive parents.
The major purpose of family support services is to provide preventive services to families to help alleviate stress
(e.g., to prevent child abuse), increase parents' child-rearing abilities and parenting skills, and assist families
to use other available community resources, e.g., center-based services, home visiting, and early developmental
screening of children.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A DMF is a submission to FDA that may be used to provide confidential, detailed information about facilities, processes,
or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storing of one or more human drugs (see 21 CFR 314.420).
The submission of a DMF is not required by law or FDA regulation. A DMF is submitted solely at the discretion of the holder.
The information contained in the DMF may be used to support an investigational new drug application, a new drug application,
an abbreviated new drug application, another DMF, an export application, or amendments and supplements to any of
these. FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) reviews the DMF only when it is referenced in such submissions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five types of DMF's exist regarding the following topics: Type I_ manufacturing site, facilities, operating procedures,
and personnel; Type II_drug substance, drug substance intermediate, and material used in their preparation, or
drug product; Type III_packaging material; Type IV_excipient, colorant, flavor, essence, or material used in their
preparation; and Type V_FDA-accepted reference information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CDER is considering ways to improve the DMF system, especially Type II DMF's, which often constitute a critical part
of a submission. The workshop will focus on alternative ways for CDER to review Type II DMF's for drug substances and
intermediates. CDER's Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Coordinating Committee has recommended changes
to the DMF review process in a report entitled ``Recommendations for Improvement in FDA's Drug Master File System,''
dated November 2, 1993. The report is available from the Freedom of Information Office (address above) or may be viewed
at the Dockets Management Branch (address above) [Docket No. 90S&hyph;0308 (document #M&hyph;203)].

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Meetings of Panel</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given of the first meeting of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Human Embryo Research Panel,
a panel of special consultants to the Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD), NIH, established to recommend guidelines
for Federal funding of human embryo research. The Panel's first meeting will be held February 2&hyph;3, 1994, from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the 2nd, and 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on the 3rd. The meeting will be held at the Bethesda Marriott Hotel,
5151 Pooks Hill Road, Bethesda, Maryland. Dates of subsequent Panel meetings will be determined at the first meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until June 1993, Federal regulations governing research on human subjects (45 CFR part 46) required research involving
in vitro fertilization (IVF) to be reviewed by an Ethics Advisory Board (EAB). Because of the absence of an EAB since
1980, Federal funding of IVF protocols was not possible. With the enactment of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993 (Pub.
L. 103&hyph;43), the regulatory provision requiring EAB review of IVF proposals was nullified. As a result, IVF proposals,
as well as research involving human embryos that result from IVF or other sources, may now be considered for Federal
funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIH has received a number of applications for support in this area and in the related field of parthenogenesis.
However, before proceeding with the consideration of specific human embryo research proposals for funding, the
NIH must address the profound moral and ethical issues raised by the use of human embryos in research and develop guidelines
to govern the review and conduct of Federally-funded research. Panel members will be asked to consider various areas
of research involving the human embryo and provide advice as to those areas they view to be acceptable for Federal funding,
areas that warrant additional review, and areas that are unacceptable for Federal support. For those areas of research
considered acceptable for Federal funding, the Panel will be asked to recommend specific guidelines for the review
and conduct of this research. Ethical issues related to human germ-line gene modification are not within the Panel's
purview. The Panel's final report will be presented to the ACD for review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIH invites public input into this process. Those who wish to share their views about Federal funding of human embryo
research may address the Panel during public comment periods that will be scheduled during each meeting. The public
comment period during the first meeting is scheduled to take place February 2 from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Those who wish to address
the Panel at this or subsequent meetings are asked to contact Ms. Peggy Schnoor, by telephoning 301&hyph;496&hyph;1454
or by sending a facsimile message to 301&hyph;402&hyph;0280 or 301&hyph;402&hyph;1759. Oral statements must not
exceed five minutes in length, and opportunities to present statements will be determined by the order in which requests
are received. Those who wish to present oral statements should forward a one-page summary of their remarks in advance
of the scheduled presentation date. Individuals and organizations may also submit written comments of any length
to the Panel. These should be forwarded to the NIH in care of Ms. Schnoor at 9000 Rockville Pike, Building 1, room 218,
Bethesda, Maryland 20892.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NIH will endeavor to provide seating for all members of the public who wish to attend the meetings. Individuals
are, however, asked to notify the NIH of their interest in attending by using the telephone or facsimile numbers listed
above. Individuals who require special accommodations are also asked to contact Ms. Schnoor at the above number.
General questions about the Panel or the first meeting should also be directed to Ms. Schnoor.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This is notice in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is contemplating the grant of an exclusive world-wide license to
practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Application SN 07/617,910, entitled ``Cell Stress Transcriptional
Factors'' to StressTech Biomedical, Inc. of San Francisco, CA. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned
to the United States of America.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. It is anticipated that this license will be limited to the fields of commercial screening assay
services and kits provided to third parties. This prospective exclusive license may be granted unless within 60 days
from the date of this published notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant
of the license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The patent application is based upon the observation that activation of heat shock proteins in an organism indicates
elevated or environmental temperatures or a variety of other environmental stresses. Activation involves binding
of a heat shock factor (HSF) to heat shock elements (HSE) and consequent transcription of heat shock genes. This method
for detecting the accumulation of HSF in the nucleus of stressed cells involves novel activators for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Drosophilia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and human HSF, polynucleotides encoding those activators, and antibodies to natural and recombinant DNA. The method
may also be used to monitor and diagnose the effects of abnormal stresses, including disease, on cells.

ADDRESSES: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Requests for a copy of this patent application, inquiries, comments and other materials relating to the contemplated
license should be directed to: Mr. Steven M. Ferguson, Technology Licensing Specialist, Office of Technology Transfer,

3. CD4+ T-Lymphocyte Testing Impact Evaluation_New_The purpose of the proposed survey is to evaluate the relative
effectiveness of each of the initiatives of CDC's Division of Laboratory Services, while controlling for the influence
of non-CDC factors in improving the quality of CD4+ T-cell testing in clinical flow cytometry laboratories. This
study will collect new information from CD4+ T-cell testing staff to characterize changes in laboratory practices
in both MPEP and non-MPEP laboratories. Information obtained from this study will be used to identify items that influence
laboratories to change.

The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of furan, used primarily as an intermediate in the synthesis and preparation of other organic
compounds and also in the preparation of numerous polymeric compounds used for preparation of temperature-resistant
structural laminates. Copolymers of maleic acid and furan form complexes with alkaline earth ions and are used in
metals, foodstuffs, and machine dishwashing products as alternatives to phosphorus- and nitrogen-containing
detergents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two-year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering to both sexes of rats doses of 0,

Toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by feeding groups of 60 F344 rats of each sex diets containing
0, 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole and groups of 60 B6C3F1 mice of each sex diets containing 0, 666, 2,000, or 6,000
ppm o-nitroanisole for 103 weeks. In a companion study, male and female rats were fed 0, 6,000, or 18,000 ppm o-nitroanisole
for 6 months and maintained on untreated feed for 11/2 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the conditions of these feed studies there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity1 of o-nitroanisole
in male and female F344 rats that received diets containing 6,000 to 18,000 ppm for 6 months based on overall increased
incidences of benign and malignant neoplasms of the urinary bladder, transitional cell neoplasms of the kidney,
and benign and malignant neoplasms of the large intestine. There was a chemical-related increased incidence of mononuclear
cell leukemia in male and female rats receiving diets containing 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 2 years.
Marginally increased incidences of uncommon renal tubule neoplasms in male rats and forestomach neoplasms in male
and female rats were considered uncertain findings. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole
in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of benign and malignant hepatocellular neoplasms. There was some
evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular
adenomas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Increased severity of nephropathy in male rats, and increased incidences of focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule
epithelium and forestomach ulcers in male rats, and of transitional cell hyperplasia of the urinary bladder, focal

The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and
carcinogenesis studies of pentachloroanisole, a chlorinated aromatic compound which is widely distributed at
low levels in the environment and in food products. Formation of pentachloroanisole in the environment may result
from the degradation of structurally related, commercially important, ubiquitous chlorinated aromatic compounds
such as pentachlorophenol and pentachloronitrobenzene which are known rodent toxins or carcinogens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two year toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering pentachloroanisole in corn oil
by gavage 5 days per week for up to 2 years to groups of 70 male and 70 female rats and mice of each sex. Male rats received
doses of 0, 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg of pentachloroanisole; female rats and mice received doses of 0, 20, and 40 mg/kg pentachloroanisole.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 of pentachloroanisole in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal
medulla. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of pentachloroanisole in female F344/N rats based
on marginally increased incidences of benign pheochromocytomas of the adrenal medulla. There was some evidence
of carcinogenic activity of pentachloroanisole in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidence of benign pheochromocytomas
of the adrenal medulla and hemangiosarcomas of the liver. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of pentachloroanisole
in female B6C3F1 mice given doses of 20 or 40 mg/kg.

Pentachloroanisole administration was associated with increased incidences of adrenal medulla hyperplasia in
female rats and increased incidences of pigmentation in the renal tubule epithelium, olfactory epithelium, and
hepatocytes of male and female rats. In addition, decreased incidences of pancreatic adenomas and focal hyperplasia
in male rats and decreased incidences of mammary gland fibroadenomas and uterine stromal polyps and sarcomas (combined)
in female rats were observed. Hyperthermia-related lesions in male rats receiving 20 or 40 mg/kg were considered
indirectly related to pentachloroanisole administration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pentachloroanisole administration was associated with increased incidences of adrenal medulla hyperplasia and
hypertrophy and hepatocellular mixed cell foci in male mice. In male and female mice, nonneoplastic liver lesions

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Twin Falls County, Idaho has made application to purchase 1083.77 acres of public land managed by the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), on which they propose to construct, operate and maintain a state of the art ``Subtitle D'' solid
waste facility. The proposed project is located near Hub Butte, 10 miles south of the City of Twin Falls, Idaho. The
purpose of the proposed facility would be to bring Twin Falls County into compliance with the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act (RCRA) and its associated regulations, 40 CFR 257 and 258 ``Subtitle D''. These regulations set forth
many new requirements for solid waste facilities that are in operation after April 9, 1993 that the existing facilities
in Twin Falls County do not meet. The proposed facility would be constructed and administered by Twin Falls County
and would be operated by a private contractor.

Publication of this Notice of Realty Action (NORA) terminates and replaces the NORA published under serial number
UTU&hyph;65199 on November 23, 1992, in Vol. 57, No. 220, Pages 53927 &amp; 53928 of the

The purpose of the land exchange is to acquire private land located in the Book Cliffs region of southeastern Uintah
County, Utah in exchange for public land. The offered private land, known locally as the Cripple Cowboy Ranch, is needed
to consolidate public land ownership within the Book Cliffs. Acquisition of the offered ranch property will enhance
resource management objectives to preserve crucial Rocky Mountain elk calving areas; protect habitat for mule deer,
black bear, and other wildlife species; improve and protect riparian habitat; enhance native fisheries and provide
for public access and recreational opportunities for future generations in the Book Cliffs region.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public land will be used to equalize land values for the offered private lands within the Book Cliffs pursuant to
the exchange agreement between RMEF and BLM. The exchange would proceed until such time as the values of the public
and private lands reach full equalization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to acquiring part of the Cripple Cowboy Ranch via land exchange, riparian lands and associated water rights
for portions of the offered ranch property may be removed from the above described pool of private lands to allow direct
purchase by the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disposal of the selected public lands would be subject to the following reservations and third party rights:

Public Law 94&hyph;235 established Chickasaw National Recreation Area on March 17, 1976. The legislation specified
that the total acreage of the recreation area may not exceed 10,000 acres. On December 9, 1991, a notice of a change in
the boundary was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Vol. 56, No. 236, page 64272. This notice revised the boundaries of the area as depicted on a map entitled ``Boundary
Map, Chickasaw National Recreation Area,'' Drawing No. 107/80027, dated April 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the process of transferring jurisdiction from the Bureau of Reclamation to the National Park Service in accordance
with the 1965 Memorandum of Agreement, three errors were made in mapping the original boundary and these errors were
perpetuated in subsequent mapping. The three areas requiring correction are described as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boundary Area ``A'' is located in the NW1/4 of section 6, Township 1 South, Range 3 East, Indian Meridian, Murray County,
Oklahoma. The original boundary is revised so as to exclude 41.16 acres which were never acquired by the Bureau of Reclamation
from H.H. Thomas or C.W. Purtle. This parcel was never intended to be a part of the Arbuckle Reservoir Project according
to the Memorandum of Agreement and the deed records for the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boundary Area''B&hyph;1'' is located in the NE1/4 of section 6, Township 1 South, Range 3 East, Indian Meridian, Murray
County, Oklahoma. The original boundary is revised so as to delete 10.10 acres that were conveyed to Glenn Haines by
the United States of America, as recorded on May 27, 1966, in Book 159, page 619, of the deed records of Murray County,
Oklahoma. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Boundary Area ``B&hyph;2'' is located in the NE1/4 of section 6, Township 1 South, Range 3 East, Indian Meridian, Murray
County, Oklahoma. The original boundary is revised so as to include 10.00 acres that were conveyed to the United States
of America by Glenn Haines and Janetta Haines, as recorded on May 27, 1966, in Book 159, page 617, of the deed records
of Murray County, Oklahoma. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, one change will add 10.00 acres and 2 changes will delete 51.26 acres, creating a net decrease of 41.26 acres.
With these corrections made to the recreation area boundary, the current total acreage is 9,888.83. The authority
for implementing this action is Public Law 94&hyph;235 (90 Stat. 235.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, notice is hereby given that the boundary of Chickasaw National Recreation Area should be revised as described

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and section 21002 of the
California Environmental Quality Act, Reclamation and the Coachella Valley Water District (Coachella) have issued
a joint draft environmental impact statement/draft environmental impact report (DEIS/DEIR) on a proposed canal
lining project. The project involves lining the remaining unlined sections of the 70-foot-wide Coachella Canal
between Siphons 7 and 14, and Siphons 15 and 32, while the canal continues to deliver irrigation water. The canal, which
delivers Colorado River water to Coachella, lies in Riverside and Imperial Counties. The preferred alternative
in the DEIS/DEIR is to line the existing canal while diverting the waterflow around the construction area by temporary
pipes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public Law 100&hyph;675 authorizes the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) to allow lining the unlined sections
of canal in order to make the conserved water available in California. No Federal funds have been authorized for the
project. In accordance with Public Law 100&hyph;675, Coachella and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern
California may provide non-Federal funding for the project under contract with the Secretary. Lining the canal would
reduce seepage by approximately 31,000 acre-feet per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mitigation of impacts to wetlands habitat could require approximately 5,000 acre-feet per year from the canal, resulting
in a net amount of approximately 26,000 acre-feet of conserved water per year.

Patrick D. Broe (Mr. Broe), a noncarrier, has filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of Central Kansas Railway,
Limited Liability Company (CKRLLC), upon CKRLLC's becoming a rail carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CKRLLC, a noncarrier, has concurrently filed a notice of exemption in Finance Docket No. 32430, Central Kansas Railway,
Limited Liability Company_Acquisition and Operation Exemption_Central Kansas Railway, Inc., and Certain Incidental
Line Segments of The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company and Burlington Northern Railroad Company, to acquire
and operate: (1) All of the rail lines of Central Kansas Railway, Inc. (CKR), located in Kansas and Oklahoma; (2) two
rail lines in Kansas from The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company (Santa Fe); (3) one rail line in Kansas from
the Burlington Northern Railroad Company; and (4) incidental trackage rights over six segments of track owned by
Santa Fe, one segment of track owned by Union Pacific Railroad Company, one segment of track owned by Missouri Pacific
Railroad Company, and one segment of track owned by St. Louis Southwestern Railway Company. The parties intended
to consummate that transaction on December 28, 1993, or later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Broe is a noncarrier individual who will directly control CKRLLC upon its becoming a carrier. Mr. Broe also directly
controls Panhandle Northern Railroad Company (exempted in Finance Docket No. 32377), The Broe Companies, Inc.,
a holding company that directly controls CKR, and noncarriers Great Western Railway Company (Great Western) and
Railco, Inc. (Railco). Great Western directly controls rail carriers, Great Western Railway of Colorado, Inc.,
Great Western Railway Company of Iowa, Inc., and Great Western Railway of Oregon, Inc. Railco controls noncarrier
Chicago West Pullman Transportation Company, which in turn, controls six class III railroads: Chicago West Pullman
&amp; Southern Railroad Company, Georgia Woodlands Railroad Company, Newburgh &amp; South Shore Railroad Company,
Chicago Rail Link, Manufacturers' Junction Railway Company, and Kansas Southwestern Railway Company. The existing
common control relationship among these carriers is discussed in Finance Docket No. 32362. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is a transaction within a corporate family of the type specifically exempted from prior review and approval under
49 CFR 1180.2(d)(3). It will not result in adverse changes in service levels, significant operational changes, or
a change in the competitive balance with carriers outside the corporate family. The purpose of this transaction is
to have the assets of CKR transferred to CKRLLC, a limited liability corporation, for estate planning purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions
set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke
will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Karl Morell,
Taylor, Morell &amp; Gitomer, suite 210, 919 18th St., NW., Washington, DC 20006.

Valparaiso, in Kosciusko, Marshall, Starke, La Porte and Porter Counties, IN. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A certificate will be issued authorizing abandonment unless within 15 days after publication of this notice the Commission
finds that: (1) A financially responsible person has offered financial assistance (through subsidy or purchase)
to enable rail service to continue; and (2) it is likely that such assistance would fully compensate Conrail. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests for public use conditions must be filed with the Commission and Conrail within 10 days after publication.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any offers of financial assistance must be filed with the Commission and Conrail no later than 10 days from the date
of publication of this Notice. The following notation must be typed in bold face on the lower left-hand corner of the

Peter A. Gilbertson, H. Terry Hearst, Bruce A. Lieberman, R. Lawrence McCaffrey, Jr., and Harold F. Parmly, noncarrier
individuals, have filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of Louisville &amp; Indiana Railroad Company
(LIRC) when it becomes a carrier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LIRC concurrently filed a notice of exemption in Louisville &amp; I. R. Co._Acq. and Oper. Exemp._Consolidated Rail
Corp., Finance Docket No. 32440, to acquire and operate approximately 115 miles of rail line owned by Consolidated
Rail Corporation in Indiana and Kentucky. LIRC expects to consummate the transaction on or about March 12, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four of the filing parties are officers or directors of the Chicago, SouthShore &amp; South Bend Railroad (CSS), a
class III rail carrier operating in Indiana and Illinois. All are minority shareholders in CSS's corporate general
partner, SouthShore Corporation (a noncarrier), and three are officers and directors of that entity as well. The
parties state that: (1) The railroads will not connect with each other or with any railroads in their corporate family;
(2) the continuance in control is not part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads
with each other or any railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier.
The transaction is therefore exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Summit states that: (1) The properties operated by these four carriers do not connect with each other; (2) the continuance
in control is not a part of a series of transactions that would connect the four railroads with each other or any other
railroad currently controlled by Summit; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. Therefore, the
transaction is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2).

 (``the Act''), the Southwest Research Institute (``SwRI'') has filed written notifications simultaneously with
the Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission disclosing (1) the identities of the parties and (2) the nature
and objective of the research project. The notifications were filed for the purpose of invoking the Act's provisions
limiting the recovery of antitrust plaintiffs to actual damages under specified circumstances. Pursuant to section
6(b) of the Act, the identities of the parties are Daimler Benz, Stuttgart, Germany; Nissan Motor Company, Ltd., through
Nissan Research and Development, Inc., Farmington, MI; and Nippon Shokubai, Hyogo, Japan. The objective of the research
project is to investigate the feasibility of preheating on automotive exhaust catalytic converter using stored
thermal exhaust energy through the evaluation of several reactor designs using various storage media such as packed
beds and phase change materials, so as to define the medium's operating conditions; obtain and analyze potential
media; design and evaluate a variety of storage beds; examine insulation and heat transfer aspects of the storage
medium and container design; and outline a prototype system for implementation on a vehicle. Membership in the project
remains open, and the parties intend to file additional written notification disclosing all changes in membership
to the group research project.

Minimum Wages for Federal and Federally Assisted Construction; General Wage Determination Decisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedeas decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution
Avenue, NW., room S&hyph;3014, Washington, DC 20210.

Penetrators, Inc., Midland and Houston, Texas; Negative Determination on Reconsideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 13, 1993, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. This notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 27, 1993 (58 FR 68440).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The former workers stated that the workers produced crude oil and natural gas and should be certified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New findings on reconsideration show that the workers perform downhole drilling and stimulation services to rejuvenate
new and existing oil wells. These services are provided to unaffiliated production firms in the oil and gas industry.
The predominate portion of their services is performed on old wells. Only a small portion of their work is performed
on new wells. Accordingly, the workers do not meet the on-site requirements for drilling exploration services necessary
for a worker group certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the price of oil is not a worker group eligibility criterion for certification under the Trade Act of 1974.
Accordingly, a decline in the price of crude oil, in itself, would not form a basis for a worker group certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Trade Act was not intended to provide TAA benefits to everyone who is in some way affected by increased imports but
only to those who experienced a decline in sales or production and employment and an increase in imports of like or directly
competitive products which contributed importantly to declines in sales or production and employment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After reconsideration, I affirm the original notice of negative determination of eligibility to apply for adjustment
assistance to workers and former workers of Penetrators, Inc., in Midland, Texas and Houston, Texas.

<DOCTITLE>Plains Petroleum Operating Co., Southern District, Midland, Texas; Revised Determination on Reconsideration</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 22, 1993, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the Plains Petroleum Operating Company, Southern District, in Midland, Texas.
The notice will soon be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation findings show that the company submitted corporate sales and production data instead of data for the
Southern District of Plains Petroleum Operating Company in Midland, Texas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new findings on reconsideration show that crude oil and natural gas sales and production decreased in the 12 month
period ending in July 1993 compared to the same period in 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other findings on reconsideration show substantial worker separations in 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. imports of crude oil and natural gas increased in 1992 compared to 1991 and in the first six months of 1993 compared
to the same period in 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's survey showed major customers reducing their purchases of crude oil from the Midland facility and
increasing their purchases of imported crude oil.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration it is concluded that increased imports
of articles like or directly competitive with the production of crude oil and natural gas in the Southern District
of Plains Petroleum Operating Company in Midland, Texas contributed importantly to the total or partial separation
of workers at the Plains Petroleum Operating Company. In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I
make the following revised determination:

All workers of the Plains Petroleum Operating Company Southern District, in Midland, Texas who became totally or
partially separated from employment on or after August 3, 1992 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under
section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that a health care facility seeking to use nonimmigrant aliens as registered
nurses first attest to the Department of Labor (DOL) that it is taking significant steps to develop, recruit and retain
United States (U.S.) workers in the nursing profession. The law also requires that these foreign nurses will not adversely
affect U.S. nurses and that the foreign nurses will be treated fairly. The facility's attestation must be on file with
DOL before the Immigration and Naturalization Service will consider the facility's H&hyph;1A visa petitions for
bringing nonimmigrant registered nurses to the United States. 26 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) and 1181(m). The
regulations implementing the nursing attestation program are at 20 CFR part 655 and 29 CFR part 504, 55 FR 50500 (December
6, 1990). The Employment and Training Administration, pursuant to 20 CFR 655.310(c), is publishing the following
list of facilities which have submitted attestations which have been accepted for filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The list of facilities is published so that U.S. registered nurses, and other persons and organizations can be aware
of health care facilities that have requested foreign nurses for their staffs. If U.S. registered nurses or other
persons wish to examine the attestation (on Form ETA 9029) and the supporting documentation, the facility is required
to make the attestation and documentation available. Telephone numbers of the facilities' chief executive officers
also are listed, to aid public inquiries. In addition, attestations and supporting short explanatory statements
(but not the full supporting documentation) are available for inspection at the address for the Employment and Training
Administration set forth in

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that a health care facility seeking to use nonimmigrant aliens as registered
nurses first attest to the Department of Labor (DOL) that it is taking significant steps to develop, recruit and retain
United States (U.S.) workers in the nursing profession. The law also requires that these foreign nurses will not adversely
affect U.S. nurses and that the foreign nurses will be treated fairly. The facility's attestation must be on file with
DOL before the Immigration and Naturalization Service will consider the facility's H&hyph;1A visa petitions for
bringing nonimmigrant registered nurses to the United States. 26 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) and 1181(m). The
regulations implementing the nursing attestation program are at 20 CFR part 655 and 29 CFR part 504, 55 FR 50500 (December
6, 1990). The Employment and Training Administration, pursuant to 20 CFR 655.310(c), is publishing the following
list of facilities which have submitted attestations which have been accepted for filing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The list of facilities is published so that U.S. registered nurses, and other persons and organizations can be aware
of health care facilities that have requested foreign nurses for their staffs. If U.S. registered nurses or other
persons wish to examine the attestation (on Form ETA 9029) and the supporting documentation, the facility is required
to make the attestation and documentation available. Telephone numbers of the facilities' chief executive officers
also are listed, to aid public inquiries. In addition, attestations and supporting short explanatory statements
(but not the full supporting documentation) are available for inspection at the address for the Employment and Training
Administration set forth in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed meetings are for the purpose of panel review, discussion, evaluation and recommendation on applications
for financial assistance under the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act of 1965, as amended, including
discussion of information given in confidence to the agency grant applications. Because the proposed meetings will
consider information that is likely to disclose: (1) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential; or (2) information of a personal nature the disclosure of which would
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, pursuant to authority granted me by the Chairman's
Delegation of Authority to Close Advisory Committee meetings, dated July 19, 1993, I have determined that these meetings
will be closed to the public pursuant to subsections (c) (4), and (6) of section 552b of Title 5, United States Code.

Vermont Electric Generation and Transmission Cooperative, Inc., (Vermont) is the holder of a 0.41259-percent ownership
share in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1. Vermont's interest in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, is governed by License No.
NPF&hyph;86 issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the NRC) pursuant to 10 CFR part 50 on March 15, 1990,
in Docket No. 50&hyph;443. Under this license, only North Atlantic Energy Service Corporation (North Atlantic),
acting as agent and representative of 12 joint owners listed in the license, has the authority to operate Seabrook
Station, Unit No. 1. Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, is located in Rockingham County, New Hampshire.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated August 27, 1993, North Atlantic proposed an amendment to License No. NPF&hyph;86 which would change
the license to reflect the transfer of Vermont's 0.41259-percent ownership share in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1,
to North Atlantic Energy Corporation (NAEC).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, Vermont filed a claim against Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) with the United States Bankruptcy
Court which was then hearing a petition from PSNH for reorganization under Chapter II of the United States Bankruptcy
Code. Vermont's claim sought redress for damages that were alleged to have been incurred while PSNH had been the managing
agent for the Seabrook Station. In November 1990, the two parties reached a settlement which included an agreement
by PSNH or its designee to purchase Vermont's share of the Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, subject to obtaining the necessary
approvals from all regulatory agencies. In December 1990, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order approving the stipulation
that PSNH and Vermont had filed describing the settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1992, in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization for PSNH that was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, Northeast
Utilities (NU) acquired PSNH in merger transactions and, after receipt of NRC approval, NAEC (a weekly formed and
wholly owned subsidiary of NU) acquired PSNH's interest in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1. The transfer of Vermont's
ownership share in Seabrook to NAEC will consummate the settlement entered into by Vermont and PSNH.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The transfer of rights under License No. NPF&hyph;86 is subject to the NRC's approval under 10 CFR 50.80(a). After
reviewing information submitted in the August 27, 1993, letter and other information before the Commission, the
NRC staff has determined that the transfer of Vermont's interest in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1 to NAEC (which is already
a licensee) does not affect NAEC's technical or financial qualifications to be a holder of License No. NPF&hyph;86,
and the license transfer is otherwise consistent with applicable provisions of law, regulations, and orders issued
by the Commission.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.21, 51.32, and 51.35, an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 5, 1994 (59 FR 605). Accordingly, based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission has determined
that issuance of this order will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 161b and 161i of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as amended), 42 U.S.C. 2201, and 10
CFR 50.80, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
it is hereby ordered 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that the transfer of control of Vermont Electric Generation and Transmission Cooperative, Inc.'s 0.41259-percent
undivided ownership interest in Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, to North Atlantic Energy Corporation is approved subject
to the following: (1) Should the transfer not be completed by May 30, 1994, this Order will be null and void and (2) on
application and for good cause shown, this Order may be extended for a short period beyond May 30, 1994.

1. Applicant is a diversified open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust.
On January 15, 1992, applicant filed a notification of registration pursuant to section 8(1) of the Act and a registration
statement under section 8(b) of the Act and under the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement was declared
effective on April 13, 1982, and applicant commenced its initial public offering on that date.

2. On June 14, 1993, applicant's board of trustees approved, subject to shareholder approval, an Agreement and Plan
or Reorganization and Liquidation (the ``Reorganization'') providing for the transfer of all or substantially
all of the assets and liabilities of applicant to Gradison Cash Reserves Trust (the ``Acquiring Fund'') in exchange
for shares of the Gradison-McDonald U.S. Government Reserves Series of Gradison Cash Reserves Trust (``GM&hyph;US
Shares'') and the assumption of liabilities. According to a registration statement filed by the Acquiring Fund on
July 1, 1993, containing a proxy statement/prospectus, the Board of Trustees of applicant, including the trustees
who are not ``interested persons'' of applicant as that term is defined in the Act, concluded that the Reorganization
would be in the best interests of the shareholders of applicant, and that the interests of applicant's shareholders
would not be diluted as a result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The registration statement on Form N&hyph;14 and the proxy statement/prospectus contained therein was furnished
to applicant's shareholders on or about August 15, 1993. At a special meeting of shareholders held on September 15,
1993, the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding voting shares of applicant approved the Reorganization.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On September 24, 1993, 24,964,000 shares of applicant were outstanding at a net asset value of $1.00 per share. At
such date, aggregate net assets of applicant were $24,964,000. As of September 24, 1993, GM&hyph;US Shares were distributed
to applicant's shareholders. Each shareholder received the proportion of GM&hyph;US Shares received by applicant
that the number of applicant shares owned by each such shareholder bore to the number of outstanding applicant shares.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
An EA for the proposed project was approved for circulation on December 28, 1993. Subsequent distribution included
State and Federal agencies and interested parties identified during project planning and scoping. The EA discusses
a proposal (build alternative) to construct a new 1.1 mile Fleshman Way roadway on a route north of 16th Avenue in Asotin
County, Washington. The proposed improvements would also involve the reconstruction of the existing 15th Street
between 16th Avenue and Bridge Street (U.S. Highway 12) for a distance of about 1.5 miles. It would also include a new
interchange or intersection in the vicinity of 13th Street and a new intersection on 16th Avenue and Fleshman Way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Improvements to the corridor are considered necessary to address existing traffic operations problems, to meet
projected traffic demand and to improve safety. Existing deficient features include lane and shoulder widths, horizontal
and vertical alignments, and pavement structure. The proposed project is included in the Asotin County and the City
of Clarkston Comprehensive Plans as a link between U.S. Highway 12 west of Clarkston and the Southway Bridge, and provides
a southern connection between the Cities of Clarkston and Lewiston.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several alternatives were evaluated as part of the environmental studies conducted for the project. However, only
one build alternative and the no-build are under consideration at present. The build alternative includes a four-lane
roadway on a new location, generally north of 16th Avenue, as described above, and intersecting 15th Street south
of Highland Avenue. It also includes widening 15th Street to three lanes (two travel lanes and a continuous left-turn
lane).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments, have been sent to appropriate Federal, State, and
local agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interest
in the proposal. A series of public meetings were held in Asotin County between January and August 1993. A public hearing
has been scheduled for January 27, 1994. The EA is currently available for review and comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the EA and the proposed action will be accepted until ten days after the public hearing. To ensure that the
full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and any significant issues identified, comments
and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed action
and the EA should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, in cooperation with the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), will prepare a supplement
to the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) on a proposal to construct a new toll bridge across the Carquinez
Strait at Interstate 680 between the City of Benicia and the City of Martinez. The proposed new toll bridge will be parallel
to the existing Benicia-Martinez Bridge. The original DEIS for the Benicia-Martinez Bridge System (FHWA&hyph;CA&hyph;EIS&hyph;91&hyph;03&hyph;D)
was approved October 17, 1991. The proposed improvements will provide a new five-lane bridge, including one auxiliary
lane and one slow-vehicle lane, a new toll plaza and new freeway-to-freeway connectors between I&hyph;680 and I&hyph;780.
These are considered necessary to improve operation and safety, relieve freeway congestion and accommodate projected
traffic volumes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed project limits include I&hyph;680, from 2000 feet south of the Marina Vista Interchange in Contra Costa
County to Bayshore Road in Solano County, and I&hyph;780, from East 5th Street to include the I&hyph;680/I&hyph;780
Interchange in Solano County. The scope of the traffic study includes: (1) I&hyph;680 from Route 4 to I&hyph;80, (2)
I&hyph;780 between I&hyph;680 and I&hyph;80, (3) I&hyph;80 between Red Top Road and the Route 12 East Interchange,
(4) Freeway-to-freeway as well as local interchanges, and (5) Freeway ramp-end and local street intersections potentially
affected by proposed improvements. Modifications to the I&hyph;680/Marina Vista Interchange and the I&hyph;680/I&hyph;780
Interchange will be required, and will be considered in the preliminary engineering and environmental studies.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Draft EIR/EIS for the Benicia-Martinez Bridge System Project was circulated and a public hearing was held in December
1991. One hundred thirty (130) written comments were received. Substantial comments involved: (1) Matching the
scope of the project with the available funding, (2) providing for future rail transit on the new bridge, (3) location
of the new bridge and toll plaza, (4) the direction of toll collection, and (5) construction impacts. Based on this
information the decision was made to down-scope the project to the current proposal and prepare a Supplemental Draft
Environmental Impact Statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives under consideration include: (1) Taking no action, (2) providing for mass transit and (3) providing
for multi-modal transportation modes including bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Incorporated into the studies
with the build alternatives will be design variations of grade and alignment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have interest in
this proposal. A public meeting (open house/map display) will be held to provide information and discuss features
of the project. In addition, a public hearing will be held. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the meeting
and hearing. The Supplemental Draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public
hearing. No formal scoping meeting will be held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues are
identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning
this proposed action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address previously provided in this document.

The FHWA, in cooperation with the Kansas Department of Transportation, Missouri Highway and Transportation Department,
Cass County, and Johnson County will prepare an EIS for a proposed highway project known as the 21st Century Transportation
Corridor. If constructed, the project would be primarily on new location and developed initially as a two-lane road
(ultimately as a four-lane roadway). The study corridor begins at the existing K&hyph;7/Shawnee Mission Parkway
interchange, passes to the east side of DeSoto, extends southerly along the west side of the Cedar Creek development
and the Johnson County Industrial Airport, extends southeasterly to U.S. 169 north of Spring Hill, and then extends
easterly across the southern part of Johnson County passing south of Stilwell and intersecting the State Line in the
vicinity of 195th Street. The corridor will then enter Cass County, Missouri, and connect with Highway 71 south of
Belton; a distance of approximately 74 kilometers (46 miles).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, in cooperation with the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department and Louisiana Department
of Transportation, will prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to construct a four-lane,
divided, fully controlled access highway facility located on new alignment. The proposed project along U.S. 71,
from Texarkana, Arkansas-Texas south to the Louisiana State Line, includes several alternatives based on new location
corridors and varying termini. The approximate length of the project is 53.1 kilometers (33.0 miles).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed improvements would improve the capacity of the existing route and increase regional mobility along
a proposed ultimate route extending from Kansas City, Missouri to Shreveport, Louisiana. This project is one of several
projects identified as ``high priority corridors'' on the National Highway System that would provide a transportation
corridor of national significance from Kansas City to Shreveport. The proposed improvements will draw new traffic
through southwest Arkansas, northwest Louisiana, and northeast Texas and serve as both a short-term and long-term
economic stimulus, promoting development in this currently rural area. Major metropolitan areas lying along this
``high priority corridor'' include Kansas City, Kansas-Missouri; Joplin, Missouri; Fayetteville, Arkansas,
Fort Smith, Arkansas; Texarkana, Arkansas-Texas; and Shreveport, Louisiana.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The northern terminus of the proposed improvements will connect to the proposed Loop 151/245 in Texarkana, Arkansas-Texas.
Loop 151/245 is currently being designed and/or constructed around the south side of Texarkana, Arkansas-Texas.
The southern terminus will be at the Louisiana state line, and its location determined based on existing and new location
U.S. 71 corridors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives to be considered are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The ``Do-Nothing'' Alternative, where roads are constructed according to the regional plan with the exception
of the proposed facility;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The ``Reconstruction'' Alternative, where existing U.S. 71 and roads on the regional plan are upgraded to handle
traffic forecast for the proposed facility, but with less than full control of access; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The ``New Location'' Alternative, considering several different alignments and full control of access.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, state, and local
agencies and to private organizations, including conservation groups and groups of individuals who have expressed
interest in the project in the past, and to major Arkansas, Louisiana and northeast Texas newspapers. A series of public
involvement sessions will be held in the areas to be affected. In addition, a formal public hearing will be held. Public
notice will be given of the time and place of the public involvement sessions and the public hearing. The draft Environmental
Impact Statement (EIS) will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearing. An agency
scoping meeting was held on December 7, 1993 at the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department offices
in Little Rock, Arkansas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA at the address provided above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA, in cooperation with the State of Alabama Department of Transportation, will prepare two Environmental
Impact Statements (EIS's) for Project DPS&hyph;A002(001). The proposal is to construct a multi-lane, limited access
roadway that will function as a major segment of a Memphis to Atlanta transportation corridor. The facility will provide
a direct link between the two metropolitan areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The facility, approximately 273.58 kilometers (170 miles) in length, will be divided into two segments for location
studies and assessment of environmental impacts. Two Environmental Impact Statements will be prepared, one for
the western part of the route, approximately 120.7 kilometer (75 miles) in length, from the Alabama/Mississippi
State line and extending to an undermined point near Interstate Highway 65 near the center of Alabama and the second
Impact Statement written for the eastern part of the project, approximately 152.9 kilometers (95 miles) in length,
beginning at an undetermined point near Interstate Highway 65 near Huntsville, Alabama, and extending to the Alabama/Georgia
border. There will be coordination in the location and environmental studies to establish a common location at I&hyph;65.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State, and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have an interest
in this proposal. A series of public meetings will be held beginning in early 1994. In addition, public hearings will
also be held. Public notice will be given of the time and place of the meetings and hearings. The Draft Environmental
Impact Statements will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the public hearings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) seeks relief from the requirements of &sect;236.566 (49 CFR 236.566) of
the Rules, Standard and Instructions to the extent that they be allowed to operate nonequipped locomotives in automatic
cab signal territory, on the two main tracks between ``CP Jacks,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milepost 191.3 and ``CP Gray,'' milepost 223.3, on the Pittsburgh Line, Harrisburg Division, for the following operations:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Wire trains, work trains, wreck trains, and ballast cleaners to and from work; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Engines used in switching and transfer service, with or without cars, not exceeding 20 miles per hour. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reason given for the proposed changes is that exemptions are already authorized for operation of nonequipped
locomotives under the same circumstances in cab signal territory at other locations on Conrail, and that this relief
request would be an extention of those already existing exemptions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Union Pacific Railroad Company and Missouri Pacific Railroad Company (UP&amp;MP) jointly seek relief from the
requirements of Section 236.590 (49 CFR 236.590) of the Rules, Standard and Instructions for all locomotives owned,
leased, or operated under contract by the UP&amp;MP, equipped with Automatic Train Control Systems (including automatic
train control, automatic train stop, and coded cab signals), to the extent that the carrier be permitted to extend
the current 2 year time limit (736 days) to 3 years, for change out or removal and cleaning of the following pneumatic
valves associated with Automatic Train Control Systems: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. ``EBPS''_Engine Brake Pressure Switch 35/20 PSI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. ``SBPS''_Service Brake Pressure Switch 35/20 PSI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. ATC_Magnet Valve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. CCS_Magnet Valve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicant's justification for relief: To allow easier scheduling of air brake work since time limits would coincide
with other locomotive valves, providing improved inventory control, reducing required inventory, and reducing
locomotive down-time. The carrier also states the failure frequency is less than air brake valves currently changed
and cleaned on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3 year basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested party desiring to protest the granting of an application shall set forth specifically the grounds
upon which the protest is made, and contain a concise statement of the interest of the protestant in the proceeding.
The original and two copies of the protest shall be filed with the Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh
Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 within 45 calendar days of the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuance of this notice. Additionally, one copy of the protest shall be furnished to the applicant at the address listed
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FRA expects to be able to determine these matters without oral hearing. However, if a specific request for an oral hearing
is accompanied by a showing that the party is unable to adequately present his or her position by written statements,
an application may be set for public hearing.

VA published a final regulation amending 38 CFR 4.16(a) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 3, 1990, pages 31579&hyph;80. The amendment provided that marginal employment generally shall be deemed
to exist when a veteran's earned annual income does not exceed the amount established by the Bureau of the Census as
the poverty threshold for one person. VA noted that the weighted average poverty threshold in 1988 for one person (unrelated
individual) as established by the Bureau of the Census was $6,024 and stated we would publish subsequent poverty threshold
figures as notices in the

Pursuant to the provisions of the ``Government in the Sunshine Act'' (5 U.S.C. 552b(e)(2)), notice is hereby given
that at 10:03 a.m. on Tuesday, January 11, 1994, the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
met in closed session to consider matters relating to the Corporation's corporate activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In calling the meeting, the Board determined, on motion of Mr. Stephen R. Steinbrink, acting in the place and stead
of Director Eugene A. Ludwig (Comptroller of the Currency), seconded by Director Jonathan L. Fiechter (Acting Director,
Office of Thrift Supervision), concurred in by Acting Chairman Andrew C. Hove, Jr., that Corporation business required

was practicable; that the public interest did not require consideration of the matters in a meeting open to public
observation; and that the matters could be considered in a closed meeting by authority of subsections (c)(2), (c)(4),
(c)(6), (c)(9)(B), and (c)(10) of the ``Government in the Sunshine Act'' (5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(2), (c)(4), (c)(6), (c)(9)(B),

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed general permit is intended to regulate placer mining activities in the state of Alaska. EPA, Region
10 has issued almost identical individual permits to these facilities in the past and intends to relieve some of the
administrative burden of issuing individual permits by issuing this general permit. When issued, the proposed permit
will establish effluent limitations, standards, prohibitions and other conditions on discharges from the covered
facilities. These conditions are based on existing national effluent guidelines and material contained in the administrative
record. A description of the basis for the conditions and requirements of the proposed general permit is given in the
fact sheet published below.

a. Section 301(a) of the CWA provides that the discharge of pollutants is unlawful except in accordance with a National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. Although such permits have been issued to individual dischargers,
EPA's regulations do authorize the issuance of ``general permits'' to categories of discharges (40 CFR 122.28) when
a number of point sources are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Located within the same geographic area and warrant similar pollution control measures; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Discharge the same types of wastes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Require the same effluent limitations or operating conditions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Require the same or similar monitoring requirements; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) In the opinion of the Director, are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under individual
permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Like individual permits, a violation of a condition contained in a general permit constitutes a violation of the
Act and subjects the owner or operator of the permitted facility to the penalties specified in section 309 of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. A Notice of Intent (NOI) to be covered under this General Permit is required (40 CFR 122.28(b)(2)(i)). The requirements
are outlined in Part I.E. of the permit. An Annual Placer Mining Application would be acceptable if it contains all
the items specified in the permit.

authorized to discharge under the expiring general permit and submit an NOI 90 days prior to the expiration of this
general permit are covered by the continued permit.

Types of Placer Mine Operations Covered by the Permit. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to issue a General NPDES permit for Alaska placer mining operations which are facilities that mine
and process gold placer ores using gravity separation methods to recover the gold metal contained in the ore. This
permit applies to all open-cut and mechanical dredge (not suction dredges) gold placer mines except those open-cut
mines that mine less than 1,500 cubic yards of placer ore per mining season and dredges that remove less than 50,000
cubic yards of placer ore per mining season. These operations are covered by the effluent guidelines and described
in 40 CFR 440.140(b). EPA has completed a literature research project considering the environmental effects of all
suction dredge operation and potential controls that could be placed on them. Based on this research, EPA has concluded
that suction dredges with intake hoses of greater than 4 inches will be covered by this permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operations utilizing hydraulic removal of overburden are covered by this permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This permit does not authorize discharges resulting from beneficiation methods utilizing cyanidation, froth flotation,
heap or vat leaching and mercury amalgamation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many streams and stream reaches in Alaska have been designated as part of the federal wild and scenic rivers system
or as a Conservation System Unit (CSU) by the federal government. Additional conditions may be required by the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game in resident and anadromous fish streams. ``The Atlas to the Catalog of Waters Important
for Spawning, Rearing or Migration of Anadromous Fish'' lists the streams in the State which require a Habitat permit
from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Because this permit does not relieve a permittee of the requirements of
other applicable federal, state or local laws, permittees should contact the appropriate state or federal agencies
to inquire about additional permits that may be required.

Individual Permits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Owners or operators authorized by a general permit may be excepted from coverage by a general permit by applying to
the Director of the NPDES program for an individual permit. This request may be made by submitting an NPDES permit application,
together with supporting documentation for the request no later than 90 days after publication by EPA of the final
general permit in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or 180 days prior to the commencement of operation of a new source or new discharger. The Director may require any person
authorized by a general permit to apply for and obtain an individual permit, or any interested person may petition
the Director to take this action. The Director may consider the issuance of individual permits when:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Placer mining involves the mining and extraction of gold or other heavy metals and minerals primarily from alluvial
deposits. These deposits may be in existing stream beds or ancient often buried stream deposits, i.e. paleo or fossil
placers. Many Alaskan placer deposits consist of unconsolidated clay, sand, gravel, cobble and boulders that contain
very small amounts of native gold or other precious metals. Most are stream deposits and occur along present stream
valleys or on benches or terraces above existing streams. Beach placer deposits have been and continue to be important
producers in Alaska. These deposits, most notable near Nome, include both submerged and elevated beach placer deposits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Essential components of placer mining include overburden removal, mining of the gold placer gravels and processing
(gold recovery). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Overburden Removal. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Various types of overburden include barren alluvial gravels, broken slide rock or glacial deposits. In some parts
of Alaska the pay gravels are overlaid by silty, organic-rich deposits of barren, frozen material generally comprised
of wind-blown particles (loess). Particularly high ice content is common. Most facilities utilize mechanical methods
for removal of overburden because they generally use the same excavating equipment for mining.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Overburden can also be removed by hydraulicking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Hydraulicking consists of the loosening of material by water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 delivered under pressure through a hydraulic giant (monitor). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The material then flows, usually by gravity, to the sluice box if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 overburden is to be processed with the mineral bearing material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 below. Overburden consisting of barren material may be directed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 away from the sluice box so that only mineral bearing material is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 processed in the sluice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mining Methods. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Placer mining methods range from dredging systems to open-cut mining. Dredging systems are classified as hydraulic
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanical, depending on the methods of digging. A floating dredge consists of a supporting hull with a mining control
system, excavating and lifting mechanism, gold recovery circuits, and waste disposal system. They are all designed
to work as a unit to dig, classify, beneficiate ores and dispose of waste. Suction dredges, the most common hydraulic
dredging system, are quite popular in Alaska with the small or recreational gold placer miner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A bucket-line dredge has been the traditional gold placer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 mechanical dredging tool in Alaska. Excavation equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 consists of a chain of buckets, traveling continuously around a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 truss or plate-girder ladder, that scoop up a load as they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 forced against the mining face while pivoting around the lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 tumbler and then dump as they pivot around the upper tumbler. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The ladder is raised or lowered as required by a large hoisting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 winch through a system of cables and sheaves. About six placer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 miners operate bucket-line dredges in Alaska. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Processing Methods. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A large percentage of the present gold placer mining operations use some type of sluice box to perform the primary processing
function, beneficiation. An increasing number of jig plants are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also being used. Many operations make use of feed size classification which involves the physical separation of large
rocks and boulders from smaller materials such as gravel and sand. The object of classification is to prevent the processing
of large-sized material which is unlikely to contain gold values. Commonly used classification equipment includes:
grizzlies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trommels and static or vibrating screens. The most common gold recovery method is sluicing. A sluice is a long, sloped
trough into which water is directed to effectuate separation of gold from ore. A slurry of water and ore flows down the
sluice and the gold, due to its relatively high density, is trapped in riffles along the sluice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Suction Dredging. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A suction dredge is a mechanical device which floats on the stream surface and which pumps stream water and stream bed
material through a suction intake conduit to a sluice box from which gold or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other minerals may be recovered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The discharge from suction dredges consists totally of stream water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and bed material. These discharges are becoming numerous in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state. The discharge limits and monitoring requirements are identical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the majority of these discharges. This category of discharges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets the qualifications of 40 CFR 122.59 for the issuance of General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discharge Permits. This general discharge permit will expedite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing the numerous applications and provide the same regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls over the discharges as an individual permit would. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Effluent Characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Discharges from placer mining operations consist of water and the naturally occurring materials found in the alluvial
deposits (e.g. sand, silt, clay, trace minerals and metals, etc.). Some of the elements measured in placer mine effluent
are derived principally from sulfide, oxide, carbonate, and silicate mineral species, and include antimony, arsenic,
cadmium, copper, iron, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, and zinc. Most of these parameters are found in trace amounts
and are of little significance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on review of sampling data collected by EPA and upon evaluation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Alaska Water Quality Standards (WQS), EPA has concluded that the pollutants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of primary concern are settleable solids, turbidity, and arsenic. Arsenic is the only toxic pollutant of concern
due to its naturally occurring abundance in most Alaskan soils. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

III. Basis for Effluent Limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Effluent limits required in this permit for the control of pollutants are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 published in 40 CFR part 440, Subpart M_Gold Placer Mine Subcategory, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 was promulgated May 24, 1988, in 53 FR 18764. Additional information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 regarding the basis for establishing the effluent limits is summarized in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 EPA publication titled ``Development Document for Effluent Limitations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards for the Ore Mining and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Dressing Point Source Category_Gold Placer Mine Subcategory'' (May 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule establishes effluent limitations guidelines and standards based on the best practicable control
technology currently available (BPT), the best available technology economically achievable (BAT), and new source

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 performance standards (NSPS) based on the best available demonstrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 technology. The BAT and NSPS limitations represent the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 technology required to be in place for all placer mining operations covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 under 40 CFR part 440, subpart M.

Section 402(o) of the Act stipulates that NPDES permits may not be reissued to contain effluent limitations that are
less stringent than comparable water quality standards and technology based effluent limitations in the previous
permit. EPA has determined that this general permit complies with these anti-backsliding provisions of the Act.

Mechanical Operations. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CWA requires industries to apply treatment technology representing BAT that is economically achievable. The
BAT 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements specify the use of settling ponds plus total recirculation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process wastewater as the selected treatment technology. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulation does allow the discharge of incidental waters (including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters that enter a mine through precipitation, snow melt, drainage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water, ground water infiltration and the melting of permafrost) which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have commingled with process waters, provided that these incidental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters are in excess of the make-up water required, are treated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settling ponds and do not exceed 0.2 ml/l settleable solids prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of this permit, discharged wastewater consists of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidental waters commingled with process waters used to move the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ore to and through the beneficiation process, water used to aid in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classification, and water used in gravity separation. Pursuant to 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 440.143, BAT requirements are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The concentration of settleable solids in wastewater discharged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from an open-cut mine plant or a dredge plant site must not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed an instantaneous maximum of 0.2 ml/l. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The volume of wastewater which may be discharged from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
open-cut mine plant or dredge plant site must not exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume of infiltration, drainage and mine drainage waters which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in excess of the make-up water required for operation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiation process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These technology-based requirements are specified in Parts II.A.1.a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and b. of the proposed permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect of requirement II.A.2. of the proposed permit is to prohibit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the discharge of any wastewater during periods when new water is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed to enter the plant site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Water Quality Based Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the BAT effluent limitations, the permit includes effluent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitations which are required to ensure compliance with WQS (Alaska 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations 18 AAC 70). These standards vary with the beneficial use they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are established to protect. In water bodies with more than one designated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficial use, the more restrictive criteria apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WQS protect most fresh water sources for use in drinking, agriculture, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aquaculture and industrial water supply, contact and secondary recreation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the growth and propagation of fish, shellfish, and other aquatic life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Alaska Regulations 18 AAC 70.050). All permits being issued in this round 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of permitting must protect for all the above uses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has concluded, based on review of the WQS and available sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data, that the parameters of turbidity and arsenic must be limited in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the State WQS. Also, the sediment standard must be applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharges from operations utilizing the hydraulic removal of overburden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The arsenic, turbidity and sediment limits were established pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 301(b)(1)(C) of the CWA, which requires imposition of ``*&blank;*&blank;* any more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent limitation, including those necessary to meet water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards, *&blank;*&blank;* or required to implement any applicable water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard established pursuant to this Act.'' The NPDES regulations, at 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 122.44(d), require NPDES permits to include conditions to ``Achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality standards established under section 303 of CWA 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
*&blank;*&blank;*.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Turbidity: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Mechanical and Hydraulic Removal of Overburden According to the WQS, the most restrictive turbidity criteria
applies to fresh water sources classified for water contact recreation uses. These criteria (18 AAC 70.020(b)(1)(B)(i)(4))
state that turbidity *&blank;*&blank;* ``Shall not exceed 5 NTU above natural conditions when the natural turbidity
is 50 NTU or less; and more than 10% increase in turbidity when the natural condition is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 50 NTU, not to exceed a maximum increase of 15 NTU.'' The proposed draft permit contains a turbidity limit that
would assure compliance with water quality standards under worst case conditions. That is, the turbidity in the effluent
must not exceed 5 NTUs above the background turbidity level in the receiving stream. This condition accounts for naturally
occurring turbidity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the receiving water and allows the effluent to contain an additional 5 NTUs of turbidity where the receiving water
is naturally turbid. The permit condition does not account for those situations where naturally occurring turbidity
would allow an increase of up to 15 NTUs, nor does it account for the dilution effects of the receiving stream. The reason
for assuming worst 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case conditions is that EPA does not have current site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to establish end-of-pipe limitations for each of the permits being processed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although worst case conditions are assumed in the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
draft permit, EPA will consider modifying the NTU limitation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account for the dilution effects of the receiving stream. EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach in setting higher turbidity limitations is dependent upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of the NOI with information from the permittee or from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alaska Department of Natural Resources (ADNR) acting on behalf 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the permittee demonstrating that the dilution effect of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receiving water justifies a less stringent limit. EPA is operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the assumption that the permit applicant bears the burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of providing information necessary to issue the permit (40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
124.85(a)(1)). Where the applicant does not provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site-specific information that would justify a less stringent turbidity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit, the permit issued to a site will contain the turbidity limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the draft permit.

The procedures used to calculate a higher turbidity limit are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 same as those used in the placer mining permits issued since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 1986. The turbidity limit is based on utilizing a mass balance

 equation which relates upstream receiving water flow and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 turbidity to effluent flow and turbidity. The basic form of this

 The information that must be submitted by the permittee to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 determine the appropriate turbidity limit for the facility is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 effluent and receiving stream flow rates. The receiving stream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 flow rate must be measured upstream from the discharge point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 and downstream from any diversions. Receiving stream flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 values can be obtained from the ADNR, Division of Mining, upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 request by the permittee. ADNR methodology for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 upstream flow uses equations developed by Ashton and Carlson 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1984). The maximum effluent discharge flow must be estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 by the permittee and must account for the effects of all excess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 incidental waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permittees requesting a higher turbidity limitation must submit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 necessary information to EPA with the NOI. This applies to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 permittees, including those who have submitted this type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 information in the past, in order to assure that all site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 information is up-to-date.

Suction Dredging.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The daily visual inspection during operation of an area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 downstream of the suction dredge is based on research 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 published in the scientific literature (Griffith and Andrews 1981, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Hassler et al. 1986, Harvey 1986, Huber and Blanchet 1992, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Thomas 1985) and on monitoring done by Alaska Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Environmental Conservation (ADEC) (Ron McAlister, ADEC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 personal communication). In most cases, water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 recovered rapidly below the dredge. ADEC found that turbidity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 was elevated 1 to 4.5 NTU 500 feet downstream of an operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 10 inch dredge. The daily visual inspection during operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 should assure that the water quality standard for turbidity is met.

Arsenic_Mechanical and Hydraulic Removal of Overburden. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has concluded, based on available sampling data, that arsenic is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 commonly associated with placer mining wastes. Locally, it is the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 abundant toxic metal present. For this reason, EPA has determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 that arsenic is a pollutant of concern. Additionally, although several studies by EPA have indicated a reduction
in levels of arsenic in placer mining effluent as a result of reducing settleable solids to 0.2 ml/l, EPA has concluded
that these reduced levels of arsenic are not consistently adequate to achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 WQS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In establishing the arsenic limit, the ``Amendments to the Water Quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Standards Regulation; Compliance with CWA section 303(c)(2)(B); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Final Rule'' (57 FR 6084, Tuesday, December 22, 1992) are used. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 rulemaking promulgated the chemical-specific numeric criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 priority toxic pollutants necessary to bring all States into compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 with the requirements of the CWA section 303(c)(2)(B). The primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 focus of the rule is the inclusion of the federal water quality criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 pollutant(s) in State standards as necessary to support water quality-based control programs (e.g. NPDES permits).
The federal standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of 0.18 &mu;g/l total recoverable arsenic is applicable to Alaska and this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 number has been used to derive the end-of-pipe limitation for the draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mixing zones are allowed under the Alaska standards for some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 pollutant discharges. However, 18 AAC 70.032(a) states *&blank;*&blank;* ``In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 applying the water quality criteria set out in this chapter, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 department will, upon application and in its discretion, prescribe in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 permits or certifications a volume of dilution for an effluent or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 substance within a receiving water unless pollutants discharged could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 bioaccumulate; concentrate or persist in the environment; cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic effects; or otherwise present a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 risk to human health *&blank;*&blank;*'' Arsenic is a carcinogen. In a letter, dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 March 24, 1992, from the Alaska Department of Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Conservation Commissioner, John Sandor, to EPA Water Division 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Director, Charles Findley, the State has interpreted this to mean that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ``*&blank;*&blank;* a mixing zone may be prescribed where there is no reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 expectation of an adverse effect on human health or aquatic life, based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 on site-specific, chemical, physical and biological characteristics.'' EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 is not proposing a mixing zone for arsenic but would include a method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 for determining a mixing zone in the permit if the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 determines that such a mixing zone is appropriate and is in compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 with WQS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two options are given to the permittee to determine the arsenic limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 If the ``natural'' background is not measured, the effluent limit is set 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 according to federal standard at 0.18
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
 &mu;g/l. The other option depends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 on the ``natural'' background levels of arsenic present in the receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 water. The ``natural'' background is defined as the total recoverable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 arsenic level upstream from all mining and other man-made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 disturbances. The WQS, 18 AC 70.010(a), states that ``[n]o person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 may conduct an operation that *&blank;*&blank;* contributes to a violation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 water quality standards *&blank;*&blank;*'' If the ``natural'' background levels are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 already above the federal standard, any discharge at or below the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ``natural'' background level will not elevate the existing concentrations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the stream thus not contributing further to a violation of WQS. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ``natural'' background data must be provided with the annual Discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Monitoring Report (DMR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the effluent limitation of 0.18 &mu;g/L is not quantifiable using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 EPA approved analytical method (206.2), EPA has set a reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 threshold to measure the highest acceptable quantification level for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 parameter. When results cannot be quantified, values below the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 method detection level (1 &mu;g/L) shall be report as zero and values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 above the method detection level but below the minimum level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4 &mu;g/L) reported at 1/2 the minimum level or 2 &mu;g/L. This reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 threshold does not authorize the discharge of this parameter in excess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of the effluent limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Sediment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The sediment standard (18 ACC 70.020) is a narrative standard which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 reads, ``No increase in concentration of sediment, including settleable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 solids, above natural conditions.'' The method indicated for measuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 sediments is the use of an Imhoff cone. The detection limit, the lowest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 measurable value, of an Imhoff cone is 0.2 ml/l. Therefore the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 maximum limit for sediment will be 0.2 ml/l measured as settleable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 solids for operations utilizing hydraulic removal of overburden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Basis for Monitoring and Reporting Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Monitoring:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All self-monitoring requirements considered the remoteness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the mining operations, the magnitude of the pollutants discharged, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 practicability of maintaining a valid quality assurance program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The measurement of settleable solids is an indication of overall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 treatment efficiency. The permit requires monitoring for settleable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 solids once per day during periods of discharge. If there is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 discharge to waters of the United States, permittees are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 sample for settleable solids on a daily basis, even if sluicing does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 occur. This is required because the operator is responsible at all times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 for the condition of the wastewater entering the receiving stream. Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the results from settleable solids sampling can give the operator an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 immediate indication of the overall effectiveness of the treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 system and thus allow advanced planning for treatment system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. EPA has concluded that the monitoring frequency for turbidity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 arsenic will be once per season. Monitoring for these pollutants have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 been established at less frequent intervals because sampling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 analysis for these parameters are more difficult and costly. Samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 for monitoring purposes must be taken during sluicing or discharge at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 a time when the operation has reached equilibrium. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 samples should be taken when sluice paydirt loading and effluent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 discharge are fairly constant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Effluent flow monitoring is also required in the proposed permit. The purpose of this requirement is to assess the
pollutant loading discharged into the receiving water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The visual inspection provision in Part II.D.1. of the proposed permit is required to assure against discharges
resulting from structural failure of berms, dikes, dams and other water control structures. A visual inspection
is an effective tool for assuring proper operation and maintenance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Monitoring provisions for turbidity, arsenic, settleable solids, and flow (in Parts II.D.1.c., d., e., and f.,
respectively) are included in the proposed permit. These provisions are included to explain how, when, and where
to collect these samples.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Reporting of effluent violations is required in writing within a reasonable time period. This is found in Permit
Part IV.G.2.c. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Reporting of visual violations from suction dredges is required in writing within a reasonable time period. This
is found in Permit Part II.D.2.b. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The results of all monitoring or notice of no discharge must be reported to EPA by November 30 of each year. This is
found in Permit Part IV.B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Best Management Practices (BMPs) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Mechanical and Hydraulic Removal of Overburden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. BMP conditions in Permit Parts III.A.1. to III.A.5. of the proposed permit were developed pursuant to section 304(e)
of the CWA. These BMPs are established in 40 CFR 440.148 and are necessary for control and treatment of the drainage
and infiltration water at gold placer mines and to prevent solids and toxic metals from being released to the receiving
streams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The intent of Permit Part III.A.1. is to avoid contamination of nonprocess water, reduce the volume of water requiring
treatment and maximize the retention time and the settling capacity of the settling ponds. The diversion must totally
circumvent any gold recovery units, treatment facilities, etc. Any mine drainage sources that pass through the actual
mining area and are subject to transporting pollutants must be treated prior to discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Permit Part III.A.2. is required to assure that water retention devices are constructed appropriately. This may
be achieved by utilizing on-site material in a manner that the fine sealing material (such as clays) are mixed in the
berms with coarser materials. Berms should be toed into the underlying earth, constructed in layers or lifts and each
layer thoroughly compacted to ensure mechanical and watertight integrity of the berms. Other impermeable material
such as plastic sheets or membranes may be used inside the berms when sealing fines are unavailable or in short supply.
The side slope of berms should not be greater than the natural angle of repose of the materials used in the berms or a slope
of 2:1, whichever is flatter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The intent of Permit Part III.A.3 is to ensure that the investment in pollution control pay the maximum benefit in
terms of reduced pollutant volumes reaching water of the United States. These measures may include location of the
storage ponds and storage areas to assure that they will not be washed out by reasonably predictable flooding or by
the return of a relocated stream to it original stream bed. Materials removed from settling ponds should be placed
in bermed areas where liquids from the materials cannot flow overland to waters of the United States. It may be necessary,
in some cases, to collect such liquids and pump or divert them back to the settling pond for treatment. This requirement
applies both during the active mining season and at all other times until reclamation is completed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Permit Part III.A.4. is required to assure that the amount of wastewater that is discharged is kept to a minimum.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The provisions of Permit Part III.A.5. will ensure that water control devices are adequately maintained. This
specifies that structures should be inspected on a regular basis for any signs of structural weakness or incipient
failure. Whenever such weakness or incipient failure becomes evident, repair or augmentation of the structure to
reasonably ensure against catastrophic failure shall be made immediately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. BMP condition Permit Part III.A.6. of the proposed permit is required pursuant to 40 CFR 122.44(k)(3). The purpose
of this requirement is to assure that all reasonable measures are taken to decrease the amount of pollutants being
discharged to waters of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The same BMPs are required of operations utilizing hydraulic removal of overburden pursuant to 40 CFR 122.44(k)(3).
The purpose of these requirements is to assure that reasonable measures are taken to decrease the amount of pollutants
being discharged to waters of the United States.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Suction Dredging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The BMPs are required pursuant to 40 CFR 122.44(k)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Dredging is permitted only in the active stream channel where the dredging spoils are relatively clean and will
cause minimum turbidity when returned to the stream. The material that runs through a suction dredge flows downstream
and settles among gravel and rocks in the streambed. Too much silt and sand make it difficult for the salmon to dig suitable
gravel nests (redds) and can also smother fish eggs already deposited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Wherever practicable, the dredge shall be set to discharge into a quiet pool where settling of dredge spoils can
occur more rapidly. This will cause in-stream turbidity to be minimized and localized to the general area of the dredging
activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The purpose of this requirement is to control the potential discharge of pollutants, resulting from fuel spills,
from entering receiving waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Dredging is not permitted during the periods that fish eggs could be in the gravel at the dredge site. The greatest
single effect a suction dredge has on the environment is the danger it poses to fish. The dredge pump forces water and
gravel through the nozzle and hose. Fish eggs taken up with gravel cannot survive the shock, pressure, and battering
and pounding that comes with moving through the hose and sluice. If a fish egg should somehow survive the hose and sluice,
the chances for being buried in the gravel at the right depth and in the correct gravel composition necessary for incubation
are nonexistent. ``The Atlas to the Catalog of Waters Important for Spawning, Rearing or Migration of Anadromous
Fish'' lists the streams in the State which require a Habitat permit from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. This
catalog is quite extensive but is available for viewing at many agencies including Alaska Department of Fish and Game,
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Anchorage Operations Office of EPA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part III.C. of the proposed permit was established in accordance with 40 CFR 122.44(k)(3). The purpose of this requirement

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A species list was provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the state of Alaska. The recommended protection
measures for the species of concern during the nesting period prohibits alterations of limited, high quality habitat
which could detrimentally and significantly reduce prey availability. Since this general water discharge permit
is written to protect aquatic life or human health criteria (whichever is more stringent), no alterations of habitat
due to water discharges authorized by this permit should occur. Because of this, EPA has determined that formal consultation
for section 7 of the Endangered Species Act is not necessary for existing facilities. Environmental Assessments
will be completed for each new source discharge as is stated in Part I.A.3. of the permit. Any consultation necessary
to comply with the Endangered Species Act will be performed at this time.

VII. Storm Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part III.D. of the proposed permit establishes a storm exemption provision which authorizes exceedences of technology-based
effluent limitations and standards provided that the permittee meets certain design and operational criteria.
This provision is required pursuant to 40 CFR 440.141(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This provision allows for the unavoidable exceedence of technology-based effluent limitations during storms of
intensity greater than or equal to a 5-year, 6-hour storm event. The storm exemption will be allowed provided that
(1) the settling ponds are designed, constructed, and maintained to contain the volume of process water generated
during four hours of normal operation plus the drainage water resulting from a 5-year, 6-hour storm event, (2) the
operator takes all reasonable steps possible to maintain treatment of the wastewater and minimize overflow from
the settling ponds, (3) the permittee must be in compliance with the BMPs in Part III.A. of the proposed permit, and
(4) the operator complies with all the notification requirements for bypasses and upsets as established in Parts
III.G. and H. of the proposed permit. Part III.D. of the proposed permit establishes the specific conditions which
must be met in order to be eligible for the storm exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption is designed to provide an affirmative defense to an enforcement action. Therefore, the operator has
the burden of demonstrating to the appropriate authority that the above conditions have been met.

A. Part I.C. has been incorporated into the proposed permit to further clarify the discharges that will be authorized
under this permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Part II.A.2. of the proposed permit is required to assure compliance with the technology-based requirements established
in Part II.A.1.a. of the proposed permit.

IX. New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 301 of the CWA, NSPS (40 CFR 440.144) were promulgated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 for gold placer mine facilities. NSPS apply to new mines determined to be new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 sources by virtue of their activities occurring after promulgation of the rule (May 24, 1988). The NSPS for gold placer
mining facilities are based on the same treatment technology as BAT, which consists of simple settling plus recirculation
of all process water. Since BAT is based on the most stringent demonstrated technology that is available for treating
gold placer mine wastewater, those mines which are new sources will not be subject to controls more stringent than
those applicable to existing mines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 511(c)(1) of the CWA, NPDES permits for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 sources are subject to the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (NEPA). NEPA requires that, prior to the issuance of an NPDES permit to a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 source facility, an Environmental Assessment (EA) must be prepared to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the potential for any significant impacts on the quality of the human environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 resulting from operation of the new source. Permit part I.E.1. requires that new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 facilities submit a notice of intent by January 1 of the year of discharge. This will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 allow adequate time to complete EAs for each new source prior to the mining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 season. If the EA indicates that significant adverse environmental impacts may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 occur, then the applicant must prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 However, if the EA indicates that significant impacts are not anticipated, a Finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of No Significant Impact (FNSI) shall be issued and the facility will be covered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the existing general permit. The FNSI may be based, in part, on required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 permit conditions or mitigation measures necessary to make the recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 alternative environmentally acceptable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

X. State Certification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 301(b)(1)(C) of the Act requires that an NPDES permit contain conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 which ensure compliance with applicable State water quality standards or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 limitations. The limitations for turbidity and arsenic were established pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 WQS and federal standards, respectively. Section 401 requires that States certify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 that Federally issued permits are in compliance with State law. No permits can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 issued until the requirements of Section 401 are satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These are permits for operations discharging to waters (inland waters) of the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of Alaska. EPA is requesting State officials to review and provide appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 certification to these draft permits pursuant to 40 CFR 124.53.

To all interested government agencies, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 public groups, and individuals: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 procedures for complying with the National Environmental Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Act (NEPA), 40 CFR part 6, subpart F, EPA has completed an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 environmental review of the following proposed action: Issuance of a General National Pollutant Discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Elimination System (NPDES) Permit No. AK&hyph;G&hyph;37&hyph;0000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 for Alaskan Placer Miners.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed action is issuance of a General NPDES Permit covering both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing and new source facilities in Alaska which mine and process, using gravity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separation methods, gold placer ores. The proposed effluent limitations, monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions, and other conditions are specified in the draft General NPDES permit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fact Sheet, accompanying the draft permit, describes the basis for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. The proposed General NPDES Permit would replace the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual NPDES permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An environmental assessment (EA) of this proposed action has been completed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(enclosed). Based on the EA, and in accordance with the guidelines for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the significance of proposed federal actions (40 CFR 1508.27) and EPA criteria for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiating an environmental impact statement (EIS) (40 CFR 6.605), EPA has concluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the proposed General NPDES permit will not result in a significant effect on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human environment. The proposed permit will not significantly affect land use patterns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or population, wetlands or floodplains, threatened or endangered species, farmlands, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ecologically critical areas, historic resources, air quality, water quality, noise levels, fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and wildlife resources, nor will it conflict with local, regional, or state land use plans or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policies. The proposed permit conforms with all applicable federal statutes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
executive orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed General Permit includes the same technology-based permit limits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by regulation (40 CFR part 440, subpart M), as the individual permits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently do. The recirculation of process wastewater is required and the settleable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solids concentration of the allowable discharge (i.e. excess water) is limited to 0.2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
milliliters per liter. Water quality-based limits are also included in the proposed permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed permit covers, in addition to conventional open-cut placer mining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations, placer mining operations utilizing hydraulic methods to remove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overburden, and suction dredges. The proposed permit limits for the hydraulic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overburden removal operations are based on the state sediment standard and best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional judgment and are the same as the limits for the conventional operations. The limits for the suction dredge
operations would be based on best professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed General Permit would reduce the yearly administrative burden of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA associated with the processing of numerous individual permits. Because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed General Permit and individual permits include essentially the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, the primary impact related to permit type is expected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative. No negative impacts to EPA, other agencies or operators are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed General NPDES Permit may contribute to an improvement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental conditions because it would reduce the permitting administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workload thus making available limited time that could be used for higher priority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, such as permit compliance and inspections. The inclusion of suction dredge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations in the General Permit will improve the monitoring and compliance of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed action, the new source placer mining proposals requesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage under the General Permit would continue to be subject to individual NEPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviews. This will enable EPA to evaluate the site-specific and cumulative impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the individual projects. Where an EA concludes that significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts are not anticipated, a Finding of No Significant Impact would be issued and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the new source project would be granted coverage under the General Permit. If EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determines that significant impacts from a proposed new source project may occur, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EIS would be prepared prior to EPA's final permit decision. Therefore the site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of those projects would continue to be evaluated and considered prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit actions. An individual permit may also be required by EPA in lieu of coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the General Permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the above reasons EPA has determined that an EIS will not be prepared for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments pertaining to this Finding of No Significant Impact may be submitted to: Rick Seaborne, Environmental Protection
Agency, Environmental Review Section, 1200 Sixth Avenue, WD&hyph;126, Seattle, WA 98101. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No administrative action will be taken for at least 30 days after the release of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finding of No Significant Impact. EPA will fully consider all comments before taking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many streams and stream reaches in Alaska have been designated as part of the federal wild and scenic rivers system
or as Conservation System Units (CSUs) by the federal government. Permittees should contact the district offices
of the federal agencies that administer the designated area for additional restrictions that may apply to operating
within the area. Many streams in Alaska where placer mining occurs have been designated by Alaska Department of Fish
and Game (ADFG) as needing an ADFG Habitat permit with additional restrictions. ``The Atlas to the Catalog of Waters
Important for Spawning, Rearing or Migration of Anadromous Fish'' lists the streams in the State which require a Habitat
permit.

b. Visual Inspection. The Permittee shall institute a comprehensive visual inspection program to facilitate proper
operation and maintenance of the recycle system and the wastewater treatment system. The Permittee shall conduct
an inspection of the site once per day during the mining season. The Permittee shall maintain records of all information
resulting from any visual inspections. These records shall include, but are not limited to, an evaluation of the condition
of all water control devices such as diversion structures and berms and all solids retention structures such as berms,
dikes, pond structures, and dams. The records shall also include an assessment of the presence of sediment buildup
within the settling ponds. The Permittee shall examine all ponds for the occurrence of short circuiting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Turbidity Monitoring. The Permittee shall monitor the turbidity values of the effluent stream and the background
turbidity values of the receiving stream then compare the two samples. The sample results shall be reported on the
Annual Discharge Monitoring Report (DMR). The Permittee shall take one sample at a point that is representative of
the discharge prior to entering the receiving stream. The Permittee shall take another sample above the discharge
point at a location that is considered to be the ``natural'' background of the receiving stream as defined in permit
part V.I. Both samples shall be taken within a reasonable time frame. Monitoring shall be conducted in accordance
with accepted analytical procedures. See attachment 1 for sampling protocol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Arsenic Monitoring. Arsenic samples shall be representative of the discharge and shall be taken at a point prior
to entering the receiving stream. Arsenic samples taken to determine ``natural'' background shall be representative
of the receiving water upstream from any man-made disturbances. Monitoring shall be conducted in accordance with
accepted analytical procedures. The Permittee shall report the sample results on the Annual DMR. See attachment
2 for sampling protocol.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The effluent limitation for total recoverable arsenic is not quantifiable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 using the EPA approved analytical method, EPA method 206.2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, EPA has set forth reporting thresholds to measure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 highest acceptable quantification level for this parameter. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 reporting threshold does not authorize the discharge of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 parameter in excess of the effluent limitation. For more information, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 see special conditions in Part IX. of this permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Settleable Solids Monitoring. Settleable solids samples shall be representative of the discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 and shall be taken at a point prior to entering the receiving stream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Monitoring shall be conducted in accordance with accepted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 analytical procedures (Standard Methods, 16th Edition, 1985). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Permittee shall report the sample results on the Annual DMR. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 attachment 3 for sampling and analysis protocol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Flow Monitoring. Effluent flow shall be measured at the discharge prior to entering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the receiving water. Effluent flow shall be measured at least once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 per day, for continuous discharges, or once during each discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 event if discharges are intermittent. The flow shall be measured in

1. The flow of surface waters (i.e., creek, river, or stream) into the plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 site shall be interrupted and these waters diverted around and away to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 prevent incursion into the plant site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Berms, including any pond walls, dikes, low dams, and similar water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 retention structures shall be constructed in a manner such that they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 reasonably expected to reject the passage of water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Measures shall be taken to assure that pollutant materials removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 from the process water and wastewater streams will be retained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 storage areas and not discharged or released to the waters of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The amount of new water allowed to enter the plant site for use in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 material processing shall be limited to the minimum amount required as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 makeup water for processing operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The permittee may qualify for a storm exemption from the technology-based effluent limitations in Part II.A.1.b.
of this NPDES general permit if the following conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The treatment system is designed, constructed and maintained to contain the maximum volume of untreated process
wastewater which would be discharged, stored, contained and used or recycled by the beneficiation process into the
treatment system during a 4-hour operating period without an increase in volume from precipitation or infiltration,
plus the maximum volume of water runoff (drainage waters) resulting from a 5-year, 6-hour precipitation event. In
computing the maximum volume of water which would result from a 5-year, 6-hour precipitation event, the operator
must include the volume which should result from the plant site contributing runoff to the individual treatment facility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The operator takes all reasonable steps to maintain treatment of the wastewater and minimize the amount of overflow.

A. Representative Sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All samples for monitoring purposes shall be representative of the monitored activity, 40 CFR 122.41 (j). To determine
compliance with permit effluent limitations, ``grab'' samples shall be taken as established under Part II.D. of
this permit. Specifically, effluent samples for settleable solids, turbidity, and arsenic shall be collected from
the settling pond or other treatment systems outlet prior to discharge to the receiving stream. Additionally, turbidity
samples shall also be taken above the discharge point at a location that is representative of the receiving stream.
Samples for arsenic and turbidity monitoring must be taken during sluicing at a time when the operation has reached
equilibrium. For example, samples should be taken when sluice paydirt loading and effluent discharge are constant.

The permittee shall at all times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of treatment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or used by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions of this permit. Proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 operation and maintenance also includes adequate laboratory controls and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 appropriate quality assurance procedures. This provision requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 operation of back-up or auxiliary facilities or similar systems which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 installed by a permittee only when the operation is necessary to achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Bypass of Treatment Facilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Bypass not exceeding limitations. The permittee may allow any bypass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 to occur which does not cause effluent limitations to be exceeded, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 3 of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Notice: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Anticipated bypass. If the permittee knows in advance of the need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice, if possible at least 10 days 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 before the date of the bypass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Unanticipated bypass. The permittee shall submit notice of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 unanticipated bypass as required under Part III.G., Notice of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Noncompliance Reporting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Prohibition of bypass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Bypass is prohibited and the Director or ADEC may take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 enforcement action against a permittee for a bypass, unless: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 injury, or severe property damage; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 equipment should have been installed in the exercise of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 preventive maintenance; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The permittee submitted notices as required under paragraph 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The Director and ADEC may approve an anticipated bypass, after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 considering its adverse effects, if the Director and ADEC determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 that it will meet the three conditions listed above in paragraph 3.a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Upset Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Effect of an upset. An upset constitutes an affirmative defense to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 action brought for noncompliance with such technology based permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 effluent limitations if the requirements of paragraph 2 of this section are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 met. An administrative review of a claim that noncompliance was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 caused by an upset does not represent final administrative action for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 any specific event. A determination is not final until formal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 administrative action is taken for the specific violation(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. A permittee who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 relevant evidence that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. An upset occurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 of the upset; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The permittee submitted notice of the upset as required under Part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 IV.G., Notice of Noncompliance Reporting; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The permittee complied with any remedial measures required under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Part V.D., Duty to Mitigate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the permittee seeking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 to establish the occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Toxic Pollutants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The permittee shall comply with effluent standards or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 prohibitions established under section 307(a) of the Act for toxic pollutants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 within the time provided in the regulations that establish those standards or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 prohibitions, even if the permit has not yet been modified to incorporate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Changes in Discharge of Toxic Substances
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notification shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 provided to the Director and ADEC as soon as the permittee knows of, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 has reason to believe: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. That any activity has occurred or will occur which would result in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 discharge, on a routine or frequent basis, of any toxic pollutant which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 not limited in the permit, if that discharge will exceed the highest of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 40 CFR 122.44(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. That any activity has occurred or will occur which would result in any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 discharge, on a non-routine or infrequent basis, of a toxic pollutant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 which is not limited in the permit, if that discharge will exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 highest of the following ``notification levels'': 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Five hundred micrograms per liter (500 &mu;g/l); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The level established by the Director in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 40 CFR 122.44(f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Planned Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The permittee shall give notice to the Director and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ADEC as soon as possible of any planned physical alterations or additions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 to the permitted facility. Notice is required only when: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The alteration or addition to a permitted facility may meet one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 criteria for determining whether a facility is a new source as determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 in 40 CFR 122.29(b); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The alteration or addition could significantly change the nature or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 increase the quantity of pollutants discharged. This notification applies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 to pollutants which are subject neither to effluent limitations in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This permit may be modified, revoked and reissued, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the permittee for a permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 modification, revocation and reissuance, or termination, or a notification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 planned changes or anticipated noncompliance, does not stay any permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The permittee shall furnish to the Director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 and ADEC, within a reasonable time, any information which the Director or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ADEC may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 revoking and reissuing, or terminating this permit, or to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 compliance with this permit. The permittee shall also furnish to the Director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 or ADEC, upon request, copies of records required to be kept by this

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications, reports or information submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 to the Director and ADEC shall be signed and certified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. All permit applications shall be signed as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. For a corporation: by a responsible corporate officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. For a partnership or sole proprietorship: by a general partner or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the proprietor, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. For a municipality, state, federal, or other public agency: by either 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 a principal executive officer or ranking elected official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. All reports required by the permit and other information requested by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the Director or ADEC shall be signed by a person described above or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 by a duly authorized representative of that person. A person is a duly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 authorized representative only if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The authorization is made in writing by a person described above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 and submitted to the Director and ADEC, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The authorization specified either an individual or a position having 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 responsibility for the overall operation of the regulated facility or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 activity, such as the position of plant manager, operator of a well or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 a well field, superintendent, position of equivalent responsibility, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 an individual or position having overall responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 environmental matters for the company. (A duly authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 representative may thus be either a named individual or any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 individual occupying a named position.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Changes to authorization. If an authorization under paragraph IV.H.2. is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 no longer accurate because a different individual or position has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, a new authorization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 satisfying the requirements of paragraph VI.H.2. must be submitted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the Director and ADEC prior to or together with any reports, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 information, or applications to be signed by an authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. For purpose of reporting, the permittee shall use the reporting threshold equivalent to the minimum level (ML).
The ML is defined as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 concentration in a sample equivalent to the concentration of the lowest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 calibration standard analyzed in a specific analytical procedure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 assuming that all the method-specified sample weights, volumes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 processing steps have been followed. As such, the permittee must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 utilize a standards equivalent to the concentration of the ML for arsenic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 which is 4 &mu;g/L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. For the purpose of reporting on the DMR, actual analytical results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 should be reported whenever possible. All analytical values at or above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 the ML shall be reported as the measured value. When the results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 cannot be quantified, values below the method detection limit (1 &mu;g/L) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 shall be reported as zero (0 &mu;g/L) and values above the method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 detection level and below the ML shall be reported as 1/2 the ML or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2 &mu;g/L.
