SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to the authority of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and Executive
Order 11539, as amended, the Office of the United States Trade Representative has negotiated agreements with the
Governments of Australia and New Zealand whereby those countries have voluntarily agreed to limit the quantity of
certain meats exported to the United States during calendar year 1994. The Secretary of Agriculture, with the concurrence
of the Secretary of State and the United States Trade Representative, is authorized to carry out such agreements and
to implement such action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Presently, 7 CFR part 16, subpart A entitled ``Section 204 Import Regulations'' contains provisions governing the
entry or withdrawal from warehouse of certain meats imported from Australia and New Zealand during calendar year
1993. This rule amends subpart A to delete the provisions relating to Australia and New Zealand for calendar year 1993
which no longer are in effect and inserts new provisions to carry out the voluntary agreements entered into by Australia
and New Zealand with the United States for calendar year 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of meat in the regulations encompasses the Harmonized Tariff Schedules of the United States (HTS)
items which are the subject of the voluntary agreements with Australia and New Zealand. In order to prevent circumvention
of the import limitations, the definition also includes meat that would fall within such definition but for processing
in Foreign-Trade Zones, territories, or possessions of the United States. In addition, the regulations impose transshipment
restrictions which prevent the entry or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of meat from Australia and New
Zealand unless exported from those countries as direct shipments or on through bills of lading or, if processed in
Foreign-Trade Zones, territories or possessions of the United States, shipped as direct shipments or on through
bills of lading from such areas.

Meat released under the provisions of sections 448(b) and 484(a)(1)(A) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1448(b)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been determined to involve foreign affairs functions of the United States. Therefore, this regulation
falls within the foreign affairs exception to Executive Order 12291 and the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect
to proposed rulemaking. Further, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act do not apply to this rule since
the proposed rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply.

Administrator of REA has determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) does not apply to this rule. The Administrator of REA has determined that this rule will not significantly affect
the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->

). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. This rule is excluded
from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation, which may require consultation with State
and local officials. A Notice of Final Rule titled Department Programs and Activities Excluded from Executive Order
12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts REA electric loans and loan guarantees from coverage under this Order. This rule has been
reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Will not preempt any State or local laws,
regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule; (2) Will not have any retroactive
effect; and (3) Will not require administrative proceedings before any parties may file suit challenging the provisions

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 306E of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (RE Act) was amended on December 17, 1993, by Public Law 103&hyph;201.
As amended, the section directs the Administrator to issue interim final regulations to minimize approval rights,
requirements, restrictions, and prohibitions imposed on the operations of electric borrowers whose net worth exceeds
110 percent of the outstanding loans made or guaranteed to the borrower by REA. The section also directs the Administrator,
when requested by a private lender providing financing for capital investments by such borrowers, to offer, without
delay, to share the government's lien on the borrowers' systems or subordinate the government's lien on the property
financed by the private lender. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In issuing the regulations, the Administrator is authorized to establish requirements, guided by the practices
of private lenders with respect to similar credit risks, to ensure that the security for loans made or guaranteed by
REA is reasonably adequate. REA understands this to mean that it may consider the practices of private lenders in general,
and not just those that have lent or are currently lending to REA borrowers. If the regulations are not issued within
180 days of enactment of section 306E, the Administrator may not, until the regulations are issued, require prior
approval of, or establish any requirement, restriction, or prohibition, with respect to the operations of any electric
borrower that meets the 110 percent ratio. Nothing in section 306E limits the authority of the Administrator to establish
terms and conditions on the use of funds from loans made or guaranteed by REA, or to take other actions specifically
authorized by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1710.7 added by this rule addresses the application of section 306E of the RE Act to REA operational controls
that apply in general to REA borrowers or specifically to REA loans and loan guarantees. The application of section
306E to lien accommodations and subordinations is set forth in new sections 7 CFR 1717.860 and 1717.904.

This section sets forth the policy established by section 306E of the RE Act regarding REA operational controls applied
to borrowers that meet the 110 percent net worth ratio; the procedures for determining whether a borrower meets the
110 percent ratio; and the specific operational controls that are or are not exempted for such borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Borrowers' net worth to REA debt ratios will be determined each year based on data as of December 31, and borrowers will
be notified in writing of their respective ratios by May 1 of each year. If a borrower's net worth falls below 110 percent
or if the borrower defaults on any requirement of its mortgage, loan contract, or any other agreement with REA that
has not been exempted by REA, REA may reimpose exempted operational controls by informing the borrower in writing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In calculating net worth, deferred current period expenses properly recordable in accounts 182.2 and 182.3 will
be subtracted from total margins and equities. This is the same procedure followed in 7 CFR part 1717, subpart R to determine
whether a borrower has sufficient net worth to qualify for advance approval of a lien accommodation. It is intended
to prevent net worth from being overstated by the amount of deferred current period expenses. The accounting data
used will be based on REA's system of accounts set forth in 7 CFR part 1767. Since sinking fund depreciation is not approved
under part 1767, net worth for borrowers using sinking fund depreciation will be calculated as if the borrower had
been using straight line depreciation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;1710.7 lists 13 operational controls contained in the REA mortgage or loan contract that are
exempted for borrowers that meet the 110 percent ratio. These include, for example: The requirement that extensions
and additions to the borrower's electric system financed by the borrower's own funds be included in an REA-approved
construction work plan; requirements on contract bidding procedures if no REA loan funds are involved; REA approval
of construction, engineering, and architectural contracts, and the use of REA standard forms of contracts if no REA
loan funds are involved; higher maximum limits on plant additions that may be made without REA approval if no REA loan
funds are involved; higher maximum limits on the sale of electric power and energy to ultimate consumers without REA
approval; higher maximum limits on the voluntary sale, lease or transfer of any capital asset, without REA approval,
in exchange for fair market value; and REA approval of the selection of a borrower's manager, provided that the borrower
is not in default.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two of the 13 exempted operational controls are also exempted for all other borrowers. These are the requirement to
obtain REA approval of the purchase of data processing equipment and system control equipment (except when REA loan
funds are used), and the requirement that distribution borrowers notify REA in writing of proposed changes in electric
rates 90 days prior to the effective date of such rates. The required notification period has been changed to 30 days.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the rule exempts REA approval of the selection of a manager for borrowers that meet the 110 percent test and
are not in default, REA wishes to emphasize again the critical importance of the selection of fully qualified and capable
managers. It is the most important of a board of director's responsibilities. REA will shortly be issuing new guidelines
on manager selection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the convenience of the public, paragraph (d) of &sect;1710.7 lists examples of the operational controls and requirements
that are not exempted. The controls and requirements not exempted fall into two categories: (1) Requirements and
operational controls that are necessary to ensure that the security for loans made or guaranteed by REA is reasonably
adequate and that the loans will be repaid, or to accomplish other fundamental purposes of the RE Act, and (2) requirements
imposed on REA or on borrowers by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The nonexempted controls and requirements include, for example, area coverage requirements; following REA construction
standards and listed materials; certain borrowers having to maintain a power requirements study on an ongoing basis;
the maintenance of minimum levels for the Times Interest Earned Ratio and Debt Service Coverage ratio; REA approval
of certain retirements of capital credits; controls on borrower investments; certain borrowers having to maintain
an equity development plan; requirements on maintenance and repair of the mortgaged property; and REA accounting
and auditing requirements. These requirements and controls are believed to be reasonable in comparison with requirements
imposed by private lenders on customers presenting similar credit risks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) of &sect;1710.7 authorizes REA to reinstate exempted controls and requirements if the borrower is
in default on any requirement of its mortgage, loan contract with REA, or any other agreement with REA that has not been
exempted. REA will notify the borrower in writing of the reinstatement, and it will remain in effect until REA determines
that it is no longer needed to help ensure loan security. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f) is intended to make it clear that if controls are reinstated because the borrower defaults or its net
worth drops below 110 percent of outstanding REA debt, the controls and approval rights will apply to all applicable
subsequent actions by the borrower, including REA approval of amendments to contracts entered into by the borrower
while it was exempt from controls.

Section 1717.860_Lien Accommodations and Subordinations Under Section 306E of the RE Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1717.860 promulgates the requirements of section 306E of the RE Act as they relate to lien accommodations
and subordinations. In determining which borrowers qualify under the 110 percent net worth to REA debt criterion,
the same calculations and procedures are used as in &sect;1710.7, except that the determination is made at the time
of an application for a lien accommodation or subordination and there is no annual notice to borrowers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of &sect;1717.860 establishes that REA will expeditiously approve a lien accommodation or subordination
for financing of capital investments by borrowers that meet the 110 percent test, if the borrower is in compliance
with all requirements of its mortgage, loan contract with REA, and any other agreement with REA that have not been exempted
pursuant to REA regulations, and if the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed by
REA will remain reasonably adequate. The paragraph also lists the information that must be included in the application
for the lien accommodation or subordination.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (d) of &sect;1717.860 expands the circumstances under which a lien subordination may be obtained for investments
in rural development and other non-electric utility endeavors in the case of borrowers that meet the 110 percent test.
It provides that a borrower that meets the 110 percent test is eligible for a lien subordination on the specific assets
financed by a loan made directly to the borrower for rural development or other non-electric utility purposes, provided
that the outstanding balance of all such loans lien subordinated under paragraph (d), after taking into consideration
the effect of the new loan, does not exceed 15 percent of the borrower's net worth and the security, including assurance
of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed by REA will remain reasonably adequate after granting the lien subordination.
While the rule grants this additional latitude to borrowers that meet the 110 percent test, REA continues to urge all
borrowers to use separate subsidiaries when making investments in rural development or other non-electric utility
endeavors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investments lien subordinated under paragraph (d) will be included among those investments subject to the 15 percent
of total utility plant limitation set forth in 7 CFR 1717.654(b)(1), and granting of the lien subordination will not
constitute approval of the investment under 7 CFR part 1717 subpart N. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) of &sect;1717.860 exempts borrowers that meet the 110 percent test from the requirement of &sect;1717.856(d)
that they submit an equity development plan with their application for a lien accommodation or subordination if the
ratio of their equity to total assets is below a specified level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (b)(1)(ii)(A) of &sect;1717.852 are amended to make it clear that programs of
demand side management and energy conservation, and on-grid and off-grid renewable energy systems are eligible
for lien accommodations and subordinations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General policy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Section 306E of the RE Act directs the Administrator to issue interim final regulations to minimize approval rights,
requirements, restrictions, and prohibitions imposed on the operations of electric borrowers whose net worth exceeds
110 percent of the outstanding loans made or guaranteed to the borrower by REA. The section also directs the Administrator,
when requested by a private lender providing financing for capital investments by such borrowers, to offer, without
delay, to share the government's lien on the borrowers' systems or subordinate the government's lien on the property
financed by the private lender. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In issuing the regulations, the Administrator is authorized to establish requirements, guided by the practices
of private lenders with respect to similar credit risks, to ensure that the security, including the assurance of repayment,
for loans made or guaranteed by REA will remain reasonably adequate. If the regulations are not issued within 180 days
of enactment of section 306E, the Administrator may not, until the regulations are issued, require prior approval
of, or establish any requirement, restriction, or prohibition, with respect to the operations of any electric borrower
that meets the 110 percent ratio. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Nothing in section 306E limits the authority of the Administrator to establish terms and conditions on the use
of funds from loans made or guaranteed by REA, to establish loan feasibility criteria and other requirements for the
approval of REA loans or loan guarantees, such as those set forth in this part, or to take any other action specifically
authorized by law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) This section addresses the application of section 306E of the RE Act to REA operational controls and other requirements
that apply in general to REA borrowers. The application of section 306E to lien accommodations and subordinations
is set forth in 7 CFR 1717.860 and 1717.904. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The exemptions granted by this section, 7 CFR 1717.860, and 7 CFR 1717.904 apply only to REA controls and approval
rights. They do not affect the controls and approval rights of other co-mortgagees under the REA mortgage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination of ratio. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following principles and procedures will apply to the calculation of net worth as a ratio, expressed as a percent,
to the outstanding balance of all loans made or guaranteed to the borrower by REA, hereinafter called the borrower's
``net worth to REA debt ratio'', or simply ``the ratio'': 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For purposes of determining whether a borrower is exempt from approvals, requirements, restrictions, or prohibitions
imposed by REA with respect to borrower operations, i.e., ``operational controls,'' the ratio normally will be based
on data as of December 31. Net worth will be based on the year-end financial and statistical reports submitted by borrowers
to REA, and outstanding loans made or guaranteed by REA will be based on REA's records. The financial and statistical
reports (Form 7 for distribution borrowers and Form 12a for power supply borrowers) are subject to REA review and revision,
and they must comply with REA's system of accounts and accounting principles set forth in 7 CFR part 1767. Since sinking
fund depreciation is not approved under part 1767, net worth for borrowers using sinking fund depreciation will be
calculated as if the borrower had been using straight line depreciation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Net worth will be calculated by taking total margins and equities (Line 33 of Part C of REA Form 7 for distribution
borrowers, or Line 34 of Section B of REA Form 12a for power supply borrowers) and subtracting assets properly recordable
in account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, and account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets, as defined
in 7 CFR part 1767; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) By no later than May 1 of each year, REA will notify each borrower in writing of its ratio as of December 31 of the preceding
year. If a borrower's net worth to REA debt ratio exceeds 110 percent based on the year-end data, the borrower will be
exempt from the operational controls exempted under paragraph (c) of this section until subsequently notified in
writing by REA that it is no longer exempt.

Borrower operations exempted from REA controls
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Borrowers who are notified by REA in writing that their net worth to REA debt ratio exceeds 110 percent are exempted
from the operational controls of the REA mortgage and loan contract listed in this paragraph. These controls, which
are implemented through REA regulations and other documents, are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Requirement that extensions or additions to the borrower's electric utility system financed by the borrower's
own funds, as defined in 7 CFR 1717.652, be included in an REA-approved construction work plan. This exemption does
not apply to extensions or additions financed by loans made or guaranteed by REA or by loans for which REA has granted
a lien accommodation or subordination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Requirements on contract bidding procedures, as set forth in &sect;1710.120 and other REA regulations, except
when the construction is funded directly or through reimbursements from loans made or guaranteed by REA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) REA approval of construction contracts and engineering and architectural service contracts, and use of REA standard
forms of contracts, as set forth in &sect;1710.120 and other REA regulations, except when the construction is funded
directly or through reimbursements from loans made or guaranteed by REA. To be eligible for exemption of REA approval
rights, here and elsewhere in this paragraph (c), the contracts must not contain any provisions that prohibit or restrict
the assignment of the contracts to the government upon the exercise by REA of its remedies under security instruments
securing loans made or guaranteed by REA. Throughout this section, REA approval of contracts also includes REA approval
of contract amendments and renewals; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) REA approval of the borrower's use of general funds, as defined as ``own funds'' in 7 CFR 1717.652, for plant extensions
or additions or other investments in the borrower's electric utility system, provided that the funds will not be reimbursed
with funds from a loan made or guaranteed by REA, and: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The plant addition will not provide direct service to any ultimate consumer having an anticipated or contract
kilowatt-hour (kWh) or maximum kilowatt (kW) demand in any year that exceeds 25 percent of the borrower's total kWh
sales or maximum kW demand recorded during the previous calendar year; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the investment is for the addition or substantial reconstruction of generation capacity, the borrower is
a power supply borrower and the addition or substantial reconstruction of capacity will not exceed 25 megawatts.
The exemption under this paragraph (ii) does not apply to distribution borrowers; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) REA approval of contracts for the sale of electric power and energy to ultimate consumers except when the kWh sales
or maximum kW demand covered by the contract is for an amount in any year that exceeds 25 percent of the borrower's total
kWh sales or maximum kW demand during the previous calendar year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) REA approval of power purchase contracts with suppliers that do not receive financial assistance from REA, provided
that the contract is for a period of not more than 1 year and the kWh amount of energy or maximum kW capacity to be purchased
under the contract does not exceed 25 percent of the total kWh amount of energy purchased and/or generated by the borrower,
or maximum kW demand of the borrower, during the previous calendar year; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) REA approval of transmission, interconnection, and power pooling contracts that cover a period of one year or
less; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) REA approval of contracts for the operation and management and/or maintenance of a borrower's system, provided
that the contract does not cover all or substantially all of the borrower's system; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) REA approval of the voluntary sale, lease or transfer by the borrower of any capital asset in exchange for fair market
value if: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The borrower is not in default under its mortgage, loan contract with REA, or any other agreement with REA. (As used
in this section, the term default includes defaults declared by the mortgagee as well as events that have occurred
and are continuing, which, with notice or lapse of time and notice, would become events of default.);

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) The proceeds of such sale, lease or transfer are applied as required by the REA mortgage; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The value of the capital asset is less than 5 percent of net utility plant and the aggregate value of capital assets
sold, leased or transferred in any 12-month period is less than 10 percent of net utility plant; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If the borrower has an REA-approved wholesale power contract with a power supply borrower (seller), the circumstances
of the sale, lease or transfer of capital assets conform with the conditions in such contract under which the seller
may not withhold its consent to the sale, lease or transfer. The exemption of REA approval rights under this paragraph
(c)(9) applies only to voluntary sales, leases, and transfers, and does not affect REA's right under section 7 of the
RE Act to approve other dispositions of property by the borrower; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) REA approval of the selection of a borrower's manager, provided that the borrower is not in default under its mortgage,
loan contract with REA, or any other agreement with REA. Nothing herein shall limit the right of REA under the mortgage
to request termination of the employment of a manager in the event of a default by the borrower; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) REA approval, as set forth in the loan contract, of a borrower's selection of a bank in which funds of the borrower
are or will be deposited, provided that the borrower is not in default under its mortgage, loan contract with REA, or
any other agreement with REA. The requirement that such bank must be a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
is not exempted; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) REA approval of the purchase of data processing equipment and system control equipment, except when funds for
the equipment, including reimbursements, derive from loans made or guaranteed by REA. This exemption, as well as
that set forth in paragraph (c)(13) of this section, also applies to all other borrowers, i.e., those that do not meet
the 110 percent equity ratio; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Requirement that distribution borrowers notify REA in writing of proposed changes in electric rates 90 days
prior to the effective date of such rates. Instead, the required notification period shall be 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
REA requirements and operational controls not exempted
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All requirements and operational controls contained in the REA mortgage and loan contract, or otherwise imposed
on borrowers pursuant to statute or regulation, that are not specifically listed in paragraph (c) of this section
are not exempted and shall continue to apply according to their terms. Examples of such requirements and controls
not exempted are listed in this paragraph for the convenience of the public. This list is not exhaustive, and the absence
of a requirement or control from this list in no way means that the requirement or control has been exempted: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Requirements and operational controls contained in the REA mortgage or loan contract that are necessary to ensure
that the security for loans made or guaranteed by REA is reasonably adequate and that the loans will be repaid, or to
accomplish other fundamental purposes of the RE Act. Some of these also represent terms and conditions with respect
to the use by borrowers of the proceeds of loans made or guaranteed by REA. Together, these controls include, but are
not limited to, the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Area coverage requirements set forth in the loan contract and in &sect;1710.103; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the purposes of &sect;1717.860, capital investment means an original investment in an asset that is intended
for long-term continued use or possession and, for accounting purposes, is normally depreciated or depleted as it
is used. For example, such assets may include land, facilities, equipment, buildings, mineral deposits, patents,
trademarks, and franchises. Original investments do not include refinancings or refundings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 306E of the RE Act, when requested by a private lender providing financing for capital investments by
a borrower whose net worth exceeds 110 percent of the outstanding principal balance of all loans made or guaranteed
to the borrower by REA, the Administrator will, without delay, offer to share the government's lien on the borrower's
system or subordinate the government's lien on the property financed by the private lender, provided that the security,
including the assurance of repayment, for loans made or guaranteed by REA will remain reasonably adequate. To qualify
for a lien accommodation or subordination under this section, the investment must be an original capital investment,
i.e., not a refinancing or refunding. (See &sect;1717.851 for the definition of capital investment.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination of net worth to REA debt ratio. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) In the case of applications for a lien accommodation, a borrower's net worth will be based on the borrower's most
recent financial and statistical report, the data in which shall not be more than 60 days old at the time the application
is received by REA, and the outstanding debt owed to or guaranteed by REA will be based on latest REA records available.
The financial and statistical reports (Form 7 for distribution borrowers and Form 12a for power supply borrowers)
are subject to REA review and revision, and they must comply with REA's system of accounts and accounting principles
set forth in 7 CFR part 1767. Since sinking fund depreciation is not approved under part 1767, net worth for borrowers
using sinking fund depreciation will be calculated as if the borrower had been using straight line depreciation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Net worth shall be calculated by taking total margins and equities (Line 33 of Part C of REA Form 7 for distribution
borrowers, or Line 34 of Section B of REA Form 12a for power supply borrowers) and subtracting assets properly recordable
in account 182.2, Unrecovered Plant and Regulatory Study Costs, and account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets, as defined
in 7 CFR part 1767.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application requirements and process. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If a borrower's net worth to REA debt ratio exceeds 110 percent, as determined by REA, and the borrower is in compliance
with all requirements of its mortgage, loan agreement with REA, and any other agreement with REA that have not been
exempted in writing by REA, if requested REA will expeditiously approve a lien accommodation or subordination for
100 percent private financing of capital investments, provided that the security, including the assurance of repayment,
for loans made or guaranteed by REA will remain reasonably adequate. REA's approval will be conditioned upon execution
and delivery by the borrower of a security instrument satisfactory to REA, if required, and such additional information,
documents, and opinions of counsel as REA may require. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The application must include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A resolution of the borrower's board of directors requesting the lien accommodation and including the amount
and maturity of the proposed loan, a general description of the facilities or other purposes to be financed, the name
and address of the lender, and an attached term sheet summarizing the terms and conditions of the proposed loan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A certification by an authorized official of the borrower that the borrower is in compliance with all requirements
of its mortgage, loan agreement with REA, and any other agreement with REA that have not been exempted in writing by
REA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The borrower's financial and statistical report, the data in which shall not be more than 60 days old when the
complete application is received by REA;

(iv) Draft copy of any new mortgage or mortgage amendment (supplement) required by REA or the lender, unless REA has
notified the borrower that it wishes to prepare these documents itself; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A copy of the loan agreement, loan note, bond or other financing instrument, unless REA has notified the borrower
that these documents need not be submitted. These documents will not be subject to REA approval, but may be reviewed
to determine whether they contain any provisions that would result in the security, including assurance of repayment,
for loans made or guaranteed by REA no longer being reasonably adequate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) The following certifications and reports required by law:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Form AD&hyph;1047, Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other Responsibility Matters_Primary
Covered Transactions, as required by 7 CFR part 3017; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) A report by the borrower stating whether or not it is delinquent on any Federal debt, and if delinquent, the amount
and age of the delinquency and the reasons therefor; and a certification, if not previously provided, that the borrower
has been informed of the Government's collection options; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) The written acknowledgement from a registered engineer or architect regarding compliance with seismic provisions
of applicable model codes for any buildings to be constructed, as required by 7 CFR 1792.104. All other elements of
an application listed in &sect;1717.855, &sect;1717.856, and &sect;1717.858(c) not listed in this paragraph (c)
are exempted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Applications from distribution borrowers are submitted to the general field representative (GFR), while applications
from power supply borrowers are submitted to the REA Power Supply Division, or its successor, in Washington, DC. When
an application is satisfactory to the GFR, it will be sent promptly to the Washington office. If Washington office
staff determine that an application is incomplete, the borrower will be promptly notified in writing about the deficiencies.
When the application is complete, and if the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed
by REA will remain reasonably adequate after granting the lien accommodation or subordination, the borrower and
the lender will be promptly notified in writing that the lien accommodation or subornation has been approved, subject
to the conditions cited in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

Rural development and other non-electric utility investments. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although REA recommends the use of separate subsidiaries as set forth in &sect;1717.858, if requested by a borrower
that meets the 110 percent equity test and all other applicable requirements of this section, REA will provide a lien
subordination on the specific assets financed in the case of loans made directly to the borrower for rural development
and other non-electric utility purposes, provided that the outstanding balance of all such loans lien subordinated
under this paragraph (d), after taking into consideration the effect of the new loan, does not exceed 15 percent of
the borrower's net worth and the security, including assurance of repayment, of loans made or guaranteed by REA will
remain reasonably adequate after granting the lien subordination. Investments lien subordinated under this paragraph
shall be included among those investments subject to the 15 percent of total utility plant limitation set forth in
7 CFR 1717.654(b)(1), and granting of the lien subordination will not constitute approval of the investment under
7 CFR Part 1717, subpart N.

Borrowers that qualify for a lien accommodation or lien subordination under this section are exempt from the requirement
set forth in &sect;1717.856(d) that they submit an equity development plan as part of their application. This exemption
applies only to applications for a lien accommodation or subordination, and does not exempt borrowers from the requirements
of 7 CFR 1710.116 applicable to applications for a loan or loan guarantee from REA.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 21, 1993, Agusta Aerospace Corporation, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, applied for a Supplemental Type Certificate
for installation of an Electronic Flight Instrument System in the Agusta Model A109C helicopter. This model is a 7
passenger, 2 engine, 5,997 pound normal category helicopter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Type Certification Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The certification basis established for the Agusta Model A109C helicopter includes: Federal Aviation Regulation
(FAR) &sect;21.29; part 27 effective February 1, 1965, Amendments 27&hyph;1 through 27&hyph;8; FAR part 29 dated
February 1, 1965, paragraph 29.903(b), for Category ``A'' engine isolation; and equivalent safety in lieu of compliance
shown for: FAR 27.1189 (regarding shut-off means); FAR 27.927(c) as amended by Amendment 27&hyph;12; and Airworthiness
Criteria for Helicopter Instrument Flight, eligible for day and night Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations,
with one or two pilots, when Agusta Kit No. 109&hyph;0810&hyph;22, Revision E or later approved revision, is incorporated,
and the helicopter is operated in accordance with the Model A109C Rotorcraft Flight Manual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate
safety standards for this helicopter because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed
under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with FAR &sect;11.49 after public notice, as required
by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(2)
for changes to the type certificates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Novel or Unusual Design Feature
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Agusta Model A109C helicopter was identified as incorporating one or possibly more electrical, electronic,
or combination of electrical electronic (electrical/electronic) systems that will be performing functions critical
to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopter. The Electronic Flight Instrument System performs the
attitude display function. The display of attitude, altitude, and airspeed to the pilot is critical to the continued
safe flight and landing of the helicopter for IFR operations in Instrument Meteorological Conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If it is determined that these helicopters will incorporate other electrical/electronic systems performing critical
functions, those systems also will be required to comply with the requirements of this special condition.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11
series airplanes, that requires replacing the anti-skid control unit. This amendment is prompted by three reports
of failure of the center landing gear drag link, after which the center landing gear swung aft and struck the fuselage.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the center landing gear drag link, which could result
in extensive damage to the fuselage structure.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 16, 1993 (58 FR 38321). That action proposed to require replacing the anti-skid control unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggests that the proposed AD action is inappropriate for two reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Drag link failures occur only with the use of autobraking. Therefore, if only manual brakes are used, there should
be no requirement to modify the anti-skid control unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Failure of the center landing gear drag link does not pose sufficient risk to the airframe to warrant AD action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur with the commenter's suggestion that this AD action is not warranted. As for the commenter's
Item 1, the FAA points out that there has been at least one case of failure of the center gear with the application of manual
brakes prior to touchdown of the nose gear wheel. By replacing the Part Number (P/N) 6005304&hyph;1 control unit with
the P/N 6005304&hyph;2 unit (as required by this AD), center gear braking is inhibited both manually and through the
use of autobrakes until nose gear touchdown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for the commenter's Item 2, the FAA notes that there have been at least three in-service failures of center landing
gear drag links that have caused significant structural damage to the airplane. In each occurrence, the failed drag
link allowed the center landing gear to swing aft and strike the fuselage. Additionally, there are numerous other
possible scenarios involving similar failures that could result in damage to the hydraulic and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
electrical systems of the airplane. The center landing gear is also needed to properly distribute the airplane's
weight for heavy weight landings. For these reasons, the FAA considers that failure of the center landing gear drag
link does present an unsafe condition sufficient to warrant mandated corrective action. The appropriate vehicle
for mandating such corrective action is the airworthiness directive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters request that the proposed compliance time of 9 months be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended to 12 months. The manufacturer has indicated that the fleet of affected Model MD&hyph;11's could not be retrofitted
within 9 months, given the current schedule of modifying the subject part on a rotatable basis and the capacity of the
manufacturer to modify the control units. The FAA concurs with the commenter's request. Extending the compliance
time an additional 3 months will not adversely affect safety and will allow the affected fleet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be modified in an orderly manner, thereby minimizing the costs associated with special airplane scheduling. Paragraph
(a) of the final rule has been revised to specify a compliance time of 12 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the wording of references to the anti-skid control unit be clarified. The preamble to
the notice referred to ``the anti-skid control unit for the center landing gear;'' however, this control unit controls
all of the landing gears, not just the center landing gear. The FAA agrees that clarification of this point is needed
and, where appropriate, has changed the wording in this final rule accordingly.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 86 McDonnell Douglas Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide
fleet. The FAA estimates that 32 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
1 work hour per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required
parts will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of the AD on U.S. operators is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated to be $1,760, or $55 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the
requirements of this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

 The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) revises part 266 in order to provide more detailed guidelines regarding the
selection, payment, responsibilities, and monitoring of representative payees. The title of part 266 is also changed
from ``Incompetence'' to ``Representative Payment'' which better describes the contents of part 266. These revisions
are being made to improve the administration of the Board's representative payee program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 (45 U.S.C. 231 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) provides a system of retirement and disability benefits for railroad employees, their spouses, children, and survivors
who meet certain eligibility requirements under that Act. Section 12 of the Act (45 U.S.C. 231k) contains the same
provisions as section 19 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937, the predecessor of the present Act, regarding the
competence of an annuitant and the Board's authority in cases where an annuitant is incompetent. Under these provisions,
any claimant or annuitant is presumed to be competent until the Board receives written notice to the contrary. If a
claimant or annuitant is incompetent, the Board may make payments to, or conduct transactions with, any legally appointed
guardian on behalf of the claimant or annuitant. Furthermore, section 12(a) expressly authorizes the Board to make
payments, or conduct transactions, directly with the claimant or annuitant, or with any other person on his or her
behalf, even though he or she is an incompetent for whom a guardian is acting. The provisions of section 12 are applicable
to benefits claimed or paid under any Act administered in whole or in part by the Board, including any claim for or payment
of social security benefits administered by the Board pursuant to section 7(b)(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act
(45 U.S.C. 231f(b)(2)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There has been growing concern in the Congress to assure that surrogate decision making services, including representative-payee
services, are provided in a uniform, high quality manner which maximizes the potential of every individual for self-reliance
and independence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Board is currently in the process of a comprehensive review, revision, and amendment of its regulations,
part 266 is revised at this time to address concerns that adequate safeguards be provided where payment of an annuity
under the Railroad Retirement Act is made to a representative payee rather than directly to the annuitant. Thus, the
revised part 266 expands, as well as revises, the present regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A brief summary of the disposition of the various section of the present part 266 under the proposed regulation is set
forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present &sect;266.1 simply sets forth the statutory provisions of section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA)
(45 U.S.C. 231k), and because of this redundancy, is removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present &sect;266.2 has been incorporated into &sect;266.1(b) of the revised regulation. The new &sect;266.1
sets forth an introduction, consisting of an explanation of representative payment and the law and policy used to
determine whether to make representative payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present &sect;266.3 has been incorporated into &sect;266.3(a) of the revised regulation. The new &sect;266.3
sets forth information which the Board will consider in determining whether to make representative payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present &sect;266.4 has been redesignated as &sect;266.12. New &sect;266.4 sets forth what information the
Board will use in selecting a representative payee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraphs (a) and (b) of the present &sect;266.5 have been redesignated as &sect;266.2, and the term ``beneficiary''
has been removed and the term ``annuitant'' has been added in its place throughout the new part 266. New &sect;266.5
describes the order of preference the Board will generally use in selecting representative payees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present &sect;266.6 has been incorporated into the new &sect;266.9(a). The new &sect;266.9 sets forth general
responsibilities of a representative payee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present &sect;&sect;266.7, 266.9, 266.10, and 266.11 have been revised and incorporated into a single section,
&sect;266.10, which details how a representative payee is to use benefit payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present &sect;266.8, ``Conservation and investment of benefit payments,'' has been revised and incorporated
into the new &sect;266.11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sections &sect;&sect;266.6, 266.7, and 266.8 are new. Section 266.6 provides that a representative payee applicant
must provide the Board with the information listed in &sect;266.4 and will generally be required to undergo a face-to-face
interview with a field representative of the Board. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section &sect;266.7 provides that the representative payee make an accounting to the Board for the use of benefits
he or she 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives as payee and sets forth what information will satisfy the requirement of an accounting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section &sect;266.8 provides that an annuitant may challenge the appointment or selection of a representative payee.
However, an individual who requests to be made a representative payee for an annuitant has no standing to challenge
the Board's refusal to make the appointment.

The present &sect;266.12 has been revised and incorporated into the new &sect;266.7(c) described above. Section
&sect;266.12, as noted earlier, is the redesignated &sect;266.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present &sect;266.13 has been redesignated as the new &sect;266.15. Sections &sect;&sect;266.13 and 266.14
are new. The former section describes when the Board will terminate an individual's status as a representative payee
and appoint a new one. The latter section describes what evidence an annuitant must provide to the Board to terminate
representative payments and thereby receive benefits directly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board published this regulation as a proposed rule on March 10, 1993 (58 FR 13225), requesting comments by April
9, 1993. A number of comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that a paragraph be added to &sect;266.4 (Information considered in selecting a representative
payee) to provide that a creditor who provides goods and services to the annuitant should not be able to serve as a representative
payee unless such creditor is a relative, legal guardian, or connected with a licensed or certified care facility.
The Board agrees with this comment and a new paragraph (i) is added to &sect;266.4 to reflect this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that &sect;266.6 be modified to require a face-to-face interview with the payee-applicant
rather than a discretionary interview as was proposed in that section. In the Board's experience a mandatory interview
with the payee-applicant is not always necessary. In many cases the payee-applicant is a court appointed legal guardian
or conservator or is a licensed care facility. However, the Board will modify its internal procedures to provide that
where the payee-applicant is not interviewed, the Board employee responsible for developing the application for
representative payment shall document in writing why no interview was done. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the same vein, another commenter suggested that the regulation provide for a mandatory interview with the annuitant
when a payee is proposed and that the Board seek suggestions from the annuitant as to whom would make an appropriate
payee. As in the case of payee-applicant, the Board has found that a requirement to interview the annuitant in each
and every case where a representative-payee is required is not necessary. In many cases, the reason for the appointment
of a representative payee is that the annuitant is no longer sentient or capable of significant communication. Of
course, in these cases a requirement for an interview would serve no purpose. Rather than adopt a mandatory requirement
for an interview with the annuitant, the Board is of the opinion that the better approach is the one referred to above
with respect to the payee-applicant interview; namely, that the annuitant will be interviewed and his or her recommendations
sought whenever possible. Where the annuitant is not interviewed, the Board employee responsible for developing
the application for representative-payee must document the basis for not conducting the interview. The Board's
internal operating procedures will be modified to reflect this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment was also received with respect to &sect;&sect;266.7 (b) and (c). Under these sections where the representative
payee fails to provide the Board with an accounting of his or her expenditures or fails to provide other information,
the Board may suspend payment to the payee and then the payments are held in trust by the Board until a new representative
payee is found or payments are reinstated to the present payee. One commenter was concerned that the regulation did
not provide that if a new representative payee is not found, or payment to the present representative payee reinstated,
within 30 days, that payments were not required to be made to the annuitant. The commenter pointed out that such a provision
is provided for in the Social Security Act with respect to its representative payee program. See 42 U.S.C. 204(j)(2)(D).
In the Board's experience the vast majority of annuitants for whom representative payees are appointed are not competent
to handle their finances. When payment to a representative payee is suspended pending appointment of a new payee,
the Board seeks to appoint a new payee with the utmost speed. However, this process may take longer than 30 days because,
as the commenter pointed out, there is indeed a shortage of individuals willing to act as representative payees. On
the other hand, making payments to an individual who cannot manage his or her own affairs would not be in the best interest
of the annuitant. Consequently, the Board has modified &sect;266.7 by adding a new paragraph (d) which provides that
where payment to a representative payee is suspended to appoint a new representative payee, such payment must be reinstated
within 30 days unless the annuitant is an unemancipated minor under age 18, or is judged by the Board to be incapable
of handling his benefit payments, in which case the Board will hold the payments in trust until a new representative
payee is appointed.

Finally, one commenter suggested that the Board seek legislative authority to impose administrative penalties
on representative payees who misuse funds. The Board agrees that this suggestion has merit and will take it under advisement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order 12866; therefore,
no regulatory impact analysis is required. Information collection has been approved by the Office of Management
and Budget under control numbers 3220&hyph;0151 and 3220&hyph;0052.

Explanation of representative payment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This part explains the principles and procedures that the Board follows in determining whether to make representative
payment and in selecting a representative payee. It also explains the responsibilities that a representative payee
has concerning the use of the funds which he or she receives on behalf of an annuitant. A representative payee may be
either a person or an organization selected by the Board to receive benefits on behalf of an annuitant. A representative
payee will be selected if the Board believes that the interest of an annuitant will be served by representative payment
rather than direct payment of benefits. Generally, the Board will appoint a representative payee if it determines
that the annuitant is not able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments in his or her interest.

Statutory authority.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act provides that every annuitant and claimant shall be conclusively presumed
to have been competent until the date on which the Board receives a notice in writing that a legal guardian or other person
legally vested with the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or a minor has been appointed: Provided, however,
That despite receiving such notice, the Board may, if it finds the interests of such annuitant or claimant to be served
thereby, recognize actions by, conduct transactions with, and make payments to such annuitant or claimant.

Policy used to determine whether to make representative payment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) In accordance with section 12 of the Railroad Retirement Act, the Board's policy is that every annuitant has the
right to manage his or her own benefits. However, some annuitants due to mental or physical condition or due to their
youth may be unable to do so. If the Board determines that the interests of an annuitant would be better served if benefit
payments were certified to another person as representative payee, the Board will appoint a representative payee
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this part. The Board may appoint a representative payee even if the annuitant
is a legally competent individual. If the annuitant is a legally incompetent individual, the Board may appoint the
legal guardian or some other person as a representative payee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If payment is being made directly to an annuitant and a question arises concerning his or her ability to manage or
direct the management of benefit payments, the Board may, if the annuitant is 18 years old or older and has not been adjudged
legally incompetent, continue to pay the annuitant until the Board makes a determination about his or her ability
to manage or direct the management of benefit payments and the selection of a representative payee.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Regardless of the receipt of written notice of the appointment of a guardian or other person legally vested with
the care of the person or estate of an incompetent or a minor who is receiving or claiming benefits or to whom any right
or privilege is extended under the law, the Board may, in its discretion, validly recognize actions by and conduct
transactions with others acting on behalf of the individual found by the Board to be a minor or to be unable to manage
his or her affairs, if the Board finds such actions or transactions to be in the best interest of such individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) In the absence of a written notice of the appointment of a guardian or other person legally vested with the care of
the person or estate of an incompetent or minor, the Board shall, except where special circumstances appear, recognize
a person to act on behalf of an individual under the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When the individual has been adjudged mentally incompetent by a court having jurisdiction to do so;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the individual has been committed to a mental institution by a court having jurisdiction to do so;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the individual is an inmate of a mental institution;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) When the individual is less than 16 years of age; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) When the individual is between 16 and 18 years of age and is in the care of another person and does not have the capacity
to act on his or her own behalf.

Medical evidence.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board may use medical evidence, when such is available, to help determine whether an annuitant is capable of managing
or directing the management of benefit payments. For example, a statement by a physician or other medical professional
based upon his or her recent examination of the annuitant and his or her knowledge of the annuitant's present condition
will be used in the Board's determination, if it includes information concerning the nature of the annuitant's illness,
the annuitant's chances for recovery and the opinion of the physician or other medical professional as to whether
the annuitant is able to manage or direct the management of benefit payments.

the management of benefit payments.

 Information considered in selecting a representative payee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In selecting a representative payee, the Board tries to select the person, agency, organization or institution that
will best serve the interest of the annuitant. In making this selection, the Board may consider such factors as the
following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The relationship of the person to the annuitant, including the type of relationship, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 family or legal guardianship; degree of relationship, if the person is a family member; and the length of association,
if a non-family member;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The amount of interest that the person shows in the annuitant, including the contributions the person makes to
the welfare of the annuitant and the contacts and frequency of such contacts with the annuitant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Any legal authority the person, agency, organization or institution has to act on behalf of the annuitant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Whether the potential payee has custody of the annuitant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Whether the potential payee is in a position to know of and look after the needs of the annuitant;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Verification of the social security account number, name, address, telephone number, place of employment, and
main source of income if applicable, accepted as part of any person's application for designation as a representative
payee, unless such person's identification has already been established to the satisfaction of the Board;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Whether an applicant for designation as a representative payee has ever been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor
under the statutes administered by the Board or the Social Security Act, or convicted of a felony under any other Federal
or State law; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Whether the services of such person as representative payee have previously been terminated, suspended, or declined
by the Board or the Social Security Administration for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Misuse of the benefits of the annuitant for whom they were intended;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Failure to comply with any provision of or regulation under the Railroad Retirement Act or the Social Security
Act; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Failure to meet the requirements of this part.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Accountability of a representative payee.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A representative payee is accountable for the use of benefits. The Board will require periodic written reports
from representative payees. The Board may also, at the Board's option, verify how a representative payee used benefit
payments. A representative payee must keep records of what was done with all benefit payments in order to make accounting
reports. The Board may ask the following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The amount of benefit payments on hand at the beginning of the accounting period; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) How the benefit payments were used; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) How much of the benefit payments were saved and how the savings were invested; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Where the annuitant lived during the accounting period; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The amount of the annuitant's income from other sources during the accounting period. The Board may ask for information
about other funds to enable the Board to evaluate the use of benefit payments; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Whether the representative payee has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor offense under the statutes administered
by the Board or by the Social Security Administration within the past 15 years or whether any such charges are pending.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An individual to whom payments are certified as representative payee on behalf of an annuitant shall submit a written
report in such form and at such times as the Board may require, accounting for the payments certified to him or her on
behalf of the annuitant. If, however, such payee is a court-appointed fiduciary and, as such, is required to make an
annual accounting to the court, a true copy of each such account filed with the court may be submitted in lieu of the accounting
form prescribed by the Board. If any representative payee fails to submit the required accounting within a reasonable
period of time after it is requested, no further payments shall be made to him or her on behalf of the annuitant unless
for good cause shown, the default of the representative payee is excused by the Board, and the required accounting
is thereafter submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) At any time after the Board has selected a representative payee, the Board may ask such payee to submit information
showing a continuing relationship to the annuitant and a continuing responsibility for the care of the annuitant.
If the representative payee does not give the Board the requested information within a reasonable period of time,
the Board may stop paying such payee unless the Board determines that the payee had a good reason for not complying with
the Board's request, and the Board receives the information requested.

exceed a period of 30 days; thereafter, the payments will be made to the annuitant except where the annuitant is an unemancipated
minor under age 18 or where in the Board's judgment the interests of the annuitant would not be served by releasing payment
to the annuitant.

Advance notice of the determination to make representative payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) As a general rule, whenever the Board intends to make representative payment and to name a representative payee,
the Board will notify the annuitant or, in the case of an unemancipated minor under age 18, or an individual who is legally
incompetent, the individual acting on his or her behalf of the Board's proposed actions. Such notice will tell the
person that the Board plans to name a representative payee and who that payee will be. The notice will also ask the person
to contact the Board within 15 days of the date of the notice if he or she objects to either proposed action. If he or she
objects to either proposed action, the objecting party may_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Review the evidence upon which the proposed actions will be based; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Submit any additional evidence regarding the proposed actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the objecting party objects to the proposed actions, the Board will review its proposed determinations and
consider any additional information provided. The Board will then issue a decision on whether to appoint a representative
payee and who that payee will be. If the objecting party is dissatisfied with either determination, he or she may request
a reconsideration under part 260 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the objecting party does not file a timely objection to the proposed actions, the Board will issue a decision
on whether to appoint a representative payee and who that payee will be. If the objecting party is dissatisfied with
either determination, he or she may request a reconsideration under part 260 of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A request for reconsideration or an appeal from a determination under this section under part 260 of this chapter
shall not prevent the Board from making payments to a representative payee during the pendency of such reconsideration
or appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The Board's failure or refusal to select an individual as representative payee or the Board's termination of representative
payee status with respect to an individual is not subject to a request for reconsideration or an appeal under part 260
of this chapter by such individual.

(a) A representative payee shall, subject to review by the Board and to such requirements as it may from time-to-time
prescribe, apply the payments made to him or her on behalf of the annuitant only for the use and benefit of such annuitant,
and in a manner and for purposes which are in the annuitant's best interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A representative payee shall notify the Board of any event that will affect the amount of benefits the annuitant
receives or the right of the annuitant to receive benefits.

 Payments made to an individual as representative payee on behalf of an annuitant shall be considered as having been
applied for the use and benefit of the annuitant when they are used for the annuitant's current maintenance. Current
maintenance includes costs incurred in obtaining food, shelter, clothing, medical care, and personal comfort items.

 If an annuitant is receiving care in a Federal, state, or private institution because of mental or physical incapacity,
current maintenance includes the customary charges made by the institution in providing care and maintenance, as
well as expenditures for those items which will aid in the annuitant's recovery or release from the institution or
expenses for personal needs which will improve the annuitant's conditions while in the institution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A retroactive railroad retirement annuity check in the amount of $2,100, representing benefits due for November
1989 through January 1990, was issued on behalf of the annuitant to the annuitant's daughter, who is the representative
payee. The check was certified in February 1990. The nursing home, where the annuitant resides, is owed money for maintenance

charges would be consistent with the Board's guidelines.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If benefit payments made to a representative payee are not needed for the annuitant's current maintenance or reasonably
foreseeable needs or the support of legal dependents or to pay creditors in accordance with &sect;266.10, they shall
be conserved or invested on behalf of the annuitant. Such funds must be invested in accordance with the rules applicable
to investment of trust estates by trustees. Any investment must show clearly that the representative payee holds
the property in trust for the annuitant.

Preferred investments for excess funds are deposits in an interest or dividend paying account in a bank, trust company,
credit union, or savings and loan association which is insured under either Federal or State law, direct obligations
of the United States Government or obligations for which both principal and interest are guaranteed unconditionally
by the United States Government. The account must be in a form which shows clearly that the representative payee has
only a fiduciary, and not a personal, interest in the funds. If the payee is the legally appointed guardian or fiduciary
of the annuitant, the account may be established to indicate this relationship. If the payee is not the legally appointed
guardian or fiduciary, the accounts may be established as follows:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This revision to part 336 revises the part heading from ``Exhaustion of Rights to Benefits'' to ``Duration of Normal
and Extended Benefits'', and consists of two subparts. Subpart A explains how long a qualified railroad employee
may receive normal unemployment and sickness benefits. Subpart B explains under what circumstances an employee
with 10 or more years of railroad service may receive extended unemployment or sickness benefits and the duration
of an employee's extended benefit period. This rule also removes existing &sect;336.3, which relates to payment
of extended unemployment benefits under the Temporary Extended Railroad Unemployment Insurance Benefits Act of
1961. Extended benefits are no longer payable under that Act. As revised, &sect;336.3 explains the duration of normal
sickness benefits under the RUIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 17, 1993, the Board published this rule as a proposed rule (58 FR 43577), inviting comments on or before September
16, 1993. No comments were received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order No. 12866;
therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required. The information collection requirements contained in this
rule have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3220&hyph;0070.

General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This subpart explains how long a qualified employee may receive normal unemployment or sickness benefits under the
Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act during a benefit year. Under section 2(c) of that Act, normal unemployment benefits
are payable for up to 130 days of unemployment within a benefit year, or in an amount equal to the amount of the employee's
``base year compensation'', whichever is less. A similar limitation applies to the payment of sickness benefits.
An employee who exhausts his or her normal unemployment or sickness benefits may be eligible for payment of extended
unemployment or extended sickness benefits under the conditions set forth in subpart B of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definitions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The terms ``benefit year'', ``base year'', and ``compensation'' are defined in part 302 of this chapter. The term
``registration period'' is defined in parts 325 and 335 of this chapter. For the purposes of this subpart, and as explained
in &sect;336.4 of this part, an employee's ``base year compensation'' may include compensation in excess of the monthly
compensation base (as defined in part 302 of this chapter) even though such excess may not be counted for the purpose
of determining whether such employee is a ``qualified employee'' within the meaning of part 302.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recovery of benefits.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When unemployment or sickness benefits are recovered by the Board for one or more days, the Board will disregard those
days in determining whether the employee has exhausted normal unemployment or sickness benefits with respect to
the applicable benefit year.

130 compensable day limitation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A qualified employee who has satisfied the waiting period for a benefit year may receive benefits for a maximum of 130
days of unemployment within such benefit year, subject to the limitation on payment explained in paragraph (b) of
this section. In any registration period beginning after the end of the waiting period and before the beginning of
the next ensuing benefit year, benefits are payable for days of unemployment in excess of four, but the aggregate number
of compensable days may not exceed 130 for the benefit year. An employee who is unemployed on all days during a registration
period could have a maximum of 10 compensable days of unemployment in such registration period. The amount of benefits
for each compensable day of unemployment is the amount of the daily benefit rate computed for such employee pursuant
to part 330 of this chapter.

Base year compensation limit.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, the Board will not pay unemployment benefits to
a qualified employee, with respect to his or her days of unemployment within a benefit year, in an amount greater than
the amount of his or her base year compensation, as computed under &sect;336.4 of this part.

 The limitations set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section also apply to an employee whose unemployment is
due to a stoppage of work because of a strike in the establishment, premises, or enterprise at which he was last employed.
But no unemployment benefits are payable for the employee's first 14 days of unemployment due to such stoppage of work.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The duration of normal sickness benefits is the same as the duration of normal unemployment benefits, as set forth
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;336.2 of this part. A qualified employee who has satisfied the benefit year waiting period and is otherwise
eligible for sickness benefits may receive benefits for a maximum of 130 days of sickness within a benefit year, but
the amount paid as sickness benefits may not exceed the amount of the employee's base year compensation, as computed
under &sect;336.4 of this part.

Formula.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the purposes of this part, an employee's base year compensation includes any compensation in excess of the monthly
compensation base (as defined in part 302 of this chapter) for any month in the applicable base year but shall not include
any amount that exceeds the value of ``X'' in the following formula: X = $775(A/$600). In this formula, ``A'' is the
dollar amount of the monthly compensation base with respect to months in such base year. For example, if an employee
had railroad earnings of $1,500 per month in each of three months in base year 1990, the employee's base year compensation
for purposes of part 302 of this chapter would be $2,235 (three times the monthly compensation base of $745 per month
for months in 1990). But the employee's base year compensation for purposes of computing maximum normal unemployment
(or sickness) benefits under this subpart would be $2,886 (three times $962), and his or her normal unemployment (or
sickness) benefits would not be considered exhausted until he or she is paid unemployment (or sickness) benefits
in an amount equal to $2,886. In this example, $962 is the amount computed as the value of ``X'' in the above formula when
``A'' is equal to $745.

Employer's duty to report.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The base year employer(s) of an employee shall provide information as to the amount of an employee's monthly compensation
in excess of the monthly compensation base, as defined in part 302 of this chapter, unless the amount of the employee's
compensation at the monthly compensation base limit, as already reported to the Board, is equal to or greater than
an amount equal to 130 times the daily benefit rate applicable to the employee's days of unemployment or days of sickness.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Statutory basis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For the purposes of this part, an employee is not eligible for extended unemployment or sickness benefits if he or
she does not have at least 10 years of railroad service. An employee who has 120 service months as defined in part 210
of this chapter, whether or not consecutive, is considered to have 10 years of railroad service, and an employee who
has 180 service months, whether or not consecutive, is considered to have 15 years of railroad service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Initial determination
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Board will determine whether an employee has 10 years, or 15 years, of railroad service on the basis of reports
filed by employers pursuant to part 209 of this chapter. The number of years of service shown in the Board's records
will be accepted as correct for the purposes of this part, unless the employee claims credit for more service than that
shown in the Board's records and such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional service is verified. In any such case, the Board will afford the employee an opportunity to establish credit
for additional service if such service would be sufficient to bring the employee up to 10 years, or 15 years, of service.
If the claim for credit for additional service is made by an employee who has at least 10 years of railroad service but
is claiming credit for at least 15 years, the Board will not delay the establishment of an extended benefit period based
on 10 years of service but shall extend the ending date of such period if the employee is able to establish credit for
15 years of railroad service.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effective date
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An employee acquires 10 years, or 15 years, of railroad service, as the case may be, as of the first day with respect
to which creditable compensation is attributable in his 120th, or 180th, month of service.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Defined
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. An extended benefit period consists of seven consecutive 14-day registration periods in the case of an employee
having 10&hyph;14 years of railroad service and 13 consecutive 14-day registration periods in the case of an employee
having 15 or more years of railroad service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Beginning date
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In the case of unemployment benefits, an extended benefit period begins with the first day of unemployment after
the day on which the employee exhausts his or her rights to normal unemployment benefits. In the case of sickness benefits,
the beginning date is the first day of sickness after the employee exhausts normal sickness benefits. Such first day
of unemployment or first day of sickness must be within the same benefit year with respect to which the employee exhausted
normal unemployment or normal sickness benefits, as the case may be. However, no extended benefit period may begin
on any day of unemployment or sickness prior to the date on which the employee acquired 10 years of railroad service.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ending date
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If an employee has 10 but less than 15 years of railroad service, his or her extended benefit period ends on the 97th
day after it began. If an employee has 15 or more years of railroad service, his or her extended benefit period ends on
the 181st day after it began. If an employee attains age 65 during an extended sickness benefit period, such extended
benefit period will terminate on the day next preceding the date on which the employee attains age 65, except that it
may continue for the purpose of paying benefits for his or her days of unemployment, if any, during such extended benefit
period. If an extended sickness benefit period terminates because the employee has attained age 65 and if at that point
the employee has rights to normal sickness benefits, the employee will be paid normal sickness benefits if he or she
is otherwise entitled to payment thereof.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Maximum number of compensable days
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. During an extended benefit period consisting of seven consecutive 14-day registration periods, extended benefits
may be paid for a maximum of 65 days of unemployment (or 65 days of sickness, as the case may be). During an extended benefit
period consisting of 13 consecutive 14-day registration periods, extended benefits may be paid for a maximum of 130
days of unemployment (or 130 days of sickness, as the case may be).

How to claim extended benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An employee who has 10 or more years of railroad service who exhausts his or her rights to normal unemployment or normal
sickness benefits and who wishes to claim extended unemployment or extended sickness benefits may do so by claiming
benefits on the forms provided by the Board pursuant to parts 325 or 335 of this chapter. The claim forms provided for
this purpose are the same as those provided for claiming normal benefits. No special application for extended benefits
is required, and no waiting period applies to the payment of extended benefits.

 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its general labeling policy for over-the-counter (OTC) drug products
to allow for the interchangeable use of certain words in labeling required by an OTC drug monograph. Examples of these
words include: ``doctor'' and ``physician,'' ``consult'' and ``ask,'' and ``indications'' and ``uses.'' This
final rule provides alternate terminology in the labeling of OTC drug products for words that have the same meaning.

 In the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 5, 1993 (58 FR 17553), the agency proposed to amend its general labeling policy for over-the-counter (OTC)
drug products to allow for the interchangeable use of certain words in the labeling required by an OTC drug monograph.
The agency had previously proposed in a number of tentative final monographs and included in a number of final monographs
a provision that the words ``doctor'' and ``physician'' may be used interchangeably in the labeling of OTC drug products.
(See, e.g., &sect;&sect;333.150(e), 333.350(e), and 336.50(e) (21 CFR 333.150(e), 333.350(e), and 336.50(e)).)
Instead of including this provision in each OTC drug monograph, the agency proposed to include such a provision in
&sect;330.1 (21 CFR 330.1) as part of the general conditions under which an OTC drug is generally recognized as safe,
effective, and not misbranded. The agency also proposed that, at manufacturers' discretion, the word ``ask'' could
be substituted for the word ``consult,'' which appears in the directions for many OTC drug monograph ingredients.
(See, e.g., &sect;&sect;333.150(c)(1), 333.350(c)(2), and 340.50(c)(2) (21 CFR 340.50(c)(2)).) Thus, the agency
proposed that the phrases ``consult a physician,'' ``consult a doctor,'' ``ask a physician,'' and ``ask a doctor''
could be used interchangeably. The agency invited comments and suggestions as to such other terms that could be used
interchangeably, i.e., terms general in nature that appear in more than one OTC drug monograph.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One trade association, representing OTC drug manufacturers, and one drug manufacturer submitted comments in response
to the agency's proposal. Copies of the comments are on display in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305),
Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, and may be seen by interested

I. Summary of the Comments Received
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment from the trade association agreed with the agency's proposal to allow for the interchangeable use of the
words ``doctor'' and ``physician,'' and the words ``consult'' and ``ask.'' The comment suggested the following
additional sets of alternative terms and gave the following citations, showing inclusion in several OTC drug monographs,
as support: (1) ``Clean'' or ``cleanse'' (&sect;&sect;333.150(d), 333.350(d)(1), and 346.50(d)(1) (21 CFR 346.50(d)(1)));
(2) ``persist'' or ``continue'' (&sect;&sect;341.76(c)(5)(ii), 346.50(c)(7)(iii), 357.150(c)(1), and 357.850(c)(1)(i)
(21 CFR 341.76(c)(5)(ii), 346.50(c)(7)(iii), 357.150(c)(1), and 357.850(c)(1)(i))); (3) ``chronic'' or ``persistent''
(&sect;&sect;336.50(c)(1), 338.50(c)(3), 341.74(c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(ii) through (c)(4)(iv), and 341.78(c)(1)
(21 CFR 338.50(c)(3), 341.74(c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4)(ii) through (c)(4)(iv), and 341.78(c)(1))); (4) ``assistance''
or ``help'' (&sect;&sect;331.30(g), 332.30(c), 341.74(f), and 342.76(c)(5)(i) and (c)(6)(ii) (21 CFR 331.30(g),
332.30(c), 341.74(f), and 342.76(c)(5)(i) and (c)(6)(ii))); and (5) ``pulmonary'' or ``lung'' (&sect;&sect;336.50(c)(1)
and 338.50(c)(3)). The comment stated that, in some instances, the paired terms already appear in the cited regulations
and, in other cases, the alternative terms may be better understood by consumers. The comment mentioned the following
examples: ``Lung'' disease may be better understood than the more technical ``pulmonary'' disease, and ``persistent''
may be better understood than ``chronic.'' The comment stated its understanding that the rule is intended only to
provide a glossary of comparable terms that may be used interchangeably, not to make substantive changes in the underlying
required label statements. For example, the comment mentioned that the rule would not permit the term ``health professional''
as an alternative to the terms ``doctor'' or ``physician,'' because a ``health professional'' may include pharmacists,
nurses, midwives, and others who are not licensed to practice medicine. The comment requested that the agency clarify
that this rule applies only to OTC drug monograph language otherwise required to be declared verbatim in OTC drug product
labeling. The comment added that the rule would not apply to or otherwise affect the use of truthful and nonmisleading
alternative terms that can be used for monograph indications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other comment also proposed that the terms ``assistance'' and ``help'' be allowed interchangeably in the general
overdose warning, which states: ``In case of accidental ingestion, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison
Control Center immediately.''

II. The Agency's Final Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has carefully evaluated the comments' proposals for the interchangeable use of certain terms and concludes
that the interchangeable terms suggested by the comments (``clean'' or ``cleanse,'' ``persist(s)'' or ``continue(s),''
``assistance'' or ``help,'' and ``pulmonary'' or ``lung'') are acceptable and will help promote better label readability.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the agency has determined that the terms ``indication(s)'' or ``use(s)'' should be allowed to be used
interchangeably. The agency considers the term ``use(s)'' to be simpler and better understood by consumers than
the term ``indication(s).'' The agency is including this option in &sect;330.1(i).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency disagrees with the interchangeable use of the words ``chronic'' and ``persistent.'' ``Chronic,'' by
definition, is of long duration, or may be subject to habit or disease for a lengthy period (Ref. 1). On the other hand,
``persistent,'' by definition, is refusing to let go, insistently repetitive or continuous, or enduring (Ref. 2).
While ``chronic'' is also ``persistent,'' ``persistent'' is not necessarily ``chronic.'' For instance, a chronic
cough denotes one that has gone on for a lengthy period of time, while a persistent cough could be one of recent onset
that does not respond to treatment. Thus, a chronic cough and a persistent cough may be the same, or they could be two
separate entities. Therefore, interchangeable use of the terms ``chronic'' and ``persistent'' is not included
in the final rule.

This final rule does not make substantive changes in the language required in OTC drug monographs. The rule allows
for alternative terminology for certain terms that are sufficiently comparable to be used interchangeably. The
rule does not affect the use of truthful and nonmisleading terminology as an alternative to monograph indications
in accord with &sect;330.1(c)(2)(ii) and (c)(2)(iii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has examined the economic consequences of this final rule and determined that it does not require either
a regulatory impact analysis, as specified in Executive Order 12866, or a regulatory flexibility analysis, as defined
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). This final rule provides alternative labeling options
that can be implemented at very little cost by manufacturers at the next printing of labels, for those products for
which the manufacturer chooses to make a change. Thus, the rule will have no significant economic impact. The agency
concludes that the final rule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12866. Further, the agency certifies
that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the
Regulatory Flexibility Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 4, 1991 (56 FR 63554), FDA issued a final monograph for OTC dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis
drug products in subpart H of part 358 (21 CFR part 358, subpart H). The monograph lists selenium sulfide 1 percent in
&sect;358.710(a)(5) as an active ingredient that is used for the control of dandruff. The selenium sulfide included
in the monograph is not micronized (reduced to a fine particle size). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 5, 1993 (58 FR 17554), the agency published a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the final monograph for
OTC dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis drug products to include 0.6 percent micronized selenium sulfide
in &sect;358.710(a) as an active ingredient for the control of dandruff. The agency also proposed to add the following
definition for micronized selenium sulfide in &sect;358.703(e): ``Selenium sulfide that has been finely ground
and that has a median particle size of approximately 5 micrometers (&mu;m), with not more than 0.1 percent of the particles
greater than 15 &mu;m and not more than 0.1 percent of the particles less than 0.5 &mu;m.'' Interested persons were
invited to submit written comments and comments on the agency's economic impact determination by June 4, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 No comments were received in response to the proposed amendment. As discussed in the proposal (58 FR 17554 at 17556),
the agency advised that any final rule resulting from this proposed rule would be effective 12 months after its date
of publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Therefore, on or after January 30, 1995, any OTC drug product that is not in compliance with this amendment to the final
rule may not be initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless it
is the subject of an approved application or abbreviated application. Further, any OTC drug product subject to the
rule that is repackaged or relabeled after the effective date of the rule must be in compliance with the rule regardless
of the date that the product was initially introduced or initially delivered for introduction into interstate commerce.
Manufacturers are encouraged to comply voluntarily with the rule at the earliest possible date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 No comments were received in response to the agency's request for specific comment on the economic impact of this rulemaking
(58 FR 17554 at 17557). The agency has examined the economic consequences of this final rule in conjunction with other
rules resulting from the OTC drug review. In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agency announced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.
The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resulting from the OTC drug review do not constitute
a major rule according to the criteria established by Executive Order 12866. The agency therefore concludes that
no one of these rules, including this amendment of the final monograph for OTC dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, and
psoriasis drug products, is a major rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC drug review was not likely to have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354).
That assessment included a discretionary regulatory flexibility analysis in the event that an individual rule might
impose an unusual or disproportionate impact on small entities. However, this particular rulemaking for OTC dandruff,
seborrheic dermatitis, and psoriasis drug products is not expected to pose such an impact on small businesses. This
final rule will not remove any existing products from the market or require any reformulation or relabeling of existing
products. The final rule will increase the scope of active ingredients available to industry for this class of OTC
drug products. This final rule would allow OTC drug products containing 0.6 percent micronized selenium sulfide
and labeled for the control of dandruff to be marketed without having to obtain an approved application, as is currently
required. This will be beneficial to small manufacturers. Therefore, the agency certifies that this final rule will
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

I. Summary of State Submittal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 28, 1984, USEPA informed the Governor of Illinois that the Illinois SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP was inadequate to protect the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in Alton and Wood River Townships
of Madison County, Illinois, and requested that the State submit revisions to the SIP to address the inadequacy. The
determination that the SIP needed to be revised was based on modeling performed by the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency (IEPA) for a regional study which included Madison County. Modeled violations of the NAAQS in Wood River Township
were attributed primarily to the Shell Oil refinery complex in Roxana, Illinois. IEPA was able to demonstrate NAAQS
attainment in the Wood River area through significant emission reductions at the Shell Oil complex. The Shell Oil
emission limits are set forth at 35 Illinois Administrative Code (35 IAC) 214.382, and were submitted to USEPA as a
revision to the Illinois SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP on January 4, 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 24, 1993 (58 FR 15824), USEPA stated that the January 4, 1989 submittal could be approved if Illinois placed
a set of recordkeeping and reporting requirements for enforcement purposes into a federally enforceable State operating
permit for the Shell Oil Company. Operating permits issued under Illinois' federally enforceable operating permit
program, which was approved and incorporated into the Illinois SIP by USEPA on December 17, 1992 (57 FR 59928) at 40
CFR 52.737, are federally enforceable parts of the SIP upon issuance by the State, unless USEPA deems them not federally
enforceable. The USEPA transmitted a list of the necessary permit conditions for Shell Oil in a June 12, 1992 letter
to the State. On November 10, 1992, the Shell Oil Company applied for an operating permit which would include the recordkeeping
and reporting requirements identified by USEPA. On September 1, 1993, a public hearing was held in Wood River, Illinois,
to receive comments on the Shell Oil permit. Shell Oil's operating permit (I.D. Number 199090AAA) was issued on November
2, 1993, in accordance with the requirements of Illinois' federally approved SIP. On December 27, 1993, USEPA determined
that permit number 199090AAA meets the requirements for Federal enforceability. Permit number 199090AAA adequately
addresses the enforceability deficiencies in 35 IAC 214.382 by incorporating the recordkeeping and reporting requirements
included in the June 12, 1992 letter. Because it is federally enforceable, this operating permit supplements Illinois'
January 4, 1989 SIP submittal and renders the January 4, 1989 submittal fully approvable.

Public Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 22, 1993, USEPA received a comment from the Wood River Manufacturing Complex (Shell Oil), which stated that
the Shell Oil Company supports the finalization of USEPA's proposed rulemaking action.

Public Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 23, 1993, USEPA received comments on behalf of the Jefferson Smurfit Corporation (Smurfit), which operates
a facility in Alton Township, Madison County. Smurfit does not appear to object to the substance of the Wood River Township
SIP revision, but believes that USEPA should not approve the January 4, 1989 submittal for Wood River Township until
the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 attainment status of Alton Township has been finalized. Referring to USEPA's September 22, 1992 (57 FR 43846) action,
in which USEPA proposed to redesignate Alton, Granite City, and Nameoki Townships, Madison County, to nonattainment
for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, Smurfit stated that any designation for Madison County regarding SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should be consistent between Alton Township, Madison County, and Wood River Township, Madison County. Smurfit believes
that Alton Township should not be redesignated to nonattainment if Wood River Township is excluded from the nonattainment
area. Smurfit argues that emissions from Wood River Township contribute to ambient SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentrations in Alton Township, and that USEPA's approval of the January 4, 1989 SIP revision should be deferred
until the State determines that the sources in Wood River Township will not interfere with Alton Township's ability
to attain the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ambient standard. Smurfit remarked that it would not dispute USEPA's proposed approval of the January 4, 1989 submittal
for Wood River if Alton Township were to remain designated attainment for SO

USEPA Response:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP was submitted in response to a September 28, 1984 notice of SIP deficiency. The USEPA's approval of the January
4, 1989 SIP revision for Wood River Township addresses this outstanding notice of SIP deficiency for the area. It in
no way precludes USEPA from redesignating Wood River Township to nonattainment for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at a later date, if evidence exists which indicates the necessity for redesignation. Dispersion modeling studies
associated with Illinois' SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP development have shown that sources in Wood River Township are not currently causing NAAQS violations in Alton
Township.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alton Township was initially cited for SIP deficiencies along with Wood River Township on September 28, 1984. On January
28, 1991, USEPA advised the Governor of Illinois that the whole of Madison County should be designated nonattainment
for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In a letter to USEPA dated March 14, 1991, the Governor of Illinois stated that if a nonattainment designation was
necessary pursuant to the 1990 Amendments of the Clean Air Act, only Alton, Granite City, and Nameoki Townships in
Madison County should be designated, rather than the entire county. The Director of the Illinois Environmental Protection
Agency also stated in a separate letter to USEPA dated March 14, 1991 that Illinois' SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP was deficient for these townships. Since 1991, IEPA has worked with Alton Township industries to address SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 attainment issues. IEPA requested that Wood River Township remain attainment for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, since a SIP addressing deficiencies in the area had been submitted on January 4, 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 21, 1993 (58 FR 67334), USEPA published its intent to defer the final designation to nonattainment of these
townships, as the State is working to expeditiously correct the SIP deficiencies. The State submitted a SIP revision
for Alton Township on November 18, 1993. USEPA will take action upon this submittal and make a final determination
of Alton Township's attainment status in a subsequent action.

III. Final Rulemaking Actions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Based on the information contained in the State's January 4, 1989 submittal, and in the federally enforceable operating
permit issued to the Shell Oil Company on November 2, 1993, and in consideration of the public comments received on
USEPA's March 24, 1993 (58 FR 15824) proposed rule, USEPA is approving amendments to 35 IAC 214.102 and 214.382. The
USEPA's approval of these rules satisfies the September 28, 1984 notice of SIP deficiency for Wood River Township,
Madison County, Illinois.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the new rules covering the Shell Oil facility, the January 4, 1989 submittal includes amendments to
Illinois' SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Measurement Methods (35 IAC 214.101) and Incorporations by Reference (35 IAC 214.104). However, further amendments
to 35 IAC 214.101 and 214.104 were submitted to USEPA on February 8, 1991. On December 20, 1991 (56 FR 66003), USEPA proposed
to approve these rules, as submitted on February 8, 1991. On June 26, 1992 (57 FR 28617), USEPA approved 35 IAC 214.101
and incorporated it by reference into the Illinois SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP. The USEPA is taking no action on the version of 35 IAC 214.101 which was submitted on January 4, 1989, since the version
approved on June 26, 1992 supersedes this submittal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. On December 20, 1991 (56 FR 66003), the USEPA proposed to approve 35 IAC 214.104, Incorporations by Reference, which
was adopted by the Illinois Pollution Control Board at 15 Ill. Reg. 1017 and became effective January 15, 1991. No public
comments were received in response to USEPA's proposed rulemaking action. The USEPA is therefore approving the incorporation
of this rule into the Illinois SO

The USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the
waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 26, 1993, EPA published the notice of proposed rulemaking to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP)
revision submitted by the State of Colorado for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Assistance Program (PROGRAM)
in the State. The implementation plan was submitted by the State to satisfy the Federal mandate, found in section 507
of the Clean Air Act (Act), to ensure that small businesses have access to the technical assistance and regulatory
information necessary to comply with the Act. The rationale for the approval was set forth in the proposal. No comments
were received pursuant to this proposed action. Therefore, EPA is proceeding with its approval of the revision to
the Colorado SIP for establishing a PROGRAM in the State.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Implementation of the provisions of the Clean Air Act (Act), as amended in 1990, will require regulation of many small
businesses so that areas may attain and maintain the National ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the
emission of air toxics. Small businesses frequently lack the technical expertise and financial resources necessary
to evaluate such regulations and to determine the appropriate mechanisms for compliance. In anticipation of the
impact of these requirements on small businesses, the Act requires that states adopt a PROGRAM, and submit this PROGRAM
as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
to oversee these PROGRAMS and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM
are set out in section 507 of title V of the Act. In February 1992, EPA issued 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Guidelines for the Implementation of Section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in order to delineate the Federal and state roles in meeting the new statutory provisions and as a tool to provide further
guidance to the states on submitting acceptable SIP revisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State of Colorado has submitted a SIP revision to EPA in order to satisfy the requirements of section 507. In order
to gain full approval, the State submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance
to small businesses; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The establishment of a State Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory
process; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Summary of Submittal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Colorado has met all of the requirements of section 507 by submitting a SIP revision that implements all
required PROGRAM elements. At a public hearing held before the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission (Commission)
on October 15, 1992, the plan for the PROGRAM was approved. A notice of approval dated October 30, 1992, was issued by
the Technical Secretary of the Commission adopting the PROGRAM plan. Legal authority to implement the PROGRAM was
obtained through Senate Bill 105 and is contained in the Colorado Act (ACT) Section 25&hyph;7&hyph;109.2. The collection
of fees to cover the cost of implementing the PROGRAM is contained in the ACT Section 25&hyph;7&hyph;114.7. The Colorado
PROGRAM was submitted to EPA by the Governor of Colorado on November 18, 1992, and was initially reviewed for administrative
and technical completeness. In a letter dated December 23, 1992, EPA requested additional information from the State
in order to make a positive determination on the submittal. After receiving the additional information on January
7, 1993, EPA notified the State in a letter dated January 26, 1993, that the submittal was administratively and technically
complete. The submittal then underwent review by EPA headquarters, and received a concurrence from all reviewers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has met the first PROGRAM element by committing in its PROGRAM plan pages 6 through 9 to meet the six requirements
set forth in section 507(a)(3) for the Small Business Assistance Program. Additionally, a task force has been established
to examine options for implementation of these six requirements, and prepare a report containing its recommendations.
The State has met the second PROGRAM element by locating the position of the Small Business Ombudsman in the Office
of Regulatory Reform, as specified in Section 25&hyph;7&hyph;109.2(5) of the ACT, and by outlining the powers and
duties of the Ombudsman on pages 4 and 5 of its PROGRAM plan. The State has met the third PROGRAM element by establishing
a Small Business Compliance Advisory Panel in the State of Colorado, as specified in Section 25&hyph;7&hyph;109.2(2)
of the ACT, and by outlining in its PROGRAM plan on pages 5 and 6 the functions of the CAP and how the members will be determined,
which is consistent with section 507(e). Additionally, the State of Colorado has established a mechanism for ascertaining
the eligibility of a source to receive assistance under the PROGRAM, including an evaluation of a source's eligibility
using the criteria in section 507(c)(1) of the Act. This mechanism is located on pages 2 and 3 of the State's PROGRAM
plan.

III. Final Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the SIP revision submitted by the State of Colorado. The revision was made to satisfy the requirements
of section 507 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Acting Regional Administrator under the procedures published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years.
The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this action, EPA is approving a State program created for the purpose of assisting small businesses in complying
with existing statutory and regulatory requirements. This program does not impose any new regulatory burdens on
small businesses; it is a program under which small businesses may elect to take advantage of assistance provided
by the State. Therefore, because the EPA's approval of this program does not impose any new regulatory requirements
on small businesses, I certify that it does not have a significant economic impact on any small entities affected.

 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction
from future flooding. Since the communities on the attached list have recently entered the NFIP, subsidized flood
insurance is now available for property in the community.

In addition, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas
in some of these communities by publishing a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The
date of the flood map, if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. In the communities listed
where a flood map has been published, Section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 42 U.S.C.
4012(a), requires the purchase of flood insurance as a condition of Federal or federally related financial assistance
for acquisition or construction of buildings in the special flood hazard areas shown on the map. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director finds that the delayed effective dates would be contrary to the public interest. The Director also finds
that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary.

The Commission, at the request of Quincy Community Radio, allots Channel 240C3 at Quincy, Washington, as its second
local FM transmission service. See 58 FR 46605, September 2, 1993. Channel 240C3 can be allotted to Quincy in compliance
with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements with a site restriction of 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles)
northeast to avoid a short-spacing to Station KLTX, Channel 239C, Seattle, Washington. The coordinates for Channel
240C3 at Quincy are North Latitude 47&hyph;15&hyph;13 and West Longitude 119&hyph;48&hyph;58. Since Quincy is
located within 320 kilometers (200 miles) of the U.S.-Canadian border, concurrence by the Canadian government has
been obtained. With this action, this proceeding is terminated.

The Commission, at the request of Francis G. Toce, allots Channel 293A to Minetto, New York, as the community's first
local aural broadcast service. See 58 FR 26089, April 30, 1993. Channel 293A can be allotted to Minetto in compliance
with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements, with respect to domestic allotments, with a site
restriction of 10.9 kilometers (6.7 miles) northwest, at coordinates North Latitude 43&hyph;24&hyph;40 and West
Longitude 76&hyph;36&hyph;40, to avoid a short-spacing to the pending application for Channel 294C3 at Copenhagen,
New York (BMPH&hyph;930310IB). This allotment is short-spaced to Station CJBC5F, Channel 292B, Peterboro, Ontario,
and to vacant Channel 293A at Brockville, Ontario, Canada. However, Canadian concurrence has been received for the
allotment of Channel 293A as a specially negotiated allotment, since Minetto is located within 320 kilometers (200
miles) of the U.S.-Canadian border. With this action, this proceeding is terminated.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 20, 1994, NMFS published a change in observer coverage for certain participants in the groundfish fishery
of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI). NMFS is suspending until February 13, 1994, the effectiveness of the
requirement for operators of catcher or processor vessels equal to or greater than 60 feet (18.3 m) length overall
(LOA) and less than 125 feet (38.1 m) LOA to have a NMFS-certified observer on board the vessel each day it is used to participate
in a directed fishery for groundfish in statistical area 517 during the period that the 1994 directed fishery is open
for Pacific cod in the BSAI management area. This action is necessary to provide adequate time for operators of catcher
or processor vessels to comply with the new observer requirements.

NMFS published a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 65574, December 15, 1993) for public review and comment that proposed a change in 1994 observer coverage requirements
for vessels participating in a directed fishery for groundfish in statistical area 517 in the BSAI management area.
A rule document implementing this action became effective January 13, 1994, the date of filing with the Office of the
Federal Register (59 FR 3000, January 20, 1994). This action requires operators of catcher or processor vessels equal
to or greater than 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA and less than 125 feet (38.1 m) LOA to have a NMFS-certified observer on board the
vessel each day that it is used to participate in a directed fishery for groundfish in statistical area 517 during the
period that the 1994 directed fishery is open for Pacific cod. Reasons for this action are set forth in the proposed
and final 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 rule documents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 30-day delayed effectiveness period under section 553(d)(3) of the Administrative Procedure Act was waived
for reasons contained in the final rule document implementing the change in observer coverage. NMFS has determined
that not all vessel operators had sufficient notice of the change in observer coverage requirements to obtain a NMFS-certified
observer prior to the January 13, 1994, effective date. Therefore, NMFS is suspending the effectiveness of the requirement
until 12 noon A.l.t., February 13, 1994.

This action is taken under 50 CFR 675.25 and is in compliance with E.O. 12866. Because this action is required to provide
relief to vessel owners who otherwise would be unable to comply with observer coverage requirements, it is unnecessary
and not in the public interest to provide prior public comment under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3). Also, because this action
temporarily relieves a restriction, it is being made effective immediately without a 30-day delay in effectiveness
under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).

 NMFS announces the approval of Amendment 24 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the
Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI) and issues final regulations to implement the amendment that allocates
the Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) among vessels using trawl, hook-and-line or pot gear, and jig gear through
1996. These regulations also authorize seasonal apportionments of the portion of Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels
using hook-and-line or pot gear. Consistent with the regulations implementing Amendment 24, NMFS also specifies
1994 gear allocations and seasonal apportionments of the amount of the 1994 Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using
hook-and-line or pot gear through 1996. This action is necessary to allocate Pacific cod among specified gear groups
to respond to socioeconomic needs of the fishing industry that have been identified by the North Pacific Fishery Management
Council (Council). It is intended to promote management and conservation of groundfish and other fish resources
and to further the goals and objectives contained in the FMP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The domestic groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the BSAI are managed by the Secretary of Commerce
(Secretary) in accordance with the FMP. The FMP was prepared by the Council under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation
and Management Act (Magnuson Act). Regulations authorized under the FMP that pertain to the U.S. groundfish fisheries
appear at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At its June 1993 meeting, the Council adopted Amendment 24 and recommended that NMFS prepare rulemaking to implement
the amendment. A notice of availability of Amendment 24 was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 15, 1993 (58 FR 53497), and invited comment on the amendment through December 7, 1993. No written comments
were received. A proposed rule to implement Amendment 24 was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57803). Comments on the proposed rule were invited through December 6, 1993. Five letters addressing
eight comments were received and are summarized and responded to in the Response to Comments section, below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment 24 was approved by the Secretary of Commerce on January 5, 1994, under section 304(b) of the Magnuson Act.
This amendment establishes FMP authority to allocate the Pacific cod TAC among vessels using different gear types
and to seasonally apportion gear allocations of Pacific cod. Upon reviewing the reasons for Amendment 24, and the
comments on the proposed rule to implement it, NMFS has determined that this action is necessary for fishery conservation
and management and implements the following three measures through December 31, 1996, under authority of Amendment
24.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The BSAI Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) is allocated annually among gear types as follows: 2 percent to
vessels using jig gear; 44 percent to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear; and 54 percent to vessels using trawl
gear. In monitoring the use of these gear allocations, all cod catch and cod bycatch by each of the three gear groups
will be counted against its allocation;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Secretary, after consultation with the Council, is authorized to seasonally apportion the amount of the Pacific
cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear. Seasonal apportionments will be divided among three
seasons of 4 months duration each, and will be established through the annual September-December specifications
process (&sect;675.20(a)). Any seasonal apportionments of the amount of Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using
hook-and-line or pot gear must be based on the following information: (A) Seasonal distribution of prohibited species;
(B) seasonal distribution of Pacific cod relative to prohibited species distribution; (C) expected variations
in Pacific halibut bycatch rates throughout the fishing year; and (D) economic effects of any seasonal apportionment
of Pacific cod on the hook-and-line and pot gear fisheries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director) is authorized to reallocate Pacific cod from vessels using
trawl gear to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and vice versa, anytime during the year the Regional Director
determines that one gear group or the other will not be able to harvest its allocation of Pacific cod. That portion of
the jig gear allocation that is expected to go unharvested may be transferred to vessels using trawl and hook-and-line
or pot gear at the beginning of the third 4-month season.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of the measures implemented under Amendment 24 is to provide stability in the trawl gear and fixed gear (jig,
hook-and-line and pot) fisheries by establishing designated allocations of the Pacific cod TAC among vessels using
these different gear types. Further explanation of, and reasons for, these measures are contained in the preamble
to the proposed rule (58 FR 57803, October 27, 1993).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council recommended proposed 1994 gear allocations and seasonal apportionments of the amount of Pacific cod
allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear at its September 1993 meeting. The proposed specifications
for the 1994 Pacific cod fishery were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public review and comment as part of the proposed rule implementing Amendment 24 (58 FR 57803, October 27, 1993).
At its December 1993 meeting, the Council reaffirmed its September recommendations. NMFS concurs with the Council's
recommendations and has included the final specifications for the 1994 Pacific cod fisheries in this action implementing
Amendment 24 (Tables 1 and 2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with regulations authorizing seasonal apportionments of the amount of Pacific cod allocated to vessels
using hook-and-line or pot gear (&sect;675.20(a)(2)(v)), a discussion of the seasonal apportionments relative
to the seasonal distribution of Pacific cod and prohibited species, prohibited species bycatch rates, and economic
effects on the hook-and-line and pot gear fisheries is presented in the preamble to the proposed rule implementing
Amendment 24 (58 FR 57803, October 27, 1993). In 1994, 1995, and 1996, the proposed and final specifications for Pacific
cod will be established through the annual TAC specification process undertaken by NMFS and the Council during the
September and December Council meetings each year (&sect;&sect;675.20(a)(2) and 675.21(b)(3)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Five letters of comments were received within the comment period that ended December 6, 1993. Four of the letters were
supportive of Amendment 24 and one letter opposed it. A summary of comments and NMFS's response follow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 1.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rule implementing Amendment 24 should include a prohibition against using both trawl and fixed gear onboard a
vessel to fish for groundfish during a year to prevent vessels that use one gear type from gaining access to another
gear type's Pacific cod allocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Limitations on the use of trawl or fixed gear to fish for Pacific cod or other groundfish species are beyond the scope
of Amendment 24 as adopted by the Council and approved by the Secretary. Prohibitions against using more than one gear
type to fish for Pacific cod during a year would require a separate amendment to the FMP and cannot be implemented at
this time.

Comment 2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed 1994 seasonal apportionment of the amount of Pacific cod allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or
pot gear is supported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS is implementing the seasonal apportionment of the amount of Pacific cod TAC that is allocated to vessels using
hook-and-line or pot gear as proposed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment 3.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations implementing Amendment 24 provide an equitable way to manage the Pacific cod fishery to reduce waste,
periods of high bycatch, and gear conflicts. Allocation of Pacific cod among gear types is an important management
measure during the period the Council is developing a comprehensive plan to manage the groundfish fisheries. The
implementation of the amendment should proceed without delay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS concurs. Amendment 24 has been approved and implementing regulations are issued under the schedule set forth
under section 305(a) of the Magnuson Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 4.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Preferential allocation of Pacific cod or other groundfish species to the newly emergent longline freezer fleet
in the BSAI is opposed. The Bering Sea cod fishery was developed by the trawl fleet and criteria historically applied
by the Council in resource allocation issues would favor the BSAI trawl fleet in any cod allocation dispute with longline
vessels. Although the trawl industry generally believes that a 60&hyph;40 split of the Pacific cod TAC between trawl
and fixed gear would more closely reflect current utilization levels, the fixed gear allocation implemented under
Amendment 24 will provide benefits from the stabilization of the trawl and fixed gear fisheries for Pacific cod. Such
stabilization will allow for better and more efficient planning and will enable the trawl and fixed gear fleets to
assure their respective markets of a dependable and predictable supply of product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS recognizes that the development of Amendment 24 and alternatives for allocating Pacific cod TAC among different
gear groups was a contentious issue that required significant input and effort by the industry to help resolve problems
addressed by the Council. NMFS concurs that the fixed allocation of the Pacific cod TAC among gear groups will provide
stability to the Pacific cod fisheries during the period the Council is developing a long-term comprehensive plan
for the management of the Alaska groundfish resources.

Comment 5.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The annual apportionment of the halibut bycatch limit established for BSAI fisheries and seasons should support
the annual seasonal apportionment of Pacific cod. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regulations implementing Amendment 24 do not govern how Pacific halibut bycatch limits are apportioned among fisheries,
although gear specific allocations of Pacific cod will be considered when apportioning prohibited species bycatch
limits among fisheries and seasons during the annual specification process (&sect;675.21(b)(3)). As required
by regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;675.21(b)(3), NMFS will review the seasonal apportionment of the amount of Pacific halibut bycatch mortality
specified for the Pacific cod fisheries when the agency makes a final determination on the 1994 groundfish specifications.

Comment 6.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The trawl industry generally supports Amendment 24 as a management measure that will support the stabilization of
the Pacific cod fisheries provided that the annual process for apportioning the Pacific halibut trawl bycatch mortality
limit among trawl fisheries is not used to undermine the intent of this amendment. Efforts by representatives for
the fixed gear fisheries to restrict the amount of halibut annually apportioned to the Pacific cod trawl fishery would
prevent the trawl gear allocation of Pacific cod from being harvested and result in a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 preferential allocation of cod to the fixed gear fleet. The Council and NMFS must ensure that the annual process for
the apportionment of PSC limits among trawl fisheries does not lead to the instability that Amendment 24 is intended
to avoid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS acknowledges that significant flexibility exists on how PSC limits are annually apportioned among fisheries
and seasons. The resulting apportionments must be justified based on regulatory intent to optimize the harvest of
available groundfish under a given PSC limit (&sect;675.21 (b)(1) and (b)(3)). NMFS believes that the annual prohibited
species bycatch allowances specified for the Pacific cod trawl fishery should be based on anticipated prohibited
species bycatch needs. NMFS has advised the Council that it should consider PSC limit apportionments among fisheries
and seasons that are consistent with regulations implementing Amendment 24. Nonetheless, the PSC limits established
for the BSAI trawl fisheries likely will continue to constrain the ability of trawl fisheries to harvest available
groundfish.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 7.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Amendment 24, as adopted by the Council, did not establish a fixed allocation of the BSAI trawl halibut bycatch limit
to the Pacific cod trawl fishery and the proposed rule did not rectify this omission. This measure is necessary for
reasons stated in Comment 6. The anticipated benefits under Amendment 24 in terms of fishery stability will not be
realized as long as the possibility exists for fixed gear interests to continue to use the annual specification process
to constrain the amount of halibut bycatch apportioned to the Pacific cod trawl fishery, thereby achieving a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 preferential allocation to the fixed gear fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A separate amendment to the FMP would be needed to establish a fixed allocation of the trawl halibut PSC limit to the
BSAI Pacific cod trawl fishery. This measure could not be implemented as a regulatory amendment and included in the
proposed rule to implement Amendment 24. The response to Comment 6 further describes NMFS's position on this issue.
The Council may address this issue in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 8.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pacific cod catch during the duration of Amendment 24 should not be considered in calculating quota shares under any
individual transferrable quota (ITQ) program the Council may adopt in the future because gear allocations of Pacific
cod under Amendment 24 may alter catch patterns or otherwise skew the proportion of Pacific cod harvested by any gear
type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ITQs are not the subject of this rulemaking. The Council and the Secretary have not determined whether access to the
fishery will be controlled, or if a limited access system will be implemented. Once such determinations are made,
eligibility criteria for participation in the fishery will be determined.

(A) The TAC of Pacific cod, after subtraction of reserves, will be allocated 2 percent to vessels using jig gear, 44
percent to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and 54 percent to vessels using trawl gear. The Regional Director
may establish separate directed fishing allowances and prohibitions authorized under paragraphs (a)(8) and (a)(9)

(B) If during a fishing year the Regional Director determines that vessels using trawl gear or hook-and-line or pot
gear will not be able to harvest the entire amount of Pacific cod allocated to those vessels under paragraph (a)(2)(iv)
of this section, then NMFS may reallocate the projected unused amount of Pacific cod to vessels harvesting Pacific
cod using the other gear type(s) through publication in the

In the publications of proposed and final harvest limit specifications required under &sect;675.20(a) of this part,
the Secretary, after consultation with the Council, may seasonally apportion the amount of Pacific cod TAC allocated
to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear under paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of this section among the following three periods:
January 1 through April 30; May 1 through August 31; and September 1 through December 31. The Secretary will base any
seasonal apportionment of the Pacific cod allocation for vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear on the following
information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Seasonal distribution of Pacific cod relative to prohibited species distribution; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Any amounts of the nonspecific reserve that are apportioned to Pacific cod as provided by paragraph (b) of this section
must be apportioned between vessels using jig, hook-and-line or pot, and trawl gear in the same proportion specified
in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, unless the Regional Director determines under paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)
of this section or paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(C) of this section that vessels using a certain gear type will not be able to
harvest the additional amount of Pacific cod. In this case, the nonspecific reserve will be apportioned to vessels
using the other gear type(s).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the final monograph for over-the-counter (OTC) antihistamine
drug products to include the ingredient doxylamine succinate. FDA is issuing this final rule after considering extensive
information concerning this ingredient and the recommendations of its Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee
(NDAC), which met on June 28, 1993, to consider potential labeling for doxylamine succinate regarding the results
of toxicology testing conducted under the National Toxicology Program (NTP). This final rule is part of the ongoing
review of OTC drug products conducted by FDA.

 of September 9, 1976 (41 FR 38312), FDA published, under &sect;330.10(a)(6) (21 CFR 330.10(a)(6)), an advance notice
of proposed rulemaking for OTC cold, cough, allergy, bronchodilator, and antiasthmatic drug products. In that notice,
the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Cold, Cough, Allergy, Bronchodilator, and Antiasthmatic Drug Products (the Panel)
recommended that doxylamine succinate be generally recognized as safe and effective (Category I) as an OTC antihistamine
at a dosage level of 7.5 to 12.5 milligrams (mg) (41 FR 38312 at 38385 through 38387). At that time, the agency concluded
that doxylamine succinate should remain a prescription drug at dosage levels above 7.5 mg because it causes a high
incidence of drowsiness compared to other OTC antihistamines (41 FR 38312 at 38313). Subsequently, after evaluating
extensive data on the safety of doxylamine succinate, the agency determined that doxylamine succinate could be marketed
OTC at the Panel's recommended dosage. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 24, 1987 (52 FR 31892 at 31893 through 31903), the agency proposed monograph status at dosages of 7.5 to 12.5
mg. No comments were received in response to this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1991, the agency received a report of a study on doxylamine succinate conducted by the National Center for Toxicological
Research (NCTR) (Ref. 1). The results of this study were under consideration when the agency published the final monograph
on OTC antihistamine drug products on December 9, 1992 (57 FR 58356). Accordingly, the agency deferred a decision
on doxylamine succinate at that time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NCTR technical report concerns a 2-year carcinogenicity and chronic toxicity study of doxylamine succinate
in Fischer 344 rats and B6C3F1 mice. The study was conducted under the auspices of the NTP. The study was prompted by
the National Cancer Institute's finding that methapyrilene, a similar antihistamine, is a potent liver carcinogen
in the rat (Ref. 2). Methapyrilene was removed from the market in 1979. The NCTR study on doxylamine succinate was reviewed
by the agency's Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (the P-A Committee) on June 13 and 14, 1991 (Ref. 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NCTR study (Ref. 1), doxylamine succinate was administered, ad libitum, as an admixture in the feed to male and
female rats at dose levels of 0, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 parts per million (ppm) for 2 years. Mice of both sexes received
food containing dose levels of 0, 190, 375, or 750 ppm. Each group contained 48 weanling animals per sex; the animals
were scheduled for sacrifice at the end of 104 weeks. An additional group of animals (9 rats and 12 mice per sex) in each
dose group was sacrificed at the end of 65 weeks. There were no significant treatment-related differences in survival
in either rats or mice. In rats, the highest doxylamine succinate dose group had final body weights that were 22.8 percent
(females) and 8.4 percent (males) lower than controls. A number of nonneoplastic lesions was observed in rats, including
fatty change, degeneration, and hyperplasia of the liver and increased cytoplasmic alteration in the salivary glands.
In mice, there was evidence of hepatotoxicity including hypertrophy, clear and mixed cell foci, and, in females,
fatty change. There also was a treatment-related increase in ``atypical'' hepatocytes in male mice. Both male and
female mice had a dose-related increase in thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia. There was a positive trend for increased
incidence with increasing dose for both hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in male rats. When the incidence
of adenomas and carcinomas was combined, the statistical test was positive (p &lt; 0.01) and the incidence in the highest
dose group was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased over that of controls. No treatment-related increase in neoplasms
was found in female rats. Although not statistically significant, one rat in each of the high dose groups of male and
female rats was found to have a pineal gland tumor, which is an extremely rare neoplasm in rats. In mice, doxylamine
succinate administration produced an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenoma in both males (p &lt; 0.001)
and females (p &lt; 0.001). Also, there was an increased incidence of follicular cell adenoma of the thyroid gland
in male (p &lt; 0.05) and female (p &lt; 0.0001) mice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the rodent tumorigenicity studies were positive, doxylamine succinate tested negative overall in in vitro
tests for genotoxic activity (causing damage to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)). Based on the overall assessment,
the tumorigenic responses observed in the rodent bioassays may relate to secondary mechanisms involving the induction
of liver microsomal enzymes, cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, promotion of tumor potential in pre-existing susceptible
cells, or other processes. Such mechanisms may represent species-specific effects or threshold phenomena applicable
to rodents (under the conditions of the bioassay), but these mechanisms are considered of questionable significance
in humans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to uncertainty concerning the relevance of these findings to human use, the agency asked its P-A Committee and
a number of consulting experts to evaluate the data and to advise the agency on whether doxylamine succinate should
continue to be marketed OTC. By a vote of five to one, the P-A Committee concluded at its June 13 and 14, 1991, meeting
that doxylamine succinate is not likely to have human carcinogenic potential. Again, by the same vote, the P-A Committee
recommended that doxylamine succinate could remain OTC, but that consumers should be alerted that these data exist.
The P-A Committee discussed labeling as a preferred means of providing this information (Ref. 3, pp. 175 through 182).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA subsequently developed possible labeling that could be used. This labeling included the warning: ``Use of this
product may be hazardous to your health. This product contains doxylamine succinate which has been determined to
produce tumors in laboratory animals.'' The agency requested the views of a national trade association of OTC drug
manufacturers on this suggested warning (Ref. 4). In response, the association asserted that such a warning would
be inappropriate (Ref. 5). The association stated that such a warning: (1) Would not ensure safe and effective product
use by consumers; (2) is not based on sound scientific data known to be relevant to the human condition; (3) is not understood
and actionable, in a meaningful way, by consumers; and (4) might reduce the impact of other warnings and occupy scarce
label space.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The association argued that the proposed warning does not meet the criteria of section 502(c) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 352(c)). This part of the statute requires labeling information to be presented
in ``terms as to render it likely to be read and understood by the ordinary individual under customary conditions of
purchase and use.'' The association contended that the proposed warning effectively shifts the burden of determining
product safety from the agency to the consumer and then does not tell the consumer what action to take. In a subsequent
communication (Ref. 6), the association further argued that a warning statement in the labeling of doxylamine products
is not justified because the scientific data do not suggest a significant risk to humans, that such a warning would
be unprecedented, and that a label warning is not the appropriate means for disclosing this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992, the agency established a new advisory committee specifically for the review of OTC drugs, the Nonprescription
Drugs Advisory Committee (NDAC). The agency asked NDAC to consider the issue of a tumor statement in the labeling of
OTC drug products containing doxylamine succinate at its June 28, 1993, meeting. The agency presented a summary of
the NCTR data, possible labeling, and legal and compliance issues (Ref. 7). Other interested parties presented their
positions. The agency asked NDAC to consider the following questions: (1) Should a labeling statement be used to inform
consumers in place of other alternative approaches (no warning, prescription only status, removal from all marketing,
etc.)? (2) Is there a desirable risk-to-benefit relationship for labeling? (3) If the answer to both questions is
yes, what information should be included in the labeling and what language should be used that would be easily understood
by the average consumer? (4) How should information be presented to the consumer (i.e., under the ``Warning'' or some
other heading, visible at the point of purchase, on the immediate container, or in a package insert) and should the
information indicate that the product could be ``hazardous'' to health? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the available evidence, NDAC voted unanimously (10 to 0) to reaffirm the P-A Committee's recommendation
that doxylamine succinate remain OTC. NDAC also recommended (10 to 0) that there be no specific statement about tumors
in the labeling and urged FDA to write a fully descriptive article on the subject in the ``FDA Consumer'' magazine.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has considered the two advisory committees' recommendations and concludes that doxylamine succinate
is safe and effective for OTC use as an antihistamine. Accordingly, the agency is including doxylamine succinate
in the final monograph for OTC antihistamine drug products. The agency is also developing an ``FDA Consumer'' article
and has issued a talk paper concerning the NCTR findings in animals to inform consumers of these data and the uncertainty
of their relevance to humans.

The agency has examined the economic consequences of this final rule and has determined that it does not require either
a regulatory impact analysis, as specified in Executive Order 12866, or a regulatory flexibility analysis, as defined
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). This rulemaking for OTC antihistamine drug products is
not expected to have an impact on small businesses. Doxylamine succinate remains available OTC. No product reformulations
will be required. Some minor relabeling will be necessary to meet the conditions of the final monograph. Manufacturers
will have 1 year to implement this relabeling. Thus, the impact of the final rule appears to be minimal. Therefore,
the agency concludes that the final rule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12866. Further, the agency
certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is removing the exemption for certain drugs limited by new drug applications (NDA) to prescription sale
in &sect;310.201(a)(13) (applicable to doxylamine succinate preparations) because most portions of that exemption
are superseded by the requirements of the antihistamine final monograph (21 CFR part 341). Section 310.201(a)(13)
does not apply to the use of doxylamine succinate as a nighttime sleep-aid, for which an NDA is required for marketing.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is revising the existing SSIG Program regulations to implement statutory changes required by the Higher
Education Amendments of 1992, enacted July 23, 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;325) (1992 amendments), which amend the HEA.
These revised regulations also change the SSIG Program regulations to reduce burden and clarify existing rules.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SSIG Program provides financial incentives for States to establish and to maintain financial assistance programs
that make grants and provide work-study assistance to students with substantial financial need. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SSIG Program supports National Education Goal 5, which calls for every adult American to be literate and possess
the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of
citizenship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 2, 1993, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for this program in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 36110). The major issues addressed by the proposed regulations are discussed in the preamble to the NPRM. There
are two major differences between the NPRM and the final regulations. The first change is to revise the allotment formula
above the ``hold-harmless'' allotment of Federal funds each State received in fiscal year 1979 under the SSIG Program.
The ``hold-harmless'' amount of Federal funds is the SSIG Program allotment each State received in fiscal year 1979.
Under section 415B(a)(1) of the program statute, if an appropriation exceeds the fiscal year 1979 appropriation,
each State still would continue to receive at least its ``hold-harmless'' amount regardless of the results of the
allotment formula. Based on the comments received, a change was made in the final regulations to revise the allotment
formula above the ``hold-harmless'' level by redefining the term ``deemed eligible.'' The Secretary determines
the number of students ``deemed eligible'' to participate in a State's SSIG Program by dividing the amount of each
State's SSIG expenditures, including both its Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching the
allotment, by the average grant award per student of all participating States. The Secretary determines the ``average
grant award per student'' by dividing the total number of student recipients for all States into the total amount of
SSIG expenditures for all States, including both the Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching
the allotment. In making this determination, the Secretary uses the most recently available data reported by each
State. The Secretary will allot additional SSIG funds to States above their ``hold-harmless'' amounts by using the
following steps: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Calculate the States' number of students ``deemed eligible'' to participate in a State's SSIG Program by dividing
the amount of each State's SSIG funds expenditures, including both its Federal allotment and the State-appropriated
funds matching the allotment, by the average grant award per student of all participating States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Calculate the States' projected allotments by dividing each State's number of students ``deemed eligible''
by the total number of students ``deemed eligible'' for all States, and then multiply that number by the appropriation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Compare each State's projected allotment calculated in step 2 to its ``hold-harmless'' amount and select only
States where the projected allotment exceeds the ``hold-harmless'' amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For the States selected in step 3, calculate the amount the Secretary will allot above the ``hold-harmless'' amount
to each of these States by dividing each of the selected State's number of students ``deemed eligible'' by the total
``deemed eligible'' students for all of the selected States and then multiply that number by the amount of the appropriation
above the total ``hold-harmless'' amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other change under &sect;692.41(b) provides that, upon a showing of good cause, the Secretary may approve a State's
definition for ``independent student'' that varies from that term as defined in section 480(d) of the HEA.

Comment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: Three commenters agreed with the revision in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;692.10(b) of the proposed regulations to redefine students who are ``deemed eligible'' to participate in
the SSIG Program as students who were reported by the State as SSIG recipients in the most recently available performance
report data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters objected to the use of State-reported SSIG recipients in the most recently available performance
report data as students who are ``deemed eligible'' to participate in the SSIG Program. These commenters believed
that the number of recipients could be easily manipulated by States by inflating the number of awards to students.
Rather than provide substantial awards to the most needy students, States could inflate the number of students deemed
eligible by providing smaller awards to a larger number of students in order to receive a larger share of program funding
above the hold-harmless amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters believed that the current allotment formula for awarding SSIG funds above the hold-harmless amount
should not be amended. These commenters felt that the current allotment formula based on the enrollment data for each
State is more objective and meaningful in distributing funds for the SSIG Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters recommended that the allotment formula above the hold-harmless level should be based on the amount
of funds actually expended by each State to match its Federal allotment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
: The Secretary is amending the current allotment formula for awarding funds above the hold-harmless level because
it does not conform to section 415B(a)(1) of the HEA. Section 415B(a)(1) was amended by the Higher Education Amendments
of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;498), but the SSIG Program regulations were not amended to conform with this statutory change.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary is changing the allotment formula for funds above the hold-harmless level to one that counts, for purposes
of making allotments to States, the number of students ``deemed eligible'' to participate in a State's SSIG Program
as determined by the following formula. The Secretary divides the amount of each State's SSIG expenditures, including
both its Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment, by the average grant award per
student of all participating States in the most recent award year as reported by the State. The Secretary determines
the ``average grant award per student'' by dividing the total number of student recipients for all States into the
total amount of SSIG expenditures for all States, including both the Federal allotment and the State-appropriated
funds matching the allotment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the past, the Secretary has provided extreme flexibility to States in implementing the SSIG Program statute. It
is the Secretary's experience that mere head counts do not accurately reflect the participation of States in the joint
Federal-State SSIG Program. Moreover, this change responds to the concerns raised by some commenters that States
might manipulate a head-count of recipients and the concerns raised by other commenters that funding should be based
on the actual matching expenditures of the States. Furthermore, the Secretary collects the Federal and State SSIG
funding data and average grant award per student from each State's most recent SSIG Program performance report. By
using the most recently available performance report data, the States will not be required to conduct a new data collection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 415B(a)(1) of the program statute, this formula would be used only if an appropriation exceeds the fiscal
year 1979 appropriation. Each State still receives at least its ``hold-harmless'' amount. The Secretary believes
that by considering the amount of State SSIG expenditures in the calculation of the number of students ``deemed eligible,''
States are provided with incentive to increase the amount of funds they allocate to their SSIG Programs. In this way,
States that provide more State dollars will receive more Federal SSIG funds above the ``hold-harmless'' amount,
the allotment each State received in fiscal year 1979 under the SSIG Program. For States to exceed the allotment of
funds beyond the ``hold harmless'' amount, States would have to elect to include more of their State grant funds under
the SSIG Program in their calculation under &sect;692.10(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that the change encourages the inclusion of additional State funds in the SSIG Program and,
as a result, would stabilize the grant funds available to students from the States. The Secretary also believes that
the revised formula provides for the best use of Federal funds under the program by: (1) Rewarding States that have
made a strong commitment of their State grant funds to the SSIG Program as reflected by the States' amount of State grant
funds; and (2) encouraging States to maintain or expand their commitment of their level of expenditures for State
grant programs.

&sect;692.10(b) to provide that the Secretary determines the number of students ``deemed eligible'' to participate

and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment, by the average grant award per student of all participating
States. The Secretary determines the ``average grant award per student'' by dividing the total number of student
recipients for all States into the total amount of SSIG expenditures for all States, including both the Federal allotment
and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment. In making this determination, the Secretary uses the most
recently available data reported by each State.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If there is a fee for submitting and processing the State information on a form to make a determination of financial
need under the SSIG Program, the fee must be payable to the State regardless of whether the information may also be used
for institutional aid. In the case of a decentralized State grant program under which institutions participating
in the State's SSIG Program award State grant funds, funds awarded under these programs are still considered to be
State aid and not institutional aid. It is the responsibility of each State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that institutions participating in the State's SSIG Program conform with this requirement.

 Section 692.21(g) provides that, if a State awards grants to independent students or to students who are less-than-full-time
students enrolled in an institution of higher education, a reasonable portion of the State's allocation must be awarded
to those students. The Secretary believes that in order to provide the States with the maximum amount of flexibility
under this provision, no specific parameters for the term ``reasonable'' should be provided. The Secretary on a case-by-case
basis, if necessary, will determine the reasonableness of the allocation.

 A few commenters believed that under &sect;692.21(g), the Secretary requires that a State must award SSIG Program
grants to independent students or to students who are less-than-full-time students in reasonable proportion to
the State's allocation of SSIG Program funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter believed it was unwise to reserve a portion of very limited need-based grant aid for less-than-full-time
students because of the overwhelming numbers of very needy full-time students who cannot be served due to lack of adequate
funding.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 692.21(g) provides that, if a State awards grants to independent students or to students who are less-than-full-time
students enrolled in an institution of higher education, a reasonable portion of the State's allocation must be awarded
to those students. Neither the program statute nor &sect;692.21(g) requires a State to award grants to independent
students or students who are less-than-full-time. If the State's allocation from the Secretary is based on a formula
that includes the financial need of students who are independent or attend an institution less-than-full-time,
then the State must ensure that those students receive a reasonable proportion of SSIG funds.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters objected to the proposed requirement in &sect;692.41(b) that States use the term ``independent
student'' as defined by section 480(d) of the HEA in a State's own need-analysis system or a need-analysis system combining
the State's system with the Federal system under part F of title IV of the HEA in order to obtain the Secretary's approval
of the State's system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters believed that the use of the Federal definition infringes upon the State's right to set priorities
for administering State grant funds and would limit the State's flexibility in awarding these funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters also believed that they should have the flexibility to use their own State statutory or regulatory
definition of ``independent student'' and report any variance with the Federal definition on the State's annual
application to participate in the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter was concerned that, if the regulations are adopted as proposed, the States should be given an opportunity
to amend their statutory or regulatory definitions of ``independent student'' to conform with the Federal definition
by making the effective date of the provision begin with the 1995&hyph;96 award year. This effective date would provide
the States with time to amend their statutory or regulatory independent student definitions to conform with the Federal
definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter was concerned regarding whether the students selected for SSIG matching purposes by a State would reflect
the proportion of independent students in the State program. The commenter believed that the Secretary could achieve
the intent of the Higher Education Amendments of 1992 by allowing States to submit changes to their applications and
programs. Each State's application would specify the proportion of independent students as defined in the State's
approved need-analysis system which are in the base used to allocate funds and the means by which the State would ensure
a proportionate distribution of SSIG Program funds to independent students.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Discussion:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary agrees with the concerns raised by commenters who believed that the proposed requirement in &sect;692.41(b)
would create difficulties for some States in administering the SSIG Program. The Secretary, therefore, is revising
&sect;692.41(b) to provide that, upon the review and approval of the Secretary, a State may use its own definition
for ``independent student'' that varies from the Federal definition of the term as defined in section 480(d) of the
HEA. The Secretary will approve a variant definition on a case-by-case basis. States that wish to use a variant definition
of ``independent student,'' other than the Federal definition, must provide information concerning their ``independent
student'' definition at the time of application for program funds that includes a justification, with accompanying
supporting documentation, demonstrating ``good cause'' as to why the Secretary should approve the variant definition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that States that have a valid reason to use a different independent student definition should
be accommodated, as long as the use of a different definition is reasonably justified and does not place significant
additional reporting burdens on applicants. The Secretary believes that a valid reason for requesting a variance
might include that excessive costs to the State are incurred in implementing the Federal definition. The Secretary
will also take into consideration in approving a definition the extent to which the new definition imposes additional
data requirements beyond those provided for by the Federal definition and the Federal Need Analysis Methodology
authorized under part F of title IV of the HEA. For example, a State, rather than adopt a new definition, may decide,
with the Secretary's approval, to use the Federal definition except for the professional judgment provision in section
480(d)(7) of the HEA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also agrees with the concerns raised by a commenter regarding whether a State, in selecting students
for the SSIG Program matching purposes, would accurately reflect the proportion of independent students to all students
in the State program. The Secretary believes that the State SSIG Program student funding should be comparable to the
overall State program, if the entire State program is not contained in the State SSIG Program. However, the Secretary
does not wish to place any unnecessary burdens on States. Therefore, the Secretary is providing a new paragraph (j)
in &sect;692.21. Under &sect;692.21(j) the proportion of SSIG Program funds awarded to independent students, including
both the Federal allotment and the State funds matching the allotment, must be, to the extent practicable, the same
proportion of funds awarded independent students as is in the State program or programs of which the State's SSIG Program
is a part.

Changes:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two changes have been made. The Secretary amends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;692.41(b) to provide that he may approve, on a case-by-case basis, the use of a definition of ``independent
student'' that varies from the term defined in section 480(d) of the HEA if a State demonstrates ``good cause'' as to
why a variance should be approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary also amends &sect;692.21 by adding a new paragraph (j) to provide that, to the extent practicable, the
proportion of the funds awarded to independent students in the SSIG Program shall be the same proportion of funds awarded
to independent students as is in the State program or programs of which the State's SSIG Program is a part.

In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed regulations in this

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Based on the response to the proposed regulations and on its own review, the Department has determined that the regulations
in this document do not require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other
agency or authority of the United States.

(b) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary determines the number of students ``deemed
eligible'' to participate in a State's SSIG Program by dividing the amount of that State's SSIG expenditures, including
both its Federal allotment and the State-appropriated funds matching the allotment, by the average grant award per
student of all participating States. The Secretary determines the ``average grant award per student'' by dividing
the total number of student recipients for all States into the total amount of SSIG expenditures for all States, including
both the Federal allotments and the State-appropriated funds matching those allotments. In making this determination,
the Secretary uses the most current available data reported by each State.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commanding Officer of the Naval Weapons Station requested the Corps to establish a restricted anchorage area
(identified as Fallbrook), offshore of Camp Pendleton, San Diego County, California. In accordance with Naval Sea
Systems Command, OPS Volume 1 Manual, Ammunition and Explosives Ashore Safety Regulations for Handling, Storing,
Production, Renovation, and Shipping, a safety distance of 9,000 feet to inhabited structures is required for the
anticipated net explosive weight of 5,500,000 pounds. During loading/unloading, vessel traffic and anchorage
would be restricted to a distance not closer than 5,400 feet from the vessel. The Fallbrook anchorage site has been
intermittently utilized in the past and its use needs to be continued in support of replenishment operations associated
with the transfer of ordnance from the Fallbrook Annex to and from naval combatants and ammunition ships. The Navy's
utilization of this anchorage is expected to grow to a maximum of 10 days per month. This planned long-term utilization
for replenishment operations necessitates establishment of the restricted anchorage. The Corps Los Angeles District
Engineer issued a public notice on June 2, 1993, which solicited comments on this proposed restricted area to all known
interested parties. The District did not receive any objections to the establishment of the restricted anchorage
area. There also were no comments received in response to the interim final rule and accordingly, the rule is adopted
without change.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is issued with respect to a military function of the Defense Department and the provisions of E.O. 12866
do not apply. These rules have been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354), which requires
the preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis for any regulation that will have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small businesses (i.e., small businesses and small government) jurisdictions. There
is no anticipated navigational hazard or interference with existing waterway traffic. There are no recreational
or commercial fishery operations presently in or using the waters within this area because of ongoing military operations.
Therefore, no loss of resources or use of resources would be borne by the public. Therefore, it has been determined
that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and that preparation
of a regulatory flexibility analysis is not warranted.

 This proposed rule would change the boundaries of five of the seven districts established under the Watermelon Research
and Promotion Plan (Plan) to apportion membership on the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board). This action
is necessary to reflect shifts in production since the original districts were established. The Plan requires the
periodic realignment of the districts based on shifts in production to ensure equitable representation of producers
and handlers on the Board.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule is issued under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan (Plan) (7 CFR part 1210). The Plan is
authorized under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act (7 U.S.C. 4901&hyph;4916), hereinafter referred to
as the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive
effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable
conflict with this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section
1650 of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision
of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification
of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition.
After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the
United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction
to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date
of the entry of the ruling.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural
Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small
businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 750 watermelon handlers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5,000 watermelon producers in the contiguous 48 States of the United States who are subject to the Plan. Small agricultural
service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of
less than $3,500,000 and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000.
The majority of watermelon handlers and producers may be classified as small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator of AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(40 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements contained in the Plan have previously been approved
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0093, except for the Board nominee
background statement form which is assigned OMB number 0505&hyph;0001. This action adds no additional reporting

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Plan, the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) administers a nationally coordinated program of
research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon's position in the market
place and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for domestic watermelons. This program is financed by assessments
on all producers, except those persons engaged in the growing of less than five acres of watermelons, and handlers
of watermelons. The Plan specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and submitting both the producer
and handler assessments to the Board, reporting their handling of watermelons, and maintaining records necessary
to verify their reportings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Membership on the Board is determined on the basis of two producers and two handlers for each of seven districts established
under the Plan. The districts are required to have approximately equal annual production volume. The initial (and
current) districts were based on a three-year average production derived from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
Crop Production Annual Summary Reports for 1979, 1980, and 1981. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Plan provides that two years after its effective date (June 8, 1989) and at least every five years thereafter, the
Board should review the districts to determine whether realignment of districts is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When making such reviews, the Plan specifies that the Board should consider such factors as the most recent three-year
USDA production reports or Board assessment reports, if USDA production reports are unavailable, shifts and trends
in quantities of watermelons produced, and any other relevant factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Plan further specifies that, as a result of such reviews, the Board may realign the districts subject to the approval
of the Secretary. Any such alignment should be recommended by the Board at least six months prior to the date of the call
for nominations and should become effective at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 days prior to such date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Plan, the Board appointed a subcommittee to review production and assessment collections
in the current districts. During the review, the subcommittee used USDA and State production and marketing reports,
as well as data derived from Board assessment reports and field notes. The subcommittee focused on information collected
between 1990 and 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the available information, the subcommittee recommended that the boundaries of Districts 3 through
7 be changed and that Districts 1 and 2 remain unchanged. In order for each district to represent approximately 3 million
hundredweights of annual watermelon production, the subcommittee's recommendation would: move Mississippi from
District 5 to District 3; move Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee from District 5 to District 4; move Wyoming, Montana,
Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, and California north of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernadino counties
from District 7 to District 5; move Arkansas and Louisiana from District 5 to District 6; and move New Mexico from District
5 to District 7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The subcommittee's recommendation was approved by the Board's executive committee, and the full Board voted by mail
ballot. In the mail ballot, 19 members voted ``yes,'' 4 members voted ``no,'' and 5 members did not return a ballot.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this proposal would realign the districts as follows:

The Board has recommended that the new districts become effective for the three-year term of office which begins on
January 1, 1995. If adopted, this proposal would affect the eligibility of three current Board members and could necessitate
Board member nomination meetings for Districts 4, 5, 6, and 7 in spring 1994. In the normal cycle of nominating approximately
one-third of the Board members each year, spring 1994 nomination meetings were already planned for Districts 2 and
3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, if this proposal is adopted, it will be necessary to make a conforming change to &sect;1210.401. Section
1210.401 currently states that the districts are defined in &sect;1210.320 of the Plan. Since, this rule would define
new district boundaries in a new &sect;1210.501, this rule would also change &sect;1210.401(b) to reflect this new
section number.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 14, 1990 (55 FR 33246), FDA issued a final monograph for OTC wart remover drug products (21 CFR part 358). The
final monograph included in &sect;358.110(c) (21 CFR 358.110(c)) products containing 15 percent salicylic acid
in a karaya gum, glycol plaster vehicle. Such products were included in the monograph based on the agency's evaluation
of data from three clinical studies (Ref. 1) (see comment 13, 55 FR 33246 at 33253). The directions for such products
were included in &sect;358.150(d)(3) (21 CFR 358.150(d)(3)), as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
``Wash affected area.'' (Optional: ``May soak wart in warm water for 5 minutes.'') ``Dry area thoroughly.'' (If appropriate:
``Cut 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plaster to fit wart.'') ``Apply medicated plaster at bedtime, leave in place for at least 8 hours; in the morning, remove
plaster and discard. Repeat procedure every 24 hours as needed (until wart is removed) for up to 12 weeks.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In discussing the labeling for these products (also in comment 13), the agency stated:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If there are any special directions that relate to using a particular product, then such information should appear
as part of the manufacturer's additional directions for the product. The monograph provides the minimum directions
necessary for use of the product. Manufacturers may supplement these directions with additional information necessary
to use their specific product. For example, the agency notes that the manufacturer's directions for its specific
product include statements to ``keep plastic film on the top of pad facing up and to apply sticky bottom side to the wart.''
The agency finds no need to include such directions in this final monograph; however, manufacturers may add such information,
as appropriate, to the labeling of their products.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequently, the agency became aware that a manufacturer of this product had the following additional statements
in its product's labeling (Ref. 2): (1) ``Smooth wart surface with emery file supplied,'' and (2) ``Apply a drop of
warm water to the wart, keeping the surrounding skin dry.'' The agency has rereviewed the clinical studies (Ref. 1)
for this product and determined that this additional labeling information is based on the manner in which the clinical
studies were performed. The agency notes that use of an emery file and application of a drop of warm water to the wart
site as part of the directions for this type of product were not included in the labeling suggestions made by the manufacturer
when the final monograph was being prepared (see comment 13).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is concerned that similar products in the marketplace may have different directions_some recommending
use of an emery file and a drop of warm water to prepare the wart site and others not mentioning use of an emery file and
a drop of warm water. The agency believes this situation could lead to consumer confusion. (Although the agency is
aware of only one such marketed product, this does not rule out small volume operations and private label products.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The clinical studies (Ref. 1) did not show that using an emery file and a drop of warm water were necessary to prepare
the wart site before application of the medicated plaster. However, these studies also did not show that these procedures
were not necessary, that any adverse effects occurred, or that any interference with the product's safety and effectiveness
occurred when an emery file and a drop of warm water were used. Because the procedure used in the studies included the
use of an emery file and a drop of warm water, the agency has determined that these items should be part of the directions
for this product. The agency is also making a minor format revision in one sentence of the directions. Accordingly,
the agency is proposing to amend the directions in &sect;358.150(d)(3) for 15 percent salicylic acid in a karaya gum,
glycol plaster vehicle, to read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
For products containing salicylic acid identified in &sect;358.110(c).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``Wash affected area.'' (Optional: ``May soak wart in warm water for 5 minutes.'') ``Dry area thoroughly. Gently
smooth wart surface with emery file supplied.'' (If appropriate: ``Cut plaster to fit wart.'') ``Apply a drop of warm
water to the wart, keeping the surrounding skin dry. Apply medicated plaster at bedtime and leave in place for at least
8 hours. In the morning, remove plaster and discard. Repeat procedure every 24 hours as needed (until wart is removed)
for up to 12 weeks.''

The agency has examined the economic consequences of this proposed rulemaking in conjunction with other rules resulting
from the OTC drug review. In a notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 8, 1983 (48 FR 5806), the agency announced the availability of an assessment of these economic impacts.
The assessment determined that the combined impacts of all the rules resulting from the OTC drug review do not constitute
a major rule according to the criteria established by Executive Order 12866. The agency therefore concludes that
no one of these rules, including this proposed rule amending the final monograph for OTC wart remover drug products,
is a major rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic assessment also concluded that the overall OTC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug review was not likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined
in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). That assessment included a discretionary regulatory flexibility
analysis in the event that an individual rule might impose an unusual or disproportionate impact on small entities.
However, this particular rulemaking for OTC wart remover drug products is not expected to pose such an impact on small
business. The final rule may require some very minor relabeling; however, such relabeling should be a one time nominal
cost. The agency is currently aware of only one such product in the marketplace, and it already has this labeling. Other
manufacturers who may market this product will have 1 year after publication of the final rule to implement this labeling.
The cost to do so will be minimal. Therefore, the agency certifies that this proposed rule, if implemented, will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency invites public comment regarding any substantial or significant economic impact that this rulemaking
would have on OTC wart remover drug products. Types of impact may include, but are not limited to, costs associated
with relabeling or repackaging. Comments regarding the impact of this rulemaking on OTC wart remover drug products
should be accompanied by appropriate documentation. The agency will evaluate any comments and supporting data that
are received and will reassess the economic impact of this rulemaking in the preamble to the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may, on or before March 29, 1994, submit written comments on the proposed regulation to the Dockets
Management Branch (address above). Written comments on the agency's economic impact determination may be submitted
on or before March 29, 1994. Three copies of all comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one
copy. Comments and objections are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document
and may be accompanied by a supporting memorandum or brief. Received comments may be seen in the office above between
9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this action, the USEPA is proposing to disapprove the revision to Minnesota's State Implementation Plan (SIP)
for sulfur dioxide (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) for the Dakota County/Pine Bend area of Air Quality Control Region 131. Assuming no other substantive, adverse public
comments are received, the USEPA will proceed with a final approval of the submittal when the Minnesota Pollution
Control Agency (MPCA) addresses the concerns detailed in this notice and submits the Administrative Orders to USEPA
before the end of the 30-day comment period. The USEPA's action is based upon a revision request which was submitted
by the State to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act. The revisions are the result of a call for SIP revision
issued by USEPA on December 5, 1984, based on monitored violations. The revisions in the Minnesota submittal are in
the form of non-expiring Findings and Orders for Koch Refining Company and Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit, Continental Nitrogen
and Resources Company, and Northern States Power Company&hyph;Inver Hills Generating Facility.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USEPA published the designation of Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) 131 as a primary nonattainment area for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 3, 1978, and October 5, 1978. In response to Part D requirements of the Clean Air Act, Minnesota Pollution Control
Agency (MPCA) submitted a final SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for AQCR 131 on April 8, 1981 (46 FR 20996). On December 5, 1984 (49 FR 47488), USEPA issued a call for SIP revisions for
the Minnesota SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP for Dakota County declaring the SIP inadequate based on 1982 monitored violations. The SIP call required that
the MPCA submit a revision to the Twin Cities SO

 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) in the Pine Bend Area by September 1985.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The promulgation of a Good Engineering Practice stack height rule, along with difficulties negotiating a control
strategy with Koch Refining Company, and the selection of an appropriate computer model, delayed the submittal.
On September 10, 1987, the MPCA submitted revisions to the operating permits for five sources and requested redesignation
to attainment for all of AQCR 131 except the Pine Bend and St. Paul Park areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of numerous USEPA comments, MPCA withdrew the Pine Bend SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 revisions for AQCR 131. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 3, 1992, USEPA received from MPCA a revision to the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 plan for the Dakota County/Pine Bend area of AQCR 131. The submittal consisted of administrative materials demonstrating
that the State had adopted the revision as required and that a public hearing was held. The submittal also contained
administrative orders and technical support for Koch Refining Company and Koch Sulfuric Acid Plant, Continental
Nitrogen and Resources Corporation, and Northern States Power-Inver Hills Generating Facility. The rest of AQCR
131, including the St. Paul Park Area, are being addressed in separate rulemakings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 16, 1993, USEPA received an amendment to the original administrative order for Koch Refining Company.
The amendment revises the completion dates for construction and operation of a new stack and control equipment.

II. Analysis of State Submittal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section will provide a review of:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The attainment demonstration modeling methodology for the sources in the area;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Specific aspects of the administrative orders (AOs); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether the submittal meets the requirements of section 172 of the Clean Air Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Modeling Methodology
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The short-term dispersion modeling was performed using the Industrial Source Complex Short-term (ISCST version
90346) model. Dispersion modeling for annual impacts was performed using the Industrial Source Complex Long-Term
(ISCLT version 90008) model. All modeling was conducted in accordance with applicable guidance in the ``Guideline
on Air Quality Models (Revised) (1986),'' and ``Supplement A (1987).'' The dispersion modeling reflects USEPA Good
Engineering Practice stack height regulations where applicable. The modeling also incorporated urban dispersion
coefficients using 1973&hyph;1977 Minneapolis/St. Paul hourly surface meteorological data and St. Cloud mixing
height data. These years were used to maintain consistency with the original SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP. Although there is no reason to believe the 1973&hyph;1977 meteorological data is not representative of current
meteorological conditions in the Dakota County area, it is suggested that future SIP revision modeling incorporate
the five most recent years of available meteorological data, as is stated in the guidance. Combined SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 impacts resulting from modeling Koch Refinery, Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit, Continental Nitrogen Resource Corporation,
and Northern States Power, were calculated at 549 receptors, with model resolution ranging from 1,000 meters near
grid boundaries to 100 meters near hotspot locations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Screening modeling was used initially to identify all events with the potential for an exceedance of the Ambient Air
Quality Standards. These critical events were further processed using refined modeling techniques to determine
if the NAAQS for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 were protected. Several operating scenarios were modeled. The highest, second-highest predicted concentrations
for the 3-hour and 24-hour averaging times, including background, were 965.1 and 361.6 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, respectively. Annual average impacts were predicted by using a refined modeling approach. The maximum annual predicted
concentration, including background, was 69.1 &mu;g/m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional short-term modeling investigated interstate impacts at distances between 10 and 50 km from an MPCA monitor
site. The Wisconsin border is approximately 25 km to the east of the Koch Refinery facility. Modeling was performed
using worst-case emission parameters. The modeling results demonstrated that Dakota County SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions do not prevent attainment or maintenance of the NAAQS in any other State.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
General Statutory Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this section is to discuss whether the submittal meets the statutory requirements set forth in the Clean
Air Act. The Pine Bend area of Dakota County, Minnesota is designated nonattainment for the primary NAAQS for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As a result, SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area plans must meet the requirements of subpart 1 of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, particularly
section 172(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(1) states that part D plans must require reasonably available control measures (RACM), (e.g., RACT).
The definition of RACT for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is that control technology which is necessary to achieve the NAAQS. The Minnesota submittal includes modeling which,
if comments are adequately addressed, demonstrates that the Pine Bend area of Dakota County will achieve attainment
of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS with the control measures fully implemented by April 1, 1993. This satisfies the RACM requirements of the Clean
Air Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(2) states that plans shall require reasonable further progress. The term ``reasonable further progress''
is defined in section 171(B)(1) as ``such annual incremental reductions in emission of the relevant air pollutant
as are required by this part or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment
of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable data.'' The Minnesota submittal provides for attainment of the NAAQS by
April 1, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(3) requires a suitable emission inventory. A suitable inventory of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions in the Pine Bend nonattainment area was provided in Appendix D of the submittal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(4) mandates that any stationary source growth margin included in the submittal be expressly identified
and quantified. The submittal provides for a zero growth margin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(5) mandates a suitable permit program for new and modified major stationary sources. A new source
permitting program for nonattainment areas has been submitted to USEPA by MPCA and is currently undergoing review.
It will be addressed in a separate rulemaking. The Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program is delegated
to Minnesota and a general permitting rule has been SIP approved.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(6) requires enforceable limitations sufficient to provide for attainment. Some enforceability
concerns associated with the submittal are detailed in the next section. If these concerns are adequately addressed,
the limitations will be sufficient to provide for attainment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(7) mandates satisfaction of section 110(a)(2). A primary requirement of section 110(a)(2) is that
the State adopt its limitations following a suitable opportunity for public comment. The MPCA certifies that a public
hearing was held on May 27, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(8) states that the Administrator, in some circumstances, may allow the use of equivalent modeling
emission inventory and planning procedures. In the Dakota County submittal, no ``equivalent techniques'' were
used for modeling, emission inventory, and planning procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(9) requires the plan to provide for implementation of specific measures to be undertaken if the area
fails to make reasonable further progress, or to attain the primary NAAQS by the attainment date applicable under
this part (i.e. contingency measures). In the event of nonattainment of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The Rosemount CNRC facility has three boilers which discharge SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions into the atmosphere. The Company is required to limit emissions of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from each of the 3 emission points to 1.5 pounds of SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per million British Thermal Units (lbs/mmBTU). In addition, the three boilers may not operate at a heat input greater
than that listed in Exhibit 1 of the AO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Company is authorized to burn only natural gas and #6 fuel oil in the three boilers. The Company may not burn #6 fuel
oil with greater than 1.5 percent sulfur by weight. Other restrictions include a limit of no more than 16,000 gallons
of #6 fuel oil per 24-hour period (midnight to midnight), no more than 70,833 gallons of #6 fuel oil per month on a monthly,
12-month rolling average, and the Company cannot burn #6 fuel oil at more than two of the boilers at any one time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the limitations shall be demonstrated through sampling and analyzing the #6 fuel oil for sulfur content
and heating value in accordance with approved ASTM methods. Also the Company shall measure the total gallons of #6
fuel oil burned at each emission unit. The Company is required to keep appropriate records to allow for determination
of compliance with the order.

2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per million British Thermal Units (lbs/mmBTU). None of the limits have an averaging time associated with them. This
leads to the assumption that the limits exist on an instantaneous basis. If this is the case, the administrative order
should state as such. Otherwise, other appropriate averaging times should be applied to the emission limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative order, Part V.B.2.b.1 &amp; 2, states, in part, that the Company must retain records containing
information on sulfur content and heating value. The administrative order must include a formula to relate this information
to the emission limit in order to determine compliance.

/mmBTU from each of the 6 emission units. Also, the Company may not operate the 6 gas turbines at greater than the rated
heat input described in Exhibit 1 of the AO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Company is authorized to burn only distillate and residual fuel oil in each of the gas turbines, and the fuel oil
sulfur content may not exceed 1.0 percent by weight. In addition, the Company may not burn more than 8.75 million gallons
of fuel oil per month on a 12-month rolling average.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the limitations shall be demonstrated through either sampling and analyzing the fuel for sulfur
content and heating value in accordance with approved ASTM methods, or obtaining and retaining a fuel supplier certification.
Also, the Company is to measure the total gallons of fuel oil burned at each emission unit both on a 3-hour basis, and
a monthly, 12-month rolling average basis. The Company is required to keep appropriate records to allow for determination
of compliance with the order.

The emission limits in the administrative order are written as lbs/mmBTU. None of the limits have an averaging time
associated with them. This leads to the assumption that the limits exist on an instantaneous basis. If this is the case,
the administrative order should state as such. Otherwise, other appropriate averaging times should be applied to
the emission limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Company is required to keep records on percent sulfur of the fuel, and heating value of the fuel. The administrative
order, Part IV.B.2.a., does not specify a formula which would convert this data to a lbs/mmBTU basis. This is necessary
since the emission limits are in lbs/mmBTU units. A formula is also required in the Annual Reports section of the administrative
order (Part V.B.).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part of the demonstration of compliance with emission and operating limits involves obtaining and maintaining a
fuel supplier certification. The administrative order, Part I.D.1.a.4., states that the certification must include
the method used to determine the sulfur content of the fuel oil. It must be made clear that the method used must be an approved
ASTM method as listed in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method 19, &sect;5.2.2.

The AO for Koch Refining includes a compliance schedule for required modifications at various locations around the
facility. Each modification activity is accompanied by completion dates. All of the activities had been completed
at the time the submittal was sent to USEPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emission limits for the Refinery are listed in the AO and cover the Sulfur Reduction Unit (SRU) 1/2 facility, the
Sulfur Reduction Unit 3 and 4 facility, the Sulfur Reduction Unit 5 facility, the FCC facility emission points 5, 6,
and 8, the Oil Separation and Waste Treatment Plant (OSWTP), the Platformer facility, and the Powerformer facility.
The table lists emission limitations for each applicable SO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 standard averaging time, 3-hour, 24-hour, and annual. The 3-hour average is based on three consecutive one-hour
periods, the 24-hour is based on 24 consecutive one-hour periods, and the annual is based on a 12-month rolling average.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emission limits for the Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit (KSAU) facility are listed in Table 3 of the AO and cover Absorber
emission points numbers 1 and 3. However, emission point 1 becomes inoperational when emission point 3 begins operation.
Again, the applicable averaging times are based the same as for the Refinery limits mentioned above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Koch Refinery may burn refinery fuel oil, from the refinery fuel oil distribution system, only at select locations.
The fuel oil limits on quantity and sulfur content are specified in Table 2 and Table 2a of the AO. The Refinery may burn
refinery fuel gas at specified locations. The Company may not put fuel gas into the refinery fuel gas distribution
system which contains greater that 0.10 grains of hydrogen sulfide per dry standard cubic foot of gas. The diesel fuel
used shall not have a sulfur content greater than 0.1 percent by weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fuel restrictions at the KSAU facility limit the Boiler to burning only refinery fuel gas, propane, or commercial
natural gas. The hydrogen sulfide content of refinery fuel gas burned at KSAU cannot exceed 0.10 grains of hydrogen
sulfide per dry standard cubic foot of gas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with the various limitations and restrictions applied to Koch Refinery are detailed in the AO. The compliance
demonstration include calculations, monitoring, record keeping, diesel fuel certification, and stack tests.
Compliance with the emission limits at KSAU also consist of calculations, monitoring, and data and record keeping.

Flares nos. 5, 6, and 7 may only use gases from Refinery operations when the gases are from pressure relief, from upsets
of Refinery process equipment, or are required for equipment maintenance (Part II.B.6.C.). At all other times the
flares must burn natural gas. Information must be provided to justify not limiting these sources and not including
them in the modeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance for emission points 348, 458, and 459, is to be based on initial stack tests as specified in Table 1, note
#4. Some method needs to be specified for determining future compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The administrative order states in Part V.C.2. that the company shall conduct performance stack tests to determine
compliance with the emission limitations and fuel restrictions outlined in the order as required by the Commissioner.
Stack tests must also be able to be required by appropriate USEPA personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Exhibit 2&hyph;page 3 discusses the startup incinerators for SRU 3 and SRU 4. These startup incinerators operate
when tail gas bypasses the Shell Claus Offgas Treatment (SCOT) Units and SCOT Unit incinerators. Information must
be provided to justify not limiting or modeling these emission sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On page 9 of Exhibit 2, emission point 17 is listed as an active emission source. However, in Exhibit 2, Attachment 6
emission point 17 has a rated input of 0.0 mmBTU/hr. Also, emission point 17 was not included in the modeling demonstration.
If #17 is shutdown, it must be removed from reference in the administrative order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On page 8 of Exhibit 5, the Company is required to measure the amount of hydrogen sulfide in sour water tank purge gas
by analysis once per calendar quarter. The limit on hydrogen sulfide in sour water tank purge gas is 162 parts per million
as a 3-hour average. We would request than analysis be conducted with increased frequency (e.g., daily).

III. Proposed Rulemaking Action and Solicitation of Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The USEPA is proposing disapproval of the Minnesota SIP revision for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the Dakota County/Pine Bend area of AQCR 131, contained in the Administrative Orders for Koch Refining Company
and Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit, Continental Nitrogen and Resources Company, and Northern States Power Company&hyph;Inver
Hills Generating Facility. However, if the above comments, detailed in this notice, are adequately addressed in
revisions to this plan, and those revisions are submitted to USEPA by the end of the 30-day comment period, then, assuming
no other substantive, adverse public comments are received, USEPA will proceed with a final rulemaking approving
the SIP revision as a whole including the supplemental submittal. If at the end of the 30-day comment period, the issues
are still unresolved, final rulemaking disapproving the SIP revision will be promulgated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on USEPA's proposal to disapprove. Public comments
received by February 28, 1994, will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989, (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years.
USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary
waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866
which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small
entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises,
and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The USEPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act does not
affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in
place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its state-enforceability.
Moreover, USEPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA certifies
that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because
it does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt regulations to ensure the safe processing and importing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and fishery products (hereinafter referred to as seafood). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These procedures include the monitoring of selected processes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles. HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be used by food processors and importers. FDA is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations because a system of preventive controls is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most effective and efficient way to ensure that these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are safe.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of these proposed regulations is to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory preventive controls to ensure the safety of seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products sold commercially in the United States and exported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abroad. These preventive controls will be based on a system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known as HACCP. HACCP is a system by which food processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers can evaluate the kinds of hazards that could affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their products, institute controls necessary to keep these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards from occurring, monitor the performance of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls, and maintain records of this monitoring as a matter of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routine practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require that domestic and foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and importers adopt HACCP controls to prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurrence of hazards that could affect the safety of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood products for consumers. If these regulations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted, FDA will review the adequacy of HACCP controls as part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its program of mandatory inspections and import examinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a review will occur in addition to traditional inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. FDA is also encouraging, but not proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require, that processors and importers adopt the same types of controls for nonsafety hazards relating to economic
adulteration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to make HACCP mandatory for the seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Adoption of HACCP controls by the seafood industry, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coupled with inspections by FDA based on the HACCP system, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce a more effective and more efficient system for ensuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the safety of seafood products than currently exists. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current inspection system places too great a burden on Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspectors to uncover problems and to take regulatory action to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address those problems. HACCP places primary responsibility upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the industry to demonstrate that hazards are understood and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being prevented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A nationally mandated HACCP system will provide a basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for enhanced consumer confidence in the safety of seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. Consumers should not be afraid to eat foods, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood, that are recommended as useful lower fat and lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
saturated fat substitutes for higher fat meats (Ref. 1, p. 13; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ref. 2, p. 21). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The know-how for applying HACCP to seafood is in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advanced state of development. A considerable amount of work on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying HACCP to seafood has already been done by some States, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academia, and the Federal Government as well as through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperative activities between the Federal Government and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry and through independent industry efforts.

4. Seafood industry representatives have urged the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Government to institute a mandatory, HACCP-type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection system for their products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. A nationally mandated HACCP-type system of controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appears to be a prerequisite for continued access to world 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
markets.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ensuring the safety of seafood presents special challenges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to both the industry that produces it and to Government agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
charged with protecting the public health. Seafood is unique in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many respects. While often thought of as homogeneous in nature, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood is actually a variety of products encompassing literally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundreds of species that have little in common other than an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aquatic origin. Collectively, seafoods have perhaps the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diverse and complex microbiology of any food commodity (Ref. 3, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
p. xi). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The range of habitats for edible species is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extraordinary and diverse ranging from cold to warm water, bottom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dwelling to surface feeding, deep sea to near shore, and fresh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water to saltwater. Fish are exposed to the bacteria and viruses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that naturally occur in their environment as well as to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that enter the water through pollution. Chemicals, some of which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are toxic to humans, can accumulate in fish as well. Fish can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also accumulate natural toxins and parasites that are specific to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marine animals. As a consequence, fish are subject to a wide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of hazards before harvest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. The Safety Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The question of how safe is the seafood in the marketplace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been the subject of public debate in recent years. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debate has occurred partly because precise data on the numbers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and causes of foodborne illnesses in the United States do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist. Foodborne illnesses tend to be significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underreported to public health authorities. Data on foodborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses that are meaningful from an epidemiological standpoint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are difficult and expensive to develop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) compiles data in its Foodborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disease Surveillance System that are reported from State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local health authorities. All foodborne illnesses are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underreported to this system (Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, CDCP data are the best available and can at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least be used to identify trends and emerging concerns about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various diseases (Ref. 5, p. 219). The data suggest that most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood-related illnesses result from certain natural toxins in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finfish and from viruses in molluscan shellfish consumed raw or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partially cooked (Ref. 4). The wide range of other hazards that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can affect seafood undoubtedly result in illnesses, but the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available data indicate that such illnesses are not as common. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, according to the CDCP data, the actual occurrence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems tends to be limited relative to the range of hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that could cause problems and tends to be associated with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minority of commercially available species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the CDCP system, seafood accounted for 4.8 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported cases of foodborne illness for the period 1973 to 1987 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 4). However, as CDCP has pointed out, variations in rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of underreporting among different foods and varying etiologies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make it impossible to compare safety among different foods based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solely on CDCP data (Ref. 4). This is certainly true for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood. Some seafood-related illnesses tend to be overreported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to CDCP's system relative to other foodborne diseases, due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largely to their distinctive characteristics, while others are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probably underreported relative to other causes because they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less distinctive and more difficult to diagnose (Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has attempted to determine the relative safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood through risk assessment. The results of this effort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicate that the risk of illness associated with molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish consumed raw or partially cooked is greater than for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any cooked flesh food. However, seafood overall is as safe or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safer than other flesh foods in terms of frequency of illness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 5, p. 25; and 6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conclusions of the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Institute of Medicine, in its 1991 report entitled ``Seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Safety,'' are consistent with the CDCP data and the FDA risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment. According to NAS, ``Most seafoods available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. public are wholesome and unlikely to cause illness in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer'' (Ref. 7, p. 1). Moreover, in reviewing the CDCP data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the report noted that the 23 percent increase in seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption in the United States in the 10-year period ending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989 was not accompanied by a concomitant increase in reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood-borne illnesses (Ref. 7, p. 27). Nevertheless, as NAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pointed out, ``there are areas of risk'' (Ref. 7, p. 1). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report addressed at some length virtually every possible risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that could affect seafood and made numerous recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to existing and proposed control measures. NAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended that improvements be made in the present system of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory control (Ref. 7, p. 1) and repeatedly recommended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP controls wherever appropriate. ``Inspection and testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should focus on actual problems (as in HACCP systems),'' NAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded (Ref. 7, p. 16).

1. Bacteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because bacteria either naturally live in, or can survive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in, aquatic habitats, there are a large number of pathogenic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteria that can be found in seafood, particularly molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish. Many of these bacteria are far more harmful to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific human subpopulations, such as the elderly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immunocompromised, or persons with specific underlying diseases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than to the population as a whole. The size of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpopulations is increasing, however. Therefore, concerns about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacterial contamination of seafood, particularly molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish, are increasing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the United States, 4.4 percent of botulism outbreaks have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been attributed to seafood. The predominant type of botulism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organism in aquatic environments is the kind most readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroyed by heat. Thus, many types of processing, if done 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly, can negate the risk of botulism from seafood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, with the trend toward greater use of modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmosphere and vacuum packaging (i.e., packaging that excludes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxygen) to enhance the shelf life and the desirability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated foods, traditional controls need to be enhanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Clostridium botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can grow in the absence of oxygen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other bacteria of concern include 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Listeria monocytogenes,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous foodborne microorganism that is ubiquitous in nature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is commonly found in food processing environments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which is not a marine organism but can contaminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood through improper handling and sanitation practices; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Staphylococcus aureus,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 another pathogen associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation and handling (Ref. 8, pp. 14 and 15).

2. Viruses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several viruses that are infectious to humans enter aquatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitats through sewage. These viruses can concentrate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish and be present and infective even when bacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicators of fecal pollution are absent. Viruses probably cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bulk of seafood-associated disease, particularly the Norwalk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Norwalk-like agents, which are linked to the consumption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated raw or undercooked molluscan shellfish (Ref. 7, p. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Natural Toxins 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Problems associated with naturally occurring toxins in fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been recognized for centuries. Ciguatera poisoning is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perhaps the most significant problem associated with a natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxin. The toxin is produced by microscopic organisms and can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmitted to humans through the consumption of finfish that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have eaten these organisms through the food chain (Ref. 7, p. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
89). The larger, more predacious fish (groupers, snappers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barracuda, amberjack) and reef fish belonging to the crevally or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ulua (Carangidae) family are generally more likely to contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ciguatoxin than other types of fish (Ref. 7, p. 89). Because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxin is heat stable, cooking does not make the fish safe to eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 9, p. 1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On average, 70 cases of ciguatera poisoning are reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annually in the United States and its possessions and territories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 7, p. 89). Deaths are rare, and the acute symptoms of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease are usually of short duration; however, neurological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
symptoms can persist for extended periods. Ciguatera is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographically localized, with the majority of illnesses reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from tropical or subtropical areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other toxins of public health concern include domoic acid, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which was detected in seafood from the U.S. Pacific coast for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first time in the fall and winter of 1991&hyph;1992 (Ref. 10, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
p. 1,113); and saxitoxin, or paralytic shellfish poison, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has periodically made molluscan bivalves toxic and has recently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected Pacific Northwest crab harvests (Ref. 11). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Parasites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Parasites, such as anasakid nematodes (round worms), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
naturally infect certain fish and ocean mammals (Ref. 12, p. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
724). Human parasitic infections almost always occur from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption of raw (sushi, sashimi) or undercooked fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, probably no more than five cases are reported on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average in the United States each year and the likelihood of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurrence is estimated to be very low (Ref. 5, p. 25). Problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with parasites are avoidable through commercial freezing of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw fish before consumption.

5. Chemical Contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The presence of toxic chemicals in the aquatic environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
creates the potential for contamination of seafood products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These chemicals include pesticides; other industrial chemicals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as polychlorinated biphenyls; heavy metals, such as lead, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cadmium, and mercury; and petroleum hydrocarbons.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Marine species, especially deep sea varieties, comprise the majority of seafood consumed in this country. This seafood
has little potential to contain most chemical contaminants at levels of toxicological concern (Ref. 13, p. 6). However,
there are some contaminants that can be present at significant levels, methylmercury in certain species being perhaps
the most notable. Fresh water species, especially nonmigratory bottom feeders, are generally the most exposed to
a variety of chemical contaminants (Ref. 13, p. 6).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Decomposition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finfish are generally regarded as being much more perishable than terrestrial flesh foods (Ref. 14, p. 3). Decomposition
is a problem with seafood products frequently encountered by FDA and is the subject of the majority of regulatory actions
taken by the agency against violative seafood products (Ref. 15). It is largely an economic and aesthetic problem;
however, in some species it can lead to illness because of the formation of scombrotoxin (histamine) during decomposition.
Scombroid poisoning is completely preventable by proper handling, i.e., by proper time and temperature controls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Additional Factors Affecting Safety
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Unlike beef and poultry, seafood is still predominately a wild-caught flesh food that frequently must be harvested
under difficult conditions and at varying distances from processing, transport, and retail facilities. There are
nearly 100,000 vessels in the U.S. fishing fleet alone (Ref. 7, p. 22). These conditions, distances, and duration
of fishing trips, can tax any system of controls designed to ensure safety and prevent spoilage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, several hundred vessels are seagoing processing factories, many of which operate in remote waters.
For regulators, these ships that process at sea can be difficult and expensive to reach while they are operating, and
individual inspectors face hazards such as ship-to-ship transfers on the high seas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There may be as many as 350 commercially marketed species (Refs. 16; and 19, p. 35). Consumer preferences for one species
over another and significant price differences between species can lead to economic fraud through the substitution
of cheaper species for more expensive ones.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike beef and poultry, seafood is subject to significant recreational harvest. Beyond the 15 pounds of seafood
consumed per capita from commercial channels, an additional 4 pounds may be consumed from recreational sources.
Some recreational catch finds its way into commercial channels as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, recreational fishing can have a bearing on the safety of commercial seafood. Commercial fishermen avoid or
are prohibited from harvesting from polluted areas, but recreational fishermen, especially recreational harvesters
of molluscan shellfish, might not be as aware of, or might ignore, local advisories or water closures. Processors
need to be aware of and control the source of their raw materials, and importers must ensure that their shipments are
obtained from acceptable sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional complicating factor in ensuring the safety of seafood is the fact that no other flesh food is imported
in the quantity, or from as many countries, as seafood. Imports include finished products as well as products to be
further processed domestically. Over 55 percent of seafood consumed in this country is imported. It comes from approximately
135 countries. Several of these countries have advance regulatory structures for seafood safety, but many others
are developing nations that lack structures for seafood regulation comparable to those in more developed nations
(Ref. 35, pp. 113 and 114).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it is of utmost importance, that those who handle and process seafood commercially, including importers,
understand the hazards associated with this type of food, know which hazards are associated with the types of products
with which they are involved, and keep these hazards from occurring through a routine system of preventive controls.
The seafood industry, indeed, the food industry as a whole, must be primarily responsible for the safety and quality
of the food that it produces. The regulator's primary role should be to verify that the industry is meeting this responsibility
and to take remedial action when it is not. The alternative of relying solely on Government inspectors to identify
problems and provide solutions would involve enormous costs to the public and would be extremely inefficient, assuming
it could be done at all.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the most part, seafood processors and importers are not required, through licensure or examination, to understand
seafood hazards as a prerequisite to being able to do business. (There are exceptions. A few States, such as Alaska,
do require processors to conform to HACCP as a condition of doing business (Ref. 17).) While many processors and importers
have such an understanding, this knowledge is not universal. It is not unusual for FDA to receive inquiries about safety
requirements and related matters from those who wish to process or import seafood, or who already do, that indicate
a lack of awareness of hazards specific to their products. Most of the industry does not have HACCP-trained personnel,
and many firms lack dedicated quality assurance personnel (Ref. 18, p. 35).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seafood processing in the United States is done by several thousand businesses, many of which are small, old, and family
operated (Ref. 19, p. 35). This situation is in contrast to the beef and poultry industries, in which market share is
concentrated among a small number of large processors. Seafood firms tend to be small, fragmented operations sized
in reference to anticipated benefits, because of the significant, uncontrollable risks involved in this business
(Ref. 5, p. 225). Also, because many harvests are seasonal, many of their operations are intermittent (Ref. 20). The
seasonal nature of the industry can affect worker skills and practices relating to safety, while older facilities
and equipment can be more difficult to maintain in terms of adequate sanitation and proper processing and storage
temperatures (Ref. 20).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. The Need for Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Current Inspection System Is Not Well-Suited to Seafood
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seafood processors are subject to periodic, unannounced, mandatory inspection by FDA. Seafood processors and importers
are also able to purchase inspection services from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) of the U.S. Department
of Commerce. These inspection services have been primarily trade-related, such as grading.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until recently, FDA's overall regulatory program for seafood received slightly over $20 million per year. Because
much of the program involves activities such as research, laboratory analyses, and technical assistance and training
to States, a substantial portion of it has tended to be invisible to the general public. Public interest and debate
tends to focus on the more visible aspects of regulation, primarily inspection. The congressional debate of the past
several years over the adequacy of the Federal regulatory program for seafood has been framed, more often than not,
in terms of the need for mandatory inspection. Traditionally, FDA inspected the equivalent of a quarter of its total
domestic inventory of seafood establishments per year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1990, however, FDA has received significant funding increases for seafood. The current budget of slightly
over $40 million has permitted the agency to increase the frequency of its inspections. It now inspects so-called
high risk processors at least once per year and all others at least biennially. (Because States also inspect processors,
the collective frequency is actually higher.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even so, because of seafood's unique characteristics (e.g., the fact that it is predominantly wild caught and presents
a wide range of possible hazards), it is questionable whether the current regulatory system, which was developed
for the general food supply, is best suited for the seafood industry. The current system provides the agency with a
``snapshot'' of conditions at a facility at the moment of the inspection. However, assumptions must be made about
conditions before and after that inspection on the basis of the ``snapshot,'' as well as about important factors beyond
the facility that have a bearing on the safety of the finished product. The reliability of these assumptions over the
intervals between inspections creates questions about the adequacy of the system, particularly, as the congressional
hearings on the subject over the past several years have shown, for seafood.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's inspections are based upon the regulations on current good manufacturing practice in manufacturing, packing,
or holding human food at part 110 (21 CFR part 110). For the most part, these guidelines consist of broad statements
of general applicability to all food processing on sanitation, facilities, equipment and utensils, processes,
and controls. HACCP-type controls are listed as one of several options available to prevent food contamination (&sect;110.80(b)(13)(i))
but they are otherwise not integral to the guidelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current Federal inspection and surveillance strategies verify the industry's knowledge of hazards and preventive
control measures largely by inference, i.e., whether a company's products are in fact adulterated, or whether conditions
in a plant are consistent with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP). Consequently, the current system places
the burden on the Government to prove that a problem exists rather than on the firm to establish for itself, for the regulator,
and for consumers, that adequate controls exist to ensure safety. The current approach is inefficient and, unless
Government inspections are conducted with some frequency, can lead to conditions that can elevate risk and erode
public confidence. It also has the potential to cause some inequities. While the same standards of adulteration apply
to all products in interstate commerce, processors and importers who use a system of preventive controls coupled
with adequate monitoring must compete against those who do not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A survey conducted by FDA in 1992&hyph;1993 of manufacturers of ready-to-eat seafood products revealed conditions
that strongly suggest the need for a system that emphasizes preventive controls to ensure that products are safe by
design. Ready-to-eat products require special care in processing because they do not require, and are unlikely to
receive, any further cooking by consumers that would destroy pathogenic microorganisms. The survey focused on whether
preventive controls exist rather than on the results of expensive end-product sampling. The agency found that, in
significant measure, firms have not been employing the types of preventive processing steps necessary to ensure
a safe and wholesome product. Some of the preliminary results are as follows (Ref. 21).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Fifty-four percent of the firms that pasteurized products had not established the adequacy of their pasteurization
process to destroy pathogenic microorganisms such as the spores of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 type E, which can cause significant illness and death in humans. The pasteurization process is not simple and must
be done with precision in order to consistently deliver a thermal process that will inactivate the spores of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 type E and prevent recontamination of the product after it has been heat treated. The CGMP at part 110 state that pasteurization
must be adequate. Realistically, the only way for FDA to determine, or at least infer, the adequacy of the process now
is to analyze samples of finished product for the presence of pathogens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Twenty-seven percent of the firms that pasteurized products did not have temperature-indicating devices on their
pasteurizers, and 35 percent did not have temperature-recording devices. Temperature monitoring is essential
to ensure that a thermal process is properly controlled. Part 110 addresses temperature indicating and recording
devices only for refrigeration, while pasteurization involves cooking. A temperature-recording device is important
for purposes of preventive control because it provides a continuous history of the cooking step.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Forty-two percent of firms that pasteurized products did not perform can seam evaluations or performed them less
frequently than every 12 hours. Such evaluations are necessary to ensure that there will not be microbiological contamination
of the finished pasteurized product. FDA's regulations for the processing of low acid canned food (parts 108 and 113
(21 CFR parts 108 and 113)) require such evaluations every 4 hours as an HACCP-type control, but products that need
refrigeration (e.g., pasteurized products) are outside the scope of those regulations. Again, part 110 states only
that the pasteurization process should be adequate. FDA must conduct end-product sampling and analysis to determine,
or at least infer, whether a pasteurization process is adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Forty-three percent of firms that pasteurized products did not perform cooling water sanitizer strength checks
to ensure that the pasteurized product would not be contaminated during this process. The presence of a sanitizer
in the cooling water is important to prevent contamination of the product after pasteurization because during cooling,
some water can be drawn into hot cans. Part 110 does not specifically mention a cooling water sanitizer. The ``adequate''
provision cited above is the closest relevant provision, and FDA must conduct end-product sampling and analysis
to determine, or at least infer, whether a pasteurization process is adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Eighty-four percent of the firms did not monitor the internal temperature of products during the various stages
of processing. Such monitoring is important because time/temperature abuse can result in the growth of pathogenic
microorganisms, decomposition, and, in some cases, the formation of histamine. Part 110 states that all reasonable
precautions should be taken to prevent contamination and recommends temperature control as one type of precaution.
Again, end-product sampling is the only practical way for FDA to measure compliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Fourteen percent of the firms did not have temperature-indicating devices on their finished product coolers,
and 89 percent did not have temperature-recording devices. Part 110 states that processors should have one or the
other but does not specifically require that processors monitor either one. While 14 percent were out of compliance,
most who were in compliance opted for the control that did not provide a continuous record.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Thirty-one percent of the temperature-indicating devices on finished product coolers were more than 5 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F out of adjustment. Fifty-five percent of these were giving readings that were too low. For these, the deviation
would permit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, decomposition, and histamine formation. Part 110 specifically
states that thermometers should be accurate. Five degree deviations are clearly out of compliance. A significant
percentage of firms surveyed were not paying attention to a significant preventive control.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Twenty-three percent of temperature-indicating devices on pasteurizers and 80 percent of such devices on finished
product coolers were never calibrated. Again, part 110 calls for accuracy. The failure to calibrate means that these
firms have no assurance that their devices are accurate. A preventive control is not being applied, and thus a significant
percentage of processors are apparently relying on Government investigators to determine accuracy during inspections.
Also, this deficiency may account in part for the deviations described in section III.A.7. of this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Twenty-nine percent of temperature-recording devices on finished product coolers were never checked for accuracy,
while 34 percent of such devices on pasteurizers and 74 percent on finished product coolers were checked less frequently
than once a month. Temperature-recording devices are easily jarred out of calibration and must be routinely adjusted
to agree with an accurate temperature-indicating device. Thus, they need to be checked for accuracy at least at the
start and the end of each processing day in order to determine whether they remained accurate throughout the day's
production.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Forty-eight percent of the firms cleaned and sanitized the processing equipment less frequently than every 4
hours, while 13 percent cleaned and sanitized less than every 12 hours. Part 110 states that sanitation practices
should occur as frequently as necessary. In order to control salmonella and other undesirable bacteria within a facility,
the frequency should be at least every 4 hours, and more frequently if feasible. This frequency helps reduce the likelihood
that these microorganisms will enter a rapid phase of growth during which their numbers increase logarithmically
(Ref. 22, p. 114; Ref. 23, p. 2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Twenty-two percent of the firms did not perform plant or equipment sanitation audits (i.e., inspections), and
35 percent did not check the strength of hand or equipment sanitizing solutions. These results reveal that a significant
number of plants are not checking up on themselves to ensure that they were doing an adequate job of sanitation. In such
plants, the only check on sanitation is provided by the Government investigators who visit the plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other survey and inspection findings by FDA and others strongly indicate that the seafood industry does not always
operate on the basis of preventive controls. For example, recent FDA and State surveys showed that many processors
of smoked and smoke-flavored fish are operating outside of the parameters that have been demonstrated through scientific
research to be necessary to ensure that the hazard from botulism is adequately controlled. These parameters are process
times and temperatures and salinity levels. A number of firms surveyed did not even know their own operating parameters,
let alone the scientifically established ones (Refs. 24, 25, and 26). For seafood products such as these that require
no cooking by the consumer, preventive measures by the processor to eliminate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 type E to the maximum extent possible are critically important.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Continuous visual inspection of seafood is not a viable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative. Few hazards associated with seafood are detectable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through visual inspection. Moreover, the costs of such a system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would likely exceed the nearly half-billion-dollar public outlay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
now required to operate this kind of system for meat and poultry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another alternative would be to direct significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional resources toward greatly increasing the frequency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's inspection of seafood, as well as increasing the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling, laboratory analysis, and related regulatory activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with respect to seafood. While thousands of samples of domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and imported seafood products are collected each year for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis in FDA laboratories, and these samples are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientifically designed to represent a broad range of products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are generally perceived by the public to represent only a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small fraction of the total poundage of seafood consumed in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country. Substantial new expenditures would be needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase laboratory analyses to nationally statistically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even if the funds for increased inspection and increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling and analysis were available (which they are not), this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach alone would likely not be the best way for the agency to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spend its money to protect the public health. Reliance on end-product testing involves a certain amount of inefficiency
that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can require very large sample sizes to overcome. NAS recently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed that ``the statistical uncertainties associated with lot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling make this an unreliable method for ensuring safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food products *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Ref. 7, p. 283). FDA has traditionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sought to minimize this type of inefficiency by targeting its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efforts based on its experiences, but some inefficiency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unavoidable. NAS recommended the HACCP system as an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 7, p. 283). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Current Import System Is Not Well-Suited to Seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similar considerations apply to imports. FDA does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally inspect processing facilities in other countries to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether seafood products are being prepared, packed, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held there under appropriate conditions. Such inspections are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extremely costly and require an invitation from the foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country. Traditionally, therefore, FDA's primary strategy for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood imports has involved: (1) Reviewing all customs entries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents to determine which imported products to examine or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample; (2) conducting wharf examinations of selected products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on that review; and (3) sampling and laboratory analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One concern about this process that has been voiced with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some regularity in the media, Congress, and elsewhere is that FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physically looks at less than 5 percent of all imports. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figure is somewhat misleading because it refers to seafood lots 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can vary substantially in size. Also, it does not take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account such factors as the representative nature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examinations, FDA's automatic detention program for imports that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires importers of products with a history of problems to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain a laboratory analysis and certification prior to entry, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fact that imports receiving further processing in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States become subject to domestic inspection. Nonetheless, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certainly true that most imported seafood is not physically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampled or examined by a Federal health official. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total number of customs entries for seafood each year is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaching 200,000 (Ref. 27) from about 135 countries (compared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to about 33 countries for beef and poultry (Ref. 28)), and huge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sums of money would be needed to enable FDA to increase its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical examination and sampling program to nationally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistically significant levels. Still, many developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
countries export seafood products to this country, and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory protections tend to be comparatively weak, if they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist at all. Processing conditions in such countries do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always meet U.S. standards for sanitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While many importers are conscientious about the safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of the products that they import, others have little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understanding of potential hazards. The denial of entry of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violative lot may be regarded as simply a cost of doing business, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is offset in many cases by insurance purchased against just 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such an eventuality. Such policies are identified as ```FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rejection' insurance'' and usually the premium is 2 to 3 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the value of the shipment (Ref. 29). It is reasonable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assume that this cost is being passed on to the consumer. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurance also permits importers to buy seafood from foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors without first ensuring that it meets FDA requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i.e., that it is safe, wholesome, and properly labeled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This system leaves much to be desired. It, too, is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``snapshot''-type approach that places a significant burden on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government to uncover problems without fostering or promoting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry responsibility. It lacks the preventive controls that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency has tentatively concluded are the minimum necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure safety. Moreover, it has not provided full public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidence in the safety of imported seafood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Public Confidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Continuing public concerns about the safety of seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide additional evidence that the current regulatory system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not well-suited for seafood. Consumers have become increasingly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned about the effects of pollution on seafood. Medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes washing up on beaches, ocean dumping of toxic wastes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical run-off, and multiple oil spills continually dramatize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fact that bodies of water, no matter how large, can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely affected by human activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Media and other public attention on seafood safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality, and on the adequacy of the current regulatory program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for seafood, has been substantial in recent years, and there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no reason to expect that this attention will decrease. Problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with some seafood products draw attention to, and has tended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raise concerns about, all seafood, a situation that is bad for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers because seafood is a low fat product, and bad for an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry that can ill afford it.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several hearings on the sufficiency and direction of the Federal seafood safety program have been held in both houses
of Congress since in 1989. In addition, numerous bills have been introduced in Congress for the stated purpose of establishing
a Federal program of mandatory inspection of seafood. Different bills passed the House and the Senate in 1990 but were
not reconciled before the end of the 101st Congress. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This legislative activity has tended to reinforce the view that the public is placed at some risk because no Federal
mandatory program for seafood exists. While this view is inaccurate in a number of respects, it is fueled in part by
the notable differences in the frequency with which regulatory agencies inspect the processors of different types
of flesh foods. As stated above, beef and poultry slaughterhouses are subject to continuous visual inspection under
programs operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public concerns about seafood regulation persist despite the recent increases in Federal resources and inspections
for seafood. A major U.S. newspaper recently published an article entitled ``A Sea of Uncertainties,'' which expressed
anxiety about the coverage of seafood inspection. ``The odds are,'' it observed, ``that the bit of fish you cook tonight
got to your table without ever being poked or prodded or even glanced at by a government inspector'' (Ref. 30). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No realistic system, however, could possibly look at every piece of fish. Moreover, in the current budget climate,
improvements in the system for ensuring the safety of seafood will likely have to be qualitative rather than quantitative.
Estimated combined Federal, State, and local outlays for regulatory activities relating to seafood are about $100
million annually (Ref. 31), but pressures to cut back funding exist at all of these levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, the Government must find new approaches to food safety that enable it to become more efficient and minimize costs
wherever possible. A new paradigm is needed for seafood inspection, one that provides an ongoing, scientifically
established system of intensive, preventive monitoring but that does not require undue resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When faced with similar pressures, Canadian health authorities responsible for seafood safety came to the following
conclusion:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the key challenges will be to endure the scrutiny of the informed consumer and demanding marketplace *&blank;*&blank;*.
The Canadian Government, as well as other western governments will be under constant pressure to limit spending as
the aging population places more and more demands on services and as the Federal deficit is addressed. This means inspection
programs cannot expect to have ever increasing resources to meet the challenges of the 1990's. Smarter and more cost
effective ways must be developed to carry out their mandate.

The ``smarter and more cost effective way'' chosen by the Canadians is HACCP.

A. What is HACCP? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control. Its application to food production was pioneered by the Pillsbury
Company (Pillsbury) during that company's efforts in the early 1960's to create food for the U.S. space program. Pillsbury
concluded that then existing quality control techniques could not provide adequate assurance that the food being
produced was not contaminated. The end-product testing necessary to provide such assurance would be so extensive
that little food would be left for space flights. According to Howard E. Bauman: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We concluded after extensive evaluation that the only way we could succeed would be to develop a preventive system.
This would require us to have control over the raw materials, process, environment, personnel, storage, and distribution
as early in the system as we possibly could. We felt certain that if we could establish this type of control, along with
appropriate record keeping, we should be able to produce *&blank;*&blank;* a product we could say was safe. For all
practical purposes, if this system was implemented correctly, there would be no testing of the finished packaged
product other than for monitoring purposes.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the succeeding years, the system devised by Pillsbury has been recognized worldwide as an effective system of controls.
The system has undergone considerable analysis, refinement, and testing. FDA believes that HACCP concepts have
matured to the point where they can be formally implemented for seafood on an industry wide basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP consists first of an identification of the likely hazards that could be presented by a specific product, followed
by the identification of the critical control points in a specific production process where a failure would likely
result in a hazard being created or allowed to persist. These critical control points are then systematically monitored,
and records are kept of that monitoring. Corrective actions are also documented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods (NACMCF), which was established by USDA in
conjunction with FDA at the recommendation of NAS, has developed seven widely accepted HACCP principles that explain
this process in greater detail (Ref. 34). These HACCP principles follow.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Hazard Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first step in the establishment of an HACCP system for a food process is the identification of the hazards associated
with the product. NACMCF defined a hazard as a biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be
unsafe for consumption (Ref. 34, p. 186). The hazard analysis step should include an assessment of both the likelihood
that these hazards will occur and their severity if they do occur. It should also involve the establishment of preventive
measures to control them. To be addressed by the HACCP system, the hazards must be such, according to NACMCF, that their
prevention, elimination, or reduction to acceptable levels is essential to the production of a safe food. Even factors
beyond the immediate control of the processor, such as how the food will be distributed and how it will be consumed,
must be considered because these factors could influence how it should be processed. Hazards that involve low risk
and that are not likely to occur need not be considered for purposes of HACCP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NACMCF has developed numerous issues to be considered during hazard analysis. These issues relate to matters such
as ingredients, processing, distribution, and the ultimate intended use of the product. FDA urges seafood processors
and importers to become familiar with these issues. They include, for example, whether a food contains any sensitive
ingredients that may present microbiological hazards, chemical hazards, or physical hazards; whether sanitation
practices can affect the safety of the food that is being processed; and whether the finished food will be heated by
the consumer. For seafood, this analysis is particularly important because it is consumed raw or partially cooked
to an extent unrivaled for other flesh foods. Examples of seafoods that are consumed in this way include raw molluscan
shellfish, sushi, steamed clams, and cold smoked salmon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Identify the Critical Control Points in the Process
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Points in a manufacturing process that may be critical control points, as listed by the NACMCF, include cooking, chilling,
specific sanitation procedures, product formulation control, prevention of cross contamination, and certain
aspects of employee and environmental hygiene. For example, a cooking step that must be operated at a specific temperature
and for a specified time in order to destroy microbiological pathogens is a critical control point. Likewise, refrigeration
required to prevent hazardous microorganisms from multiplying or toxins from forming is a critical control point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Establish Critical Limits for Preventive Measures Associated With Each Identified Critical Control Point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In essence, this step involves establishing a criterion that must be met for each preventive measure associated with
a critical control point. Critical limits can be thought of as boundaries of safety for each critical control point
and may be set for preventive measures such as temperature, time, physical dimensions, moisture level, water activity,
Ph, available chlorine, or sensory information such as texture, aroma, or visual appearance. Critical limits may
be derived from sources such as regulatory standards and guidelines, literature surveys, experimental studies,
and experts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Establish Procedures To Monitor Critical Control Points
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Monitoring is a planned sequence of observations or measurements to assess whether a critical control point is under
control and to produce an accurate record for future use in verification. NACMCF identifies three main purposes for
monitoring: (1) It tracks the system's operation so that a trend toward a loss of control can be recognized, and corrective
action can be taken to bring the process back into control before a deviation occurs; (2) it indicates when loss of control
and a deviation has actually occurred, and corrective action must be taken; and (3) it provides written documentation
for use in verification of the HACCP plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As NACMCF points out, continuous monitoring is possible with many types of physical and chemical methods. For example,
temperature and time for a scheduled thermal process can be recorded continuously on temperature-recording charts.
When it is not possible to monitor a critical limit on a continuous basis, monitoring intervals must be reliable enough
to permit the manufacturer to determine whether the hazard is under control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Establish the Corrective Action To Be Taken When Monitoring Shows That a Critical Limit Has Been Exceeded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the HACCP system is intended to prevent deviations in a planned process from occurring, perfection is rarely,
if ever, achievable. Thus, NACMCF states that there must be a corrective action plan in place to: (1) Determine the
disposition of any food that was produced when a deviation was occurring; (2) fix or correct the cause of noncompliance
to ensure that the critical control point is under control; and (3) maintain records of corrective actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Establish Effective Recordkeeping Systems That Document the HACCP System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This principle requires the preparation and maintenance of a written HACCP plan that sets out the hazards, critical
control points, and critical limits identified by the firm, as well as the monitoring, recordkeeping, and other procedures
that the firm intends to take to implement the plan. Secondly, this principle requires the maintenance of records
generated during the operation of the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ultimately, it is the recordkeeping associated with HACCP procedures that makes the system work, both from the standpoint
of the HACCP operator (industry) and the regulator. One conclusion in a study of HACCP performed by the Department
of Commerce is that correcting problems without recordkeeping almost guarantees that problems will reoccur (Ref.
35, p. 85). The requirement to record events at critical control points on a regular basis ensures that preventive
monitoring is occurring in a systematic way.

7. Establish Procedures to Verify That the HACCP System Is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This process involves: (1) Verifying that the critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits are adequate to control the hazards; (2) ensuring that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plan is working properly, e.g., that it is being followed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and that appropriate decisions are being made about corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions; and (3) ensuring that there is documented, periodic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revalidation of the plan to make sure that it is still relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to raw materials as well as to conditions and processes in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant. Government regulatory activities also help ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HACCP system is working.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Specific Applications to Seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As NAS has pointed out, most health risks associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood originate in the environment (Ref. 7, p. 1). Many of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these risks are the subject of research by FDA, the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
others. This research is designed both to produce information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will provide a better understanding of the toxins, bacteria, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical contaminants, and other phenomena and to provide a basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for developing more advanced types of controls for them. Within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the limits of existing scientific knowledge, however, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry can and should use HACCP to control the source and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of raw materials based on an understanding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely hazards that need to be prevented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pillsbury team that first applied HACCP to food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production began with a systematic review of raw materials to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that they were not bringing hazards into the plant. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bauman pointed out:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This required the development of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
familiarity with the raw materials that was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not a normal process in food product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development *&blank;*&blank;*. The areas of concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranged from the potential presence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogens, heavy metals, toxins, physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards and chemicals, to the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatments the ingredients might have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received such as pesticide applications or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization step. (Ref. 33, pp. 2 and 3.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While all these areas that were of concern to Pillsbury are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
germane to all seafoods, they certainly cover the range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards to which seafoods are susceptible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the three most frequently reported seafood-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses, two are environmentally related: ciguatera in warm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water reef fish, as described previously, and water-borne viruses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in molluscan shellfish consumed raw and partially cooked. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a rapid test to detect ciguatoxin in fish continues to be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
target of research at FDA and elsewhere, processors and importers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can exercise control by ensuring that they are obtaining fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from responsible sources that are not harvesting from waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where ciguatoxin is being found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ciguatera has been associated with recreational fishing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Processors and importers should address through HACCP any safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations that might exist with the commercial sale of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recreational catch generally, depending upon species and locale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For viruses from molluscan shellfish to be controlled, HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures must be in place to ensure that molluscan shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvested from polluted waters are not entering commerce. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
key safety controls relate to proper refrigeration to keep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially harmful microbes from reaching dangerous levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third seafood-related illness, scombroid poisoning, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused by a toxin created as part of the process of decomposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after a fish has died. The formation of scombrotoxin can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triggered by time/temperature abuse anywhere in the commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system and beyond, including as early as on the harvesting vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if good handling controls are not followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is considering whether to develop good handling practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements (not necessarily HACCP) specific to fishing vessels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and invites comment on this matter. FDA has traditionally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrained from directly regulating fishing vessels, largely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the huge number of such vessels in the U.S. fleet, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even though it has authority to do so. FDA invites comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether those boats that harvest scombrotoxin-forming species, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any other specific component of the fleet, should be subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory HACCP controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Meanwhile, processors and importers of scombrotoxin-forming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species can exercise HACCP controls aimed at ensuring that their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incoming raw materials or imported shipments have not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature abused. Because any HACCP plans for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors or importers would be clearly inadequate if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombrotoxin were not identified as a hazard and appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls were not in place and systematically monitored, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and importers should consider placing time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements on vessel owners as a prerequisite to doing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP can also be applied to control of hazards from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical contaminants, even though the full range of possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical hazards is still imperfectly understood. Government and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
academia have important roles to play in researching the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicities of these chemicals, in monitoring them, and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing various forms of risk assessment. In some cases, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these efforts may result in the establishment of national maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits. In other cases, regional advisories may be more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. The seafood industry has a responsibility to know 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether chemical hazards are associated with the species they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling, whether the occurrence of such hazards depends on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvest site or other factors, and whether a sampling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis program on their part would be appropriate. Processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and importers should monitor the origin of raw materials and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported shipments to ensure, for example, that harvest did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur in locations subject to public health advisories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These are but a few examples of environmentally related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards to which HACCP can be applied. HACCP controls can also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that hazards are not being created inside a processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility through improper handling, cooking, or storing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Regulatory Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From a regulatory standpoint, inspections of processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities and of importers' plans and records would become more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficient and would be likely to have a much greater impact if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP controls were in place. A key feature of an inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system tied to implementation of HACCP is access by Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigators to the HACCP plan and to monitoring records kept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under that plan. In contrast to the ``snapshot'' provided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current inspections, examination of HACCP records will enable an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigator to see how the processing facility or the importer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operates over time. It will enable an investigator to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether problems have occurred, and how they were addressed. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will also enable an investigator to spot trends that could lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to problems, and thus to help prevent them from occurring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, it will enable the regulator to review the adequacy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the processor's or importer's preventive control system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself. Under such an inspection system, inadequate preventive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls would warrant remedial or regulatory action regardless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of whether the processor's or importer's product is actually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated or unsafe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP is not a zero risk system, however. Problems in food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production and processing will still occur. HACCP systems are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to detect and document those problems, so that they can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be corrected as quickly as possible. Thus, regulatory action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be warranted on the basis of the mere occurrence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing problems. It would be warranted, though, if the HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system is not functioning properly to detect and correct the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems, or if adulterated food is allowed to enter into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An inspection program tied to mandatory industry adoption of the HACCP system would not be industry self-certification,
nor would it be deregulatory. An investigator under such a program would perform HACCP reviews but not to the exclusion
of other inspection activities. Thus, it is highly doubtful whether any falsification of records would go undetected.
Investigators are taught to recognize falsification of records, and the inspection techniques they use would likely
reveal any instances in which the records do not reflect actual conditions and practices. Falsification of records
carries strict penalties under Federal law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike the other inspection options discussed previously that would involve continuous or high-frequency inspection
and commensurate costs, an inspection system tied to HACCP would not necessarily require an increase over current
inspection frequencies. Recordkeeping and record inspection will provide the inspector, however, with a broader
view. Moreover, to the extent that States adopt equivalent inspection programs in response to these proposed regulations,
the resultant network of consistent inspections would, in effect, increase the frequency of inspections at no additional
cost. The value to the nation of such a network would be substantial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that many States are under considerable pressure to cut back funding in areas where a Federal presence
also exists. For seafood, however, FDA urges that the States maintain their programs, strengthen them to the extent
possible, and work with the agency to integrate them into a HACCP-based, Federal/State network. Such an approach
would be consistent with recommendations relating to the role of States made by NAS in its 1991 report on seafood safety
(Ref. 7, p. 16). FDA especially invites comment on how the proposed FDA program should mesh with an existing State HACCP
program for seafood, such as the program that exists in Alaska, so that inconsistent Federal and State HACCP requirements
are not imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Decision To Propose To Make Use of HACCP Mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the foregoing reasons, FDA has tentatively concluded that a new system of regulatory controls for seafood is necessary,
and that HACCP is the appropriate system. Therefore, FDA is proposing to add part 123 to establish procedures for the
safe processing and importing of fish and fishery products. FDA is proposing these procedures under sections 402(a)(1),
402(a)(4), and 701(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(1), 342(a)(4), and 371(a)),
in conjunction with section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 264). Section 402(a)(1) of
the act states that food is adulterated if it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance that may render
it injurious to health. Section 402(a)(4) of the act was included in the act to provide additional control over insanitary
and contaminated foods. (H.R. Rept. No. 2139, 75th Cong., 3d sess. 6 (1938).) Section 701(a) of the act authorizes
the agency to adopt regulations for the efficient enforcement of the act. Section 361 of the PHS Act authorizes the
agency to adopt regulations to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations set out those requirements that the agency tentatively has concluded are the minimum necessary
to ensure that, to the extent possible, the processing and importation of fish and fishery products will not result
in a product that is injurious to health. These requirements include the establishment of HACCP preventive controls
that take into account the unique characteristics of seafood products. If a processor or an importer fails to adopt
and implement an HACCP plan that complies with the requirements that FDA is proposing, or otherwise fails to operate
in accordance with these proposed provisions, it will be preparing, packing, or holding the food under insanitary
conditions under which the food may be rendered injurious to health. Thus the food will be adulterated under section
402(a)(4) of the act and subject to regulatory action by FDA. The agency has reflected this fact in proposed &sect;123.6(d).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's tentative decision to adopt regulations that require the implementation of HACCP principles by the seafood
industry is grounded in the statutory objective of preventing food safety and sanitation problems. Section 402(a)(4)
of the act does not require that FDA demonstrate that food is actually hazardous or contaminated in order to deem the
food adulterated and to exclude it from commerce. Instead, under section 402(a)(4) of the act, food producers must
assure that the food is not ``prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby it 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may have been
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 contaminated with filth, or whereby it 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
may have been
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 rendered injurious to health.'' [emphasis added.] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In enforcing section 402(a)(4) of the act, FDA has considered, among other things, prevailing industry standards
and the technical state-of-the-art in determining on a case-by-case basis whether the conditions under which a company
is processing or handling food satisfy section 402(a)(4) of the act. This proposed regulation would codify an appropriate
state-of-the-art means of assuring seafood safety and of preventing sanitation problems under FDA's authority
to promulgate regulations for the ``efficient enforcement'' of the act (section 701(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 371(a))).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The factual record that FDA has developed concerning the safety and sanitation issues posed by seafood illustrates
the need for codifying appropriate preventive methods consistent with the emerging technical state-of-the-art
and explains why FDA's initial focus in implementing HACCP is on seafood. Proof that any particular process or set
of manufacturing conditions in the production of seafood has in fact caused injuries or sanitation problems is not,
however, a legal prerequisite to this rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed adoption of this rule is supported by several additional factors. First, as stated above, the application
of HACCP to the seafood industry has been the subject of a substantial amount of work, by the Federal government, some
States, academia, and the seafood industry itself, to develop specific HACCP models and otherwise to apply HACCP
to seafood processing and importation. The Model Seafood Surveillance Project (MSSP) was conducted by NOAA at the
request of Congress in 1986 to design an inspection system for seafood consistent with HACCP principles. This project
resulted in the development of 16 regulatory models for specific seafood products that describe the basis for a mandatory
seafood inspection system. Each model applies many of the NACMCF principles described above in the context of a specific
product, such as breaded shrimp, raw fish, and molluscan shellfish (Ref. 35, pp. 67 to 73). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MSSP was conducted with significant industry involvement. The importance of industry participation in the development
of HACCP systems was stressed by NAS in its 1985 study of HACCP (Ref. 36, pp. 13, 309, and 310). As part of the MSSP project,
49 workshops were conducted involving 1,200 industry, State, and university participants. HACCP controls were
considered for economic fraud and plant sanitation/hygiene as well as for safety because economic fraud and sanitation
have been problems in the seafood industry. The MSSP models cover nearly all the types of seafood products consumed
in the United States except for low acid canned seafood, which is already subject to a mandatory HACCP control and inspection
system under the low acid canned food regulations adopted by FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Low acid canned seafood products represent about 25 percent of all seafoods consumed in the United States (Ref. 7,
p. 23). The regulatory system in place for them represents the first formal application of HACCP principles to food
by a regulatory agency. As with this proposal, the regulations for low acid canned foods were requested by industry,
and they were developed through cooperation between Government and industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the low acid canned food regulations apply HACCP concepts to two hazards only, i.e., botulism in canned foods
and contamination because of poor container integrity, they are regarded as a major success and demonstrate the benefits
that HACCP can provide. Botulism in canned goods has been effectively controlled under the low acid canned food regulations
and is no longer a particular source of consumer concern. NAS recently concluded that canned fish is among the safest
of seafood items. (Ref. 7, p. 320). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seafood industry associations have been active in developing HACCP systems that their members could use. For the
past several years, the New England Fisheries Development Association (NEFDA) has been assisting firms in the northeast
to implement HACCP systems through Federal grants. NEFDA's activities include a pilot project for 15 processing
firms and participation in a retail seafood HACCP pilot (Ref. 18, p. 26). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Academia has been active as well. For example, the Oregon Sea Grant, which services the Oregon marine community as
part of the national Sea Grant extension service, has issued a publication, ``Hazard Analysis &amp; Critical Control
Point Applications to the Seafood Industry'' (Ref. 37). This publication explains the fundamentals of HACCP, inventories
microbial hazards of seafoods, and describes model HACCP systems for specific types of seafood processing operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of efforts like these by Government, industry, and academia, a considerable amount of literature and expertise
now exist to facilitate the development of HACCP systems by seafood processors and importers, significantly more
than for most other major segments of the food industry. Given the advanced state of knowledge about the application
of HACCP to the seafood industry, FDA is proposing to make the use of HACCP mandatory for the seafood industry to ensure
that there is compliance with section 402(a)(1) and 402(a)(4) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, seafood industry representatives have been urging the Federal Government to adopt a mandatory, HACCP-based
system for years. The National Fisheries Institute, the largest seafood industry trade association, and others
from the seafood industry testified repeatedly at congressional hearings from 1989 through 1992 in support of legislation
that would mandate such a system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indeed, nearly all of the seafood bills introduced in the Congress since the late 1980's, including the bills that
passed both chambers in 1990, contained HACCP elements. While there were different views on the merits of these legislative
proposals, virtually all Government agencies, both Federal and State, that testified on these proposals_as well
as most other witnesses_expressed support for the HACCP concept as it applies to seafood. The Chairman of the Interstate
Shellfish Sanitation Conference (ISSC), an organization of States, Federal agencies, and industry that considers
issues relating to molluscan shellfish safety, testified that a HACCP-type approach is now being used for aspects
of the shellfish program and endorsed HACCP for all seafood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant elements of the seafood industry continue to press for the Federal Government to institute a HACCP-based
program. An article in a 1992 edition of a seafood trade publication on the advantages of HACCP concluded: ``With the
seafood industry under a continuing barrage of negative press regarding the wholesomeness and safety of product,
the industry is impatient to get started with a seafood inspection program that will reassure consumers *&blank;*&blank;*''
(Ref. 19, p. 39). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In February, 1993, the Executive Vice President of the National Fisheries Institute wrote to the Secretary of Health
and Human Services asking that she ``initiate a state-of-the-art program for seafood which would be of significant
benefit to consumers * * *. HACCP-based regulation is very feasible for the seafood industry * * *. There is no reason
to wait for congressional action to put this modern technology in place'' (Ref. 38). As recently as April, 1993, the
President of the Pacific Seafood Processors wrote to FDA expressing support for a mandatory seafood HACCP program
(Ref. 39). The members of that organization process the majority of domestically harvested seafood. These requests
provide further evidence of the appropriateness of this proposal.

B. Preparing for HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA recognizes that this proposal involves a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
departure from current practices for most processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers and intends to work cooperatively with the industry in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the establishment of this proposed system. The agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiences under both its HACCP-based low acid canned food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations and the HACCP-based pilot programs for seafood that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it conducted with NOAA in 1991 demonstrate the need for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperation and technical support between the agency and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry in order to establish HACCP and to make it work. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FDA/NOAA joint pilot programs involved the development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and implementation of HACCP-based systems by seafood processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and HACCP-based inspections by the two agencies. Even though the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA/NOAA pilots involved highly motivated seafood firms that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volunteered to adopt HACCP, the firms found it difficult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initially to identify hazards and critical control points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with their own products and processes (Ref. 40). As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both the agencies and the firms discovered, HACCP involved new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ways of thinking and behaving that were not readily understood or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented. A considerable amount of consultation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance between the firms and the Government proved to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extremely helpful. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This experience reinforces the view that regulations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impose a HACCP-based system are needed for the seafood industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and thus represents a third factor supporting the appropriateness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this proposal. The systematic kind of preventive thinking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HACCP requires is not universal, but it can be adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations will ensure that processors and importers do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significantly, once participants in the pilot programs made the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transition to HACCP, they were able to identify benefits from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using HACCP to themselves and to consumers in terms of product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety and quality, as well as plant sanitation and organization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 40). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. International Trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although not a public health issue, international trade is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also a major consideration in determining the advisability and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits of a new system of seafood regulation and therefore will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be addressed here. It is estimated that close to 40 percent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish and shellfish harvested from the world's oceans, lakes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and other bodies of water entered international trade in 1991 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 41). This movement reflects the need to match supplies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with demand. Nations often have species in their waters for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which there is little or no demand among their consumers, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers in other countries may prefer these species. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, sometimes foreign markets are willing to pay higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prices than domestic markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participation in the international trade in seafood is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical to U.S. consumers and industry. Approximately 55 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of the U.S. supply of edible seafood is imported. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991, 3,014,819,000 pounds were imported, worth $5,617,887,000, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making the United States the world's second largest seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importing nation (Ref. 42).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the same time, the United States is the world's largest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exporter of fishery products. In 1991, the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exported more than $3 billion worth of seafood, making a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant positive contribution to this country's balance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments as well as to the many coastal State economies in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products are produced (Refs. 42 and 43). Our largest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market is Japan, followed by the European Community (EC) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada. Both Canada and the EC have implemented or are in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process of implementing mandatory HACCP-based seafood inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems (Refs. 32 and 44). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the significance of both international and domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade, ongoing efforts to harmonize or make equivalent country 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection systems and requirements takes on great significance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current multilateral round of trade negotiations under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further focus on this area. The draft text on sanitary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phytosanitary measures acknowledges the desire of the contracting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties, including the United States, to support ``the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harmonized sanitary and phytosanitary measures between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracting parties, on the basis of international standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines, and recommendations developed by the relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
international organizations including the Codex Alimentarious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission *&blank;*&blank;*'' (Ref. 45, p. L.35). This move toward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harmonization, coupled with the current recommendations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Codex Committee on Food Hygiene encouraging the international use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the HACCP system (Ref. 46), clearly argue for the adoption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this approach in the United States for seafood. Failure by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States to adopt a mandatory, HACCP-based inspection system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may ultimately undermine its export success, with considerable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic consequences. For example, in addition to the EC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada, Iceland, Australia, and many other fishing nations have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moved to a mandatory HACCP approach that could affect United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States competitiveness in the major seafood markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EC is the United States' second largest export market, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchasing $441 million worth of U.S. products in 1991. On July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22, 1991, EC Council Directive 91/493 was issued to set out the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions for the production and placing on the EC market fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fishery products (Ref. 44). This Directive requires, as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 1, 1993, that both member States and third countries:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* take all necessary measures so that, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all stages of the production of fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products *&blank;*&blank;* persons responsible must carry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out their own checks based on the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
_Identification of critical control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points in their establishments on the basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the manufacturing processes used; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_establishment and implementation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for monitoring and checking such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points; *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_keeping a written record *&blank;*&blank;* with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a view to submitting them to the competent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority *&blank;*&blank;*.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the directive provides some flexibility in terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalence, it is clear that the EC is looking for a mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP system along the lines proposed in this regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maintaining and expanding this export market is likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitated if this proposal is adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, ongoing discussions with Canada under the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of section 708 of the U.S./Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harmonize or make equivalent the two nations' respective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection systems and standards have made it clear that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed HACCP regulation will significantly facilitate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process (Ref. 47). Canada has recently completed implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a mandatory, HACCP-based seafood inspection program. Because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canada is the United States' third largest export market and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largest supplier of imported seafood, adoption of an equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system would not only achieve the objectives of the FTA but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially would save resources currently devoted to monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipments between our two countries. Similar potential benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be expected under the proposed North American FTA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly at this formative stage in that process. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitation of international trade is a fourth factor supporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriateness, and thus providing a rational basis, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's proposed course of action.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. The Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed regulations consist of a subpart of general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability (subpart A) and one subpart that sets forth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific additional provisions for raw molluscan shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(subpart C). The agency is also setting forth guidelines, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form of appendices, that will provide assistance to processors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked, ready-to-eat products (Appendix A), and to processors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombrotoxin forming species (Appendix B), on how to meet various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in subpart A relating to the development and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of HACCP plans. The products addressed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines involve special considerations or special hazards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which additional guidance would be useful. Processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers that follow these guidelines will increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likelihood that FDA will find their preventive controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable. FDA requests comments on the need for, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance of, the guidelines that it has set forth. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should address whether it would be more appropriate for FDA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopt the guidelines as regulations. If the comments provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convincing basis for doing so, FDA will include some or all of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the guidelines in the regulations in any final rule that results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is also including a guideline on how to ensure product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity relating to economic adulteration (Appendix D). FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including this guideline because economic adulteration is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular problem in the seafood industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Appendix 1 to this document, FDA is also providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples from a package of general guidance, to be published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separately, for processors to use in understanding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing HACCP principles in their operations. One of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples is specific guidance on the processing of smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish. FDA requests comments on whether the latter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance should remain as such, be provided as guidelines in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix to the regulations, or be made mandatory by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporating them into any final rule that results from this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is relying generally on the definitions contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the act, in the umbrella good manufacturing practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines in part 110, and in other agency regulations. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is using these definitions because it considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency in how it uses terms in its regulations to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary and appropriate. Thus, &sect;123.3(o) is derived from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;113.3(s), and &sect;123.3(r) is derived from &sect;110.3(q). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional definitions are proposed in &sect;123.3 that are specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the proposed HACCP program for fish and fishery products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing to define ``certification number'' in &sect;123.3(a) as a unique combination of letters
and numbers assigned to a shellfish processor by a shellfish control authority, usually the State. These numbers
are used to identify the processor on tags and labels and in recordkeeping required under proposed &sect;123.28.
States issue certification numbers to processors who receive shellfish from safe sources, keep requisite records
of shellfish purchases and sales, and operate in accordance with CGMP and the other certification requirements of
the State. This system of State issued numbers is used to identify the approximately 2,000 State certified shellfish
dealers that are included on the Interstate Certified Shellfish Shippers List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;123.3(b) to define ``cooked, ready-to-eat fishery product'' as a fishery product
that is subjected by a commercial processor to either a cooking process before being placed in a final container, or
to pasteurization in the final container, or to both. Cooked, ready-to-eat products undergo a heat treatment by a
processor that results in the coagulation of the protein. Because their organoleptic qualities suggest that they
are fully cooked, and thus ready-to-eat, these products will likely be eaten without any further heat treatment by
the consumer sufficient to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms and preformed toxins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As defined, cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products include products that must be stored either frozen or refrigerated.
Products such as canned seafoods that are subjected to a cooking process after being placed in a final container, while
technically considered cooked, ready-to-eat products, are not included in the definition because they are virtually
sterile in the final container. As used in these proposed regulations, the term applies to cooked, ready-to-eat products
that do not receive a heat treatment in the final container by the processor sufficient to destroy all pathogens and
create a shelf-stable product that does not need refrigeration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;123.3(c) to define ``critical control point'' for purposes of these regulations
as a point in a food process where there is a high probability that improper control may cause, allow, or contribute
to a hazard in the final food. This is a modification of the definition of the same term in &sect;110.3(e). Under that
definition, a ``critical control point'' is a point where an improper control could cause, allow, or contribute to
``filth in the final food or decomposition in the final food'' as well as to a ``hazard'' in the final food. Clearly,
that definition is intended to apply both to human food safety and to certain quality issues that would not normally
cause illness. In this document, FDA is proposing to require the identification of critical control points for safety
only and is encouraging, but not requiring, the identification of certain critical control points for hazards not
normally related to safety. The modification of the part 110 definition being proposed here represents the least
revision necessary to achieve that purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to define ``critical limit'' in &sect;123.3(d) as a maximum or minimum value to which a physical,
biological, or chemical parameter must be controlled at a critical control point to minimize the risk of occurrence
of the identified hazard. This definition is consistent with that of NACMCF, which defined ``critical limit'' as
``a criterion that must be met for each preventive measure associated with a critical control point'' (Ref. 34, p.
186), but FDA's proposed definition is somewhat more explanatory. Critical limits can be either maximum values,
such as the maximum amount of histamine that can be allowed in a fish, or minimum values, such as the minimum temperature
needed during a cooking step to kill pathogens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed definition states that control is for the purpose of minimizing risk. While complete prevention of a
hazard is obviously the most desirable of all possible outcomes, the proposed definition recognizes that, in reality,
complete prevention cannot always be ensured. A processor can minimize a microbiological hazard with a cooked, ready-to-eat
product by proper cooking, but the hazard could still occur if the product is contaminated or otherwise abused elsewhere
in the distribution system or in the home. This aspect of the definition is consistent with the view of NACMCF, which
states that: ``Each CCP [critical control point] will have one or more preventive measures that must be properly controlled
to assure prevention, elimination or reduction of hazards to acceptable levels'' (Ref. 34, p. 196). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;123.3(e) to define ``fish'' and broadly to encompass the range of seafood products
that are processed or marketed commercially in the United States. Thus, the term ``fish'' includes all fresh or saltwater
finfish, molluscan shellfish, crustaceans, and other forms of aquatic animal life. Birds are specifically excluded
from the definition because commercial species of birds are either nonaquatic or, as in the case of aquatic birds such
as ducks, regulated by USDA. Mammals are also specifically excluded because no aquatic mammals are processed or marketed
commercially in this country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Fishery products'' in proposed &sect;123.3(f) are any edible human food product derived in whole or in part from
fish, including fish that has been processed in any manner. This definition reflects the tentative conclusion of
the agency to propose mandatory HACCP requirements at this time to control hazards associated with processing and
importing seafood products intended for human consumption. The proposed definition includes products that contain
ingredients other than seafood in keeping with the scope of FDA's regulatory authority. The control of hazards is
as important for products that contain ingredients other than fish as it is for products consisting of fish alone.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;123.3(g) to define ``harvester'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a person who commercially takes molluscan shellfish from their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growing waters, by any means. Harvester is defined because, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under this proposal, this person has responsibility for tagging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product as to where it was harvested and when. Harvesters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are expected to have an identification number issued by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish control authority. Harvesting is generally illegal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without such a number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to define the term ``importer'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.3(h) as the owner of the imported goods or his 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative in the United States. This is the person who is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for ensuring goods being entered are in compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with all laws affecting the importation. Importers may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always directly handle the imported food, but they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for the safety and wholesomeness of products they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offer for entry into the United States and therefore are subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to part 123. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes that the term ``importer'' is often used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to describe not only the owner of the goods or his representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the United States (that is, the importer of record) but also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes freight forwarders, food brokers, food jobbers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carriers, and steamship representatives. These other agents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
often represent the importer for legal and financial purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are not necessarily related to the safety of the product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agency has tentatively concluded that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriate to focus the HACCP requirements that bear on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imports on these persons if they do not have authority to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions affecting the product's safety or wholesomeness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to define a ``lot of molluscan shellfish'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.3(i) as no more than one day's harvest from a single, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined growing area, by one or more harvesters. This definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes the quantity of shellfish that represents a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lot for tagging or labeling purposes. Lot distinctions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed to differentiate shellfish harvested from different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growing areas or at different times. The time limit of one day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is imposed because the safety of a harvesting area can change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily as the result of rainfall, tides, winds, and other events 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can bring contaminants into the area. The ultimate safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of raw molluscan shellfish is contingent on the water quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harvesting area. To ensure product safety, shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvesting areas that are subject to appropriate state control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are closed to harvesting within 24 hours of a finding of adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. The lot definition, coupled with the harvest date on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harvesting tag, provides evidence that the shellfish were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvested when the area was safe and open for harvesting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;123.3(j) that ``molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish'' means any edible species, or edible portion of fresh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or frozen oysters, clams, mussels, and scallops, except were the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scallop product consists entirely of the shucked adductor mussel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distinction between molluscan shellfish and crustacean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish, which include crabs, shrimp, and lobsters, is made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because molluscan shellfish are commonly eaten whole and raw, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while crustacean shellfish are not. The safety of molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish therefore reflects the quality of the waters from which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are harvested and requires special public health controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the agency is proposing to amend the definition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``shellfish'' in &sect;1240.3(p) (21 CFR 1240.3(p)) to make it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the proposed definition in &sect;123.3(j). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to amend the term ``shellfish'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1240.3(p) to read ``molluscan shellfish'' to make the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent between parts 123 and 1240. Because the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish in its common usage, i.e., an edible mollusk or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crustacean, includes crabs and lobsters, the agency believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is necessary to be more specific and accurate in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition and consequent application of the requirements in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The proposed requirements for tagging do not apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to crabs and lobsters or to scallops when the final product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shucked adductor muscle only. The agency is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expand the definition in &sect;1240.3(p) to include scallops to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it consistent with the definitions in proposed part 123 and with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements under NSSP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to define ``potable water'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.3(k) as water that meets EPA's primary drinking water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations as set forth in 40 CFR part 141. Those regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide limits for certain microbiological, chemical, physical, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and radiological contaminants that can render water unsafe for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed definition is slightly different from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``potable water'' in &sect;&sect;1240.3(k) and 1250.3(j) (21 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 1250.3(j). That definition also references the regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of EPA in 40 CFR part 141 but further includes FDA sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in 21 CFR parts 1240 and 1250. Those sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements apply to interstate travel conveyances that must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take on water at watering points. Such requirements are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant to these proposed regulations and thus were not included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the proposed definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to define ``processing'' and ``processor'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.3(m) and (n) broadly to ensure the safety of seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the application of HACCP principles throughout the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood industry. The definition of ``processor'' is intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include all seafood processors that handle products in interstate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce, such as shuckers and other processors of raw molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish, factory ships, packers, repackers, wholesalers, and warehouses. Those who process low acid canned foods
are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included, even though they are subject to the HACCP controls of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 113. Those controls are targeted toward a limited number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety hazards. These proposed regulations require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors apply HACCP controls to all likely safety hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the regulations at part 113, the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of ``processor'' also includes persons engaged in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of foods that are to be used in market or consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests. FDA has tentatively concluded that HACCP controls are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed for such products because the hazards associated with them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are no different from those that can affect other commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are, however, certain handlers of seafood that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the coverage of the proposed definition. Fishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels that essentially only harvest are not covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed HACCP regulations. As explained earlier, FDA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traditionally refrained from directly regulating fishing vessels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency anticipates that the regulations being proposed here 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would affect vessels indirectly through processor and importer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls over raw materials and imported shipments, e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventive controls such as the purchasing of raw materials only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from fishing vessels that engage in proper sanitation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature practices and that harvest only from approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transportation companies that carry, but do not otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, fish and fishery products are also outside the scope of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed definition, although the agency expects that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transporters will be affected indirectly in the same manner as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishing vessels (see also &sect;110.93). FDA invites comment on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspect of the coverage of the proposed regulations. Proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration during transport is important for the safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombroid species products and of cooked, ready-to-eat products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Time and temperature conditions during shipment can also affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposition related to other factors bearing on seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality. These proposed regulations will affect transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
companies indirectly through the preventive controls the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer will need to impose to ensure that the raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials or imported shipments that it receives are free of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant hazards and have been appropriately handled. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites public discussion on whether this approach is adequate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, if not, whether HACCP requirements should be applied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly to transportation companies. This issue is complex, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially because it is not unusual for transporters to deliver 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a variety of food products, including seafood, to several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consignees during a single shipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has also tentatively decided to exclude retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishments from the definition of ``processor.'' As with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishing vessels, FDA has traditionally exercised enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion with regard to retail establishments. The number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail establishments in this country_literally in the hundreds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of thousands_would totally overwhelm any rational Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection system. FDA has traditionally provided training and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other forms of technical assistance to States and local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments to inspect retail food establishments through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's retail Federal/State cooperative program. A major part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of that cooperative program involves the development of model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
codes, some of which have been widely adopted by State and local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments. FDA is now consolidating those model codes into a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single, updated food code for the retail sector. Appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP-based controls are included to address seafood hazards at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail. Consequently, FDA will continue to operate through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal/State cooperative mechanism and has not included a retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
component in proposed part 123. FDA requests comments on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentative approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States are strongly encouraged, however, to consider how the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles in these regulations could be applied to seafood at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail and to shift to HACCP-type inspection systems as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. Because of the high perishability of fresh seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the sometimes lengthy and complex distribution chain, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products can have relatively short shelf lives by the time they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reach fresh fish counters and restaurants. In addition, seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be subject at retail both to cross-contamination because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poor handling practices and to species substitution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Improper handling of seafood and other problems at retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been documented in recent years. NAS has concluded that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant number of reported acute health problems were likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
linked to handling and preparation practices in food service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishments (Ref. 7, p. 27). The February, 1992 edition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumer Reports magazine reported on a number of such problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with regard to seafood that were observed in retail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishments. A number of studies have found lack of adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature controls in retail facilities (Ref. 48, p. 75). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to define ``shellfish control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority'' in &sect;123.3(p) as the government entity responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing a comprehensive shellfish sanitation program. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish control authority, among other things, is responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for classifying shellfish growing waters, performing inspections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of shellfish processors, and issuing certification numbers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish processors. FDA relies on recognized governmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health and food control agencies, both domestic and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreign, to carry out these functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to define ``shellstock'' in &sect;123.3(q) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as meaning raw, in-shell molluscan shellfish. This specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product form designation is needed because the applicability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tagging, labeling, and recordkeeping requirements proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.28(b) and (c) is determined by whether the product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellstock or shucked product, respectively.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing to define ``shucked shellfish'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.3(s) as meaning molluscan shellfish that have one or both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shells removed. The labeling and recordkeeping requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in &sect;123.28(c) apply to shucked shellfish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing to define ``tag'' in &sect;123.3(t) as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record of harvesting information attached to a container of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellstock by the harvester or processor. Under proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1240.60(b), the tag or bill-of-lading will identify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor, harvester, date of harvest, and State, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific location of harvest. Most shellfish-producing States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and countries currently require that shellfish harvested in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters bear documentation with such information. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information is the minimum necessary to permit ready 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of site and time of harvest of the shellfish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because raw molluscan shellfish directly reflect the quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harvesting area, this information is necessary to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance that the shellfish were harvested from an area that was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe and open for harvesting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Purpose and Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 123.5(a) of the proposed regulations references the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
umbrella CGMP guidelines in part 110 as providing general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance with regard to such matters as facility design, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials, personnel practices, and cleaning and sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. Because part 110 provides guidance of general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability to all foods, the agency intends that this guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will continue to be valid for seafood processors when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations at part 123 are issued in final form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;123.5(b) makes clear that the purpose of subpart A of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 123 is to set forth requirements specific to the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and importation of fish and fishery products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. HACCP Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.6 that commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and importers of fish and fishery products develop and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement HACCP plans in keeping with Principle 6 of the NACMCF 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed previously. Development and implementation of an HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan requires that processors think through the entire process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow from raw materials to finished product shipping to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that safety hazards are controlled by design, and that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate that process as a matter of daily routine. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers, the thought process will begin with a decision from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whom and from where to buy fishery products and follow through to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangements for shipment to the United States, storage in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States, and end when the product leaves the control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer. The plan provides the structure for the preventive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls, including the recordkeeping associated with those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls, that a processor or importer is to employ. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, FDA has tentatively concluded that the essential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements of this structure must include: (1) The identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of hazards to ensure that the processor or importer knows what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hazards are, so that it controls them by design rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by chance (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)); (2) the identification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points to ensure that the processor or importer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knows where to monitor to prevent or minimize the occurrence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the relevant hazard (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(2)); (3) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of critical limits that must be met at each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control point, so that the processor or importer has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective standards in place by which to determine whether it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling the relevant hazard (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(3)); (4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the identification of procedures for how and when the processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or importer will monitor the critical control points to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both that monitoring is done as a matter of routine, and that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is done in an appropriate manner and with sufficient frequency to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish preventive control (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(4)); and (5) a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping system for that monitoring that will establish for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor's or importer's benefit that it is effectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing a system of preventive controls, and record how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those controls are operating over time (proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.6(b)(5)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recordkeeping system is the key to HACCP. As explained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, the records will enable the processor or importer, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ultimately the regulator, to see the operations of the processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or importer through time, rather than only how they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functioning at a particular moment in time. Among other things, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP records can reveal trends that might otherwise go 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undetected until significant problems occurred.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All of these requirements reflect the HACCP principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed by NACMCF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not proposing to require that the HACCP plan be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signed by any official of a company, but invites comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merits of such a requirement in the final regulations as a means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of both ensuring and demonstrating formal adoption of the plan by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that company. FDA also invites comment on who in the firm would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be the appropriate individual to sign the plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Guidelines and Other Assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA recognizes that HACCP plans will vary in complexity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from those having many critical control points, such as plans for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multicomponent, ready-to-eat products, to those having only a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points, such as a plan for a fish filleting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant. Plan development can be facilitated by technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance from many sources and by the detailed advice provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the literature. NACMCF, for example, has recommended that, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate the development of HACCP plans, processors should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create an HACCP team, identify the intended use and likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers of the food, and prepare a flow diagram of the entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing process to help identify critical control points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency favors simplicity and the rapid development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plans without undue expense. The appendices at the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed regulations are intended to facilitate plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development by setting forth certain critical control points, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limits, controls, and records that, if incorporated into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or prepared under a HACCP plan, would be acceptable to the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the types of products mentioned. To further facilitate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of HACCP plans, FDA intends to issue separate HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance for seafood that will provide information on hazards and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate controls by species and by product type. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidance will provide a broad spectrum of information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from which firms will be able to identify likely hazards and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points that apply to them. The agency believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the number of critical control points will range, roughly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between 2 and 12 per product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidance will also contain a fill-in-the-blank type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plan with instructions on how to complete the plan based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information in the guidance. The agency has tentatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that a plan that follows this model is likely to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable to FDA. The agency is including samples of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance it is developing in Appendix 1 to this document. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intends to issue a separate draft guidance document for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment and to make the completed guidance available to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public at the time that the regulations are finalized.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, seafood trade associations, university Sea 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant extension offices, and others have already developed work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sheets and other aids to facilitate HACCP planning for seafood. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Industry members are encouraged to contact their trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations and state universities or Sea Grant extension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices on such matters.

3. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Even with these forms of assistance, however, FDA recognizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HACCP plans cannot be written and implemented overnight. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has already been discussed, the HACCP system of controls can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve new ways of thinking and performing on a routine basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, FDA is proposing that these regulations will become 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective 1 year after issuance of the final rule in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proceeding. The agency has tentatively concluded that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of time is sufficient to permit the development and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of HACCP plans by the industry. FDA specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comment on whether 1 year will be adequate. The agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective is to provide enough time to permit processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers to understand HACCP, analyze the relevant hazards, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop an appropriate HACCP plan, but also to avoid unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the proposed effective date, inspection of HACCP plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will occur as part of routine, mandatory plant inspections and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
import examinations. FDA is not proposing to require that HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans be submitted to FDA in advance, or that preapproval by FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a condition of their adoption or implementation. FDA is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring preapproval for two reasons. First, HACCP plans can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only properly be judged in the context of the facility itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, while FDA investigators will consider the adequacy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan during their inspections, preapproval does not seem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranted. Second, the agency simply does not have the resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to make preapproval a requirement. Given the protections that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are built into the HACCP approach, FDA tentatively finds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preapproval is not necessary to ensure that fish and fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products are not produced under conditions whereby they may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act.

4. Location and Product Type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;123.6(a) to require that every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor and importer have and implement an HACCP plan that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific both to each location where that processor engages in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing and to each kind of fish and fishery product being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed. A plan should be specific to each location because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the likely hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring procedures can vary from one facility to the next 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depending on such factors as type of equipment, conditions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, and location. A plan also should be specific to each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of fish and fishery product for the same kinds of reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hazards can vary depending on species, location of catch, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not intend, however, to require a processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer to write a separate plan, or separate part of a plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each fish and fishery product it handles if the likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures are identical for each of them. For example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventive controls necessary to ensure safety for most deep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water species of finfish from the north Atlantic may be virtually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identical. The agency has tentatively concluded that, in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases, a processor or importer may group the fish or fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products together in an HACCP plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Safety Hazards Only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.6(b)(1) that HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans identify the human food safety hazards that must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled for each fish and fishery product being processed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer. There exists a range of opinion on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether HACCP should apply solely to safety hazards, as this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision proposes to require, or whether HACCP should apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other types of hazards, such as decomposition not normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with illness in humans. One school of thought holds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that HACCP should apply to safety hazards only in order to keep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it focused and to not overwhelm operators with an unnecessarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large number of critical control points that have no bearing on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the primary concern of safety. Another view holds that, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood at least, HACCP-type controls can be applied to various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer risks without generating an excessive number of critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control points. The Codex Committee on Food Hygiene came to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
latter conclusion (Ref. 46), as did NOAA as a result of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiences during the MSSP (Ref. 35, p. 70). Partly for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason, the FDA/NOAA HACCP pilot programs involved HACCP controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for safety and HACCP-type controls for other hazards as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of these proposed regulations, however, FDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of HACCP is intended for the efficient enforcement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 402(a)(1) and 402(a)(4) of the act, which applies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products that contain substances that may render the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injurious to health and to processing conditions that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insanitary and that could render a product injurious to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, FDA is proposing to require that HACCP plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include identification of hazards that could affect human food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety only. To facilitate the production of such plans, FDA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1) the types of hazards that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been associated with seafood (see section II.C. of this document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a discussion of these hazards). All of these hazards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified and discussed in the NAS report on seafood safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 7).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Processors and importers should identify in their written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans only those safety hazards that are reasonably likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur, rather than every conceivable hazard no matter how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
theoretical or remote. This view is in keeping with NACMCF's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation that firms conduct a hazard analysis and then give 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no further consideration to hazards that are unlikely to occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 34, p. 189). FDA has tentatively concluded that processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and importers should not be required to establish controls and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regularly monitor for hazards that are highly unlikely to occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the absence of those controls. If, for example, chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants have never been found, or have only been found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts significantly below levels of public health concern in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species from a particular location, processors and importers need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not identify chemical contaminants as a hazard that must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled for that fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated earlier in this preamble, FDA intends to issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a guidance document that will cover possible environmental and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing hazards for fish and fishery products as well as types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of controls that can be applied to those hazards. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipates that it will update that guidance periodically as new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls (or new hazards) are identified or established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA cannot reasonably expect processors and importers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercise controls for hazards that are beyond the scope of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current scientific knowledge. The agency does expect processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and importers to demonstrate that they are taking precautions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are reasonable in light of available information, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are adopting new controls as those controls are developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and accepted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the controls for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrio 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
bacteria in raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molluscan shellfish, which can cause serious illness and death in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain at-risk populations, are the subject of continuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research at FDA and elsewhere. Short of a complete ban on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvesting, there is no known control that would prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrios 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in molluscan shellfish. Moreover, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infectious dose, that is, the number of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrios 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause illness, is unknown. Because these bacteria occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
naturally in the environment and are ubiquitous, controls that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are employed to prevent sewage-related viruses from entering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molluscan shellfish are not relevant to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrios. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is known, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, that proper temperature controls from the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvest onward can at least limit the growth of these bacteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 49). FDA believes that such controls are reasonable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be applied now. (In fact, temperature controls have long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been a feature of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NSSP).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the hazards listed in proposed &sect;123.6(b), pesticides and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drug residues (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(iv) and (b)(1)(v)) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forms of chemical contaminants (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(iii)) but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are listed separately because they can be of special concern in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aquaculture-raised species. These fish generally have a greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likelihood of being exposed to agricultural run-off than wild 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ocean stocks (Ref. 50, pp. 11 and 12). Aquaculture-raised fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are known to be fed drugs for various purposes. Drug residues in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edible tissues can be a public health concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decomposition, listed in proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(vi), is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known hazard in those species that can generate scombrotoxin when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they decompose; otherwise, it is regarded as a quality problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parasites (proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(vii)) are not a hazard if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
killed during cooking but can be a hazard in finfish consumed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw, unless that fish is commercially frozen. Unapproved direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and indirect food and color additives (proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.6(b)(1)(viii)) are a potential hazard with most any food.

6. Critical Control Points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the HACCP principles identified by NACMCF, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.6(b)(2) that critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control points be identified for each of the hazards that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer has identified. Hazards may be caused by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improper processing or by events outside the processor's or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer's direct control. To control the latter type of hazard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is, environmental hazards and hazards that may be caused by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poor handling prior to receipt of fish or fishery products by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer, the point of receipt by the processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer represents a critical control point. As indicated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously in this preamble, the processor or importer may need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that it obtains imported shipments or raw materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only from harvesters, transporters, and others who can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that they also have exercised appropriate controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hazards that may be caused by both improper processing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events outside the plant are controlled by the critical limits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring, control procedures, and recordkeeping that are done 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of HACCP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Critical Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In &sect;123.6(b)(3), consistent with NACMCF principles, FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing that processors and importers identify critical limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the plan that must be met at each critical control point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical limits must be met to ensure that the relevant hazard is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoided. Thus, some critical limits can be set to reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory levels established by FDA in the form of action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels, regulatory limits, and tolerances for such contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as pesticides, histamine, and other contaminants. FDA intends to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compile all such levels in the guidance document described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other critical limits can be set in consultation with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside experts, in keeping with the longstanding practice for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low acid canned foods. For example, as explained later in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble with respect to cooked, ready-to-eat products, there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist a range of possible cooking time-temperature combinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will deactivate pathogens during the cooking step, depending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the type of equipment being used by the processor and the size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and species of fish being cooked. The existence of a range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective cooking time-temperature combinations convinced FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to establish specific cooking time-temperatures for industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the regulations for low acid canned foods. Rather, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided to rely on outside experts and on research within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific community to establish cooking times and temperatures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these products. FDA is not proposing specific cooking time-temperature requirements for most seafood products
(although FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is providing guidance on time, temperature, and salinity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters for smoked and smoke-flavored fish, as is fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained in Appendix 1 to this document) for the same reason. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Monitoring and Control Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;123.6(b)(4) requires that the processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer identify in the HACCP plan the procedures that it will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use to control and monitor each critical control point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring steps are necessary to ensure that the critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control point is in fact under control and to produce an accurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record of what has occurred at the critical control point (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34, p. 197). Among the procedures that are to be used under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.6(b)(4) is monitoring of the consumer complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received by the processor. While the goal of an HACCP system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent all likely hazards from occurring, no system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foolproof. Consumer complaints may be the first alert that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor has that deviations are occurring that are not being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevented or uncovered by the processor's HACCP controls. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has tentatively concluded, therefore, that each HACCP system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should take advantage of consumer complaints as they relate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operation of critical control points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;123.6(b)(4) also requires that procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling and monitoring critical control points must include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calibration of process control instruments and validation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
software for computer control systems, as appropriate. For a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor's preventive controls to work, the instruments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment that it relies upon in monitoring critical control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points, such as thermometers, temperature-recording devices, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computer software, must be accurate and reliable. FDA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively concluded that the best way to ensure such accuracy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reliability is to require that the processor's monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures include steps necessary to verify the reliability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these instruments and devices.

9. Recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained above, a HACCP system will not work unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records are generated during the operation of the HACCP plan, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these records are maintained and are available for review (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section IV.A.6. of this document). Thus, FDA is requiring in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.6(b)(5) that the HACCP plan provide for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping system that will document the processor's or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer's monitoring of the critical control points. Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.6(b)(5) also requires that HACCP records contain the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values obtained during monitoring, such as the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures and times. FDA has tentatively concluded that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not possible for the processor to derive the full benefits of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP system, nor is it possible for FDA to verify the operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the system, without actual values. Notations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration temperatures are satisfactory or unsatisfactory, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without recording the actual temperatures, are vague and subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to varying interpretation and thus will not ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventive controls are working. Also, it is not possible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discern trends without actual values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, proposed &sect;123.6(b)(5) requires that HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records include the actual consumer complaints that may have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received by the processor or importer relating to the operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of critical control points or possible critical limit deviations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has tentatively concluded that it may be necessary on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occasion for it to review these complaints in order to be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
validate whether the firm is taking necessary steps to review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls and correct deviations as necessary in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not FDA's intent to gain unlimited access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry's consumer complaint files through this proposal or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engage in ``fishing expeditions'' through consumer complaint files. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only those consumer complaints relating to the operation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP critical control points need be included as HACCP records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA's interest is solely in verifying that the HACCP system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
working as it should. The agency understands the sensitivities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with consumer complaint records and invites comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on this aspect of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

10. Nonsafety Hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;123.6(c) encourages, but does not require, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and importers to include in their plans controls for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards other than hazards to health. Examples listed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.6(c)(1)(i) and (ii) are decomposition not associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human illness and economic adulteration. FDA is not requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and importers to include nonsafety hazards in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plans for reasons stated previously. However, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is encouraging processors and importers to apply HACCP principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to these nonsafety hazards, and to control them in the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner that processors and importers control safety hazards (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.6(c)(2)), because they are common problems in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood industry. FDA has included a guideline on economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulteration with these proposed regulations (see Appendix D). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite the fact that these proposed regulations do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require HACCP controls for nonsafety hazards, such hazards as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic adulteration, decomposition not normally associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human illness, general unfitness for food, and misbranding, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute violations of the act and are subject to regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action by FDA (see sections 402(a)(3) and 403 of the act (21 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 343). Inspections by FDA investigators will continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consider and enforce these provisions of the act.

D. Corrective Actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;123.7 to require that deviations from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limits trigger a prescribed series of actions by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer, including determining the significance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the deviation, taking appropriate remedial action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documenting the actions taken. This proposed provision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the HACCP principles enunciated by NACMCF (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
34). First, under proposed &sect;123.7(a)(1), any critical limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation will require the segregation and holding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected product until the significance of the deviation can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined. This step is necessary to ensure that products that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be injurious to health do not enter commerce until the impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the deviation on safety has been determined, and the safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product assured. Second, under proposed &sect;123.7(a)(2), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer must actually determine the effect of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation on safety, and third, under proposed &sect;123.7(a)(3), it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must take whatever corrective actions are necessary with respect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to both the affected product and the critical control point at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the deviation occurred, based on that determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some deviations, especially if they are caught quickly, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not adversely affect safety. For example, if a refrigeration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit fails, but product being stored there is moved to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
functioning unit before any appreciable warming of the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can occur, safety will not have been affected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.7(a)(2) that the safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination be made by an individual who has successfully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completed training in HACCP principles (see proposed &sect;123.9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has tentatively concluded that this requirement is necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that the person who is reviewing the significance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the deviation understands the possible consequences of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing deviation and knows how to take appropriate measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in response to a deviation. FDA does not expect that a processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or importer will be able, without assistance, to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health consequences of every possible deviation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required training will, however, provide the processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer with information about when and how to obtain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance of an analytical laboratory, outside expert, State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory authority, or FDA district office in determining the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper course of action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.7(a)(4) and (a)(5) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor or importer review the process and the HACCP plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine whether the deviation reveals the need to modify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process or the plan, or both, and to make such modifications as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be needed. It is critically important that a processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer learn as much as possible from the occurrence of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation and take steps to ensure that it will not be repeated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The plan should be a living document that the processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer should modify and update as circumstances warrant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed requirements will ensure that the processor and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer connect day-to-day processing and other operations to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan. Each modification is required to be noted, dated, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained as part of their HACCP records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.7(b) that when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer receives a consumer complaint that may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to the performance of a critical control point or that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may reflect a critical limit deviation, it take appropriate steps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine whether a deviation or other system failure has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred that warrants remedial action and take such remedial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action that appears to be warranted under &sect;123.7(a). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance of consumer complaints has been discussed above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that segregation and holding of the affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product will not always be feasible or warranted in response to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer complaint. In many cases, there will be no product to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hold because all of the product in question will already be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce. In other cases, a processor or importer may be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine very quickly whether a deviation has actually occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;123.7(c) to require that processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and importers clearly document all of the steps that they take in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response to a critical limit deviation or a consumer complaint 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and include that documentation as part of their HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records. FDA has tentatively concluded that the processor, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer, and FDA will benefit from this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Documentation helps processors and importers to think the whole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process through in a thorough and methodical way and to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to their own satisfaction that they have taken proper steps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Documentation enables the regulatory agency to determine whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor or importer is able to regain control once a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation occurs and to ensure that potentially unsafe products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are being prevented from entering commerce or at least quickly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed from commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The documentation that FDA is proposing to require of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor's or importer's response to the consumer complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by &sect;123.7(b) will enable the processor, the importer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and FDA reviewers to determine whether those consumer complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are receiving appropriate attention in a timely manner. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation should be clear enough to allow a determination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nature of the complaint and of the time it took from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt of the complaint for processor or importer to review it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to take any necessary corrective actions. FDA may choose on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occasion to review a limited number of consumer complaints to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
match against the documentation maintained by the processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the importer.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There is a strong view in the HACCP literature (see e.g., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ref. 51), which is reflected in one of NACMCF's seven principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed above, that processors should actually have a plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describing how they will handle deviations, and that this plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be part of the overall HACCP plan. FDA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is merit in this view and encourages processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers to think through how they will handle deviations that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may occur. The agency has tentatively concluded, however, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed requirements in &sect;123.7 represent the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements necessary to ensure that processors and importers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond effectively to deviations that could affect safety, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that given these provisions, it is not necessary to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a specific plan be formulated and adopted. FDA requests comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on this tentative conclusion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, maintenance of appropriate records is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fundamental to the success of an HACCP system (see section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV.A.6. of this document). In recognition of this fact, FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to require in &sect;123.8 that HACCP records contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain necessary information; that processors review records of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and related activities before distributing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products to which the records pertain; that processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers retain records for specific periods of time; and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA investigators be given access to HACCP records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;123.8(a) that records involving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observations or measurements during processing, corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and related activities, contain the identity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, product code, and date that the record was made. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose of this provision is to ensure that both the processor or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer and the regulator can readily link a record to a product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and to the timeframe in which the product was manufactured. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
linkage of the record to product is especially important when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there has been a deviation at a critical control point. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency has tentatively concluded that including the identity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product, product code, and date of the activity that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record reflects provide the minimum necessary information to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable the processor or the importer and, ultimately, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulator to determine what product may have been affected and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take appropriate action, such as withholding the product from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution or recalling it from distribution. Dates also help 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discern trends over time. Even when no deviation has occurred, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the information will enable both the processor and the regulator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to identify factors that may help prevent problems in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.8(a), FDA is also proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information be recorded at the time that it is observed, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each record be signed by the operator or observer. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important that information relating to observations be recorded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately to ensure accuracy. The record should be signed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the individual who made the observation to ensure responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and accountability. Also, if there is a question about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record, a signature ensures that the source of the record will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.8(b) that records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive a second review by an individual trained in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with &sect;123.9, for verification purposes, before the product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributed into commerce. The purpose of this review is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the processor or importer verifies that employees are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recording data in HACCP records, and that deviations from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limits are being caught before products that may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been affected can enter commerce. The agency is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that this records verification be performed by a trained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual to ensure that the records are reviewed by a person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who understands the HACCP system, understands the significance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a processing deviation, and knows how to respond if a deviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;123.8(c) to require that HACCP records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be retained for at least 1 year after they are prepared for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated products and for at least 2 years after they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared for frozen or preserved (i.e., shelf-stable) products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These timeframes are based on the length of time that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products can be expected to be in commercial distribution (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
52; Ref. 53, pp. 72&hyph;73) plus a reasonable time thereafter to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the records are there when the FDA inspector performs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the next inspection. They are the same timeframes as now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided for in the Manual of Operations of the NSSP for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retention of records for raw molluscan shellfish.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, FDA is also proposing to require in &sect;123.8(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the processor retain any records relating to the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequacy of the equipment or processes being used by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor, including the results of scientific studies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluations to determine adequacy, for 1 year beyond the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability of these records to refrigerated products being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced by the processor, and for 2 years beyond the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability of the records to frozen or preserved products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being produced by the processor. The processor may need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain a written scientific evaluation of a process, such as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking, pasteurization, or cooling process, to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process it is using is adequate to destroy pathogens or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent their growth. Such an evaluation may also be necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure the adequacy of the cooking, pasteurizing, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerating equipment that the processor is using. (See the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble discussion on cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with processing records, these records should be retained for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a period of time that reflects the period that the products to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which they relate can be expected to be in commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that some processing plants may be closed on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a seasonal basis. Given the nature of the HACCP system, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA may choose to inspect at least the records of a plant even if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plant is not in operation. Therefore, FDA is providing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.8(c) that if a processing facility is closed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between seasonal packs, the records may be transferred to some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonably accessible location during the period of closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.8(d) that HACCP plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and records be available for review and copying by authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency employees at reasonable times. As already discussed, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's access to HACCP records is essential to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP system is working, and that the safety of seafood is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensured by design. FDA's authority to require maintenance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these records, and to provide for agency access to them, is fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported by the holding in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements on firms that process foods when such requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 387 U.S. 158, 163&hyph;164 (1967). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance of the records in ensuring that fish and fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products will not be rendered injurious to health has been fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed. FDA access to these records will expedite the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's efforts to ensure that the fish and fishery products in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interstate commerce are not adulterated and to identify any such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products that are. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is aware that there is substantial public interest in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the extent to which industry-generated HACCP records could or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be publicly available. As FDA understands it, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
argument in favor of availability is that where an inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system to protect the public health relies heavily on records, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those records should be public to the maximum extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The arguments in favor of protection of records, on the other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand, are based on concerns about advantages to competitors from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure and on the risk that the records will be otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misused if they become public. FDA invites comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general question of public disclosure of HACCP records and on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's preliminary analysis of their availability, as follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has longstanding explicit statutory access to certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry records during inspections involving infant formula, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drugs, and devices and has access by regulation to certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing records during inspections of low acid canned food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors. The agency has the right to copy and take possession 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these records but does not routinely do so. FDA typically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copies and takes possession of records only when they may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed for regulatory purposes. As a preliminary matter, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expects to continue that practice with regard to seafood HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public availability of those HACCP records that FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would possess as a result of copying during an inspection would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be governed by section 301(j) of the act and by the Freedom of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information Act (FOIA) and regulations issued pursuant to it by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and FDA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 301(j) of the act expressly prohibits FDA from disclosing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade secret information obtained during the course of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection. The FOIA regulations also say that FDA will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divulge either trade secret or commercial confidential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. As a preliminary matter, HACCP plans and monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records appear to fall within these two categories of protected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records. As a consequence, FDA may well have little discretion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this area. Moreover, under DHHS' FOIA regulations, processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be entitled to challenge in court a pending disclosure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records on the grounds that the records to be disclosed are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial confidential or trade secret. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an additional matter, there are significant legal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical questions as to whether FDA has the authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require disclosure of industry records that are not in FDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possession. As discussed elsewhere in this document, FDA does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not contemplate the submission of HACCP plans or other records to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA under these proposed regulations. The preapproval of HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans by FDA (and thus the submission of HACCP plans to FDA) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simply not practical. The agency has tentatively concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plans and monitoring records will be reviewed on site by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency investigators as part of FDA's normal inspection regime.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;123.8(e) to exempt tags as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.3(t) from the recordkeeping requirements of &sect;123.8. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the information on tags must be saved in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed requirements of this section and &sect;123.28(d), the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has tentatively concluded that it would be burdensome for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors to be required to retain the tags themselves for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended periods of time. NSSP now provides that processors are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to retain tags for 90 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

F. Training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;123.9 requires that each processor and importer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employ at least one individual who has successfully completed a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training course on the application of HACCP to fish and fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products processing. The agency has tentatively concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training is critical to the successful implementation of HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems in the seafood industry. Based on experience obtained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the FDA/NOAA HACCP pilot programs in 1991&hyph;92, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that a significant portion of the seafood industry will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be unprepared to meet the requirements of a mandatory HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program without some training. As discussed earlier, the pilot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program revealed a general lack of understanding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventive nature of HACCP, including misunderstandings about how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to establish critical limits, control measures, corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and recordkeeping procedures (Ref. 40). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A similar concern that the industry did not understand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of HACCP principles formed the basis for the training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in the agency's regulations for low acid canned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods. Improvements in canning operations can be attributed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant measure to the success of the training programs that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were established to implement that requirement (Ref. 54). NAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that the successful application of HACCP principles to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low acid canned foods was substantially the result of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training requirement in the regulations for those products (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
36, p. 309). The CGMP regulations for foods in part 110 also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
call for training in appropriate food protection principles (&sect;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
110.10(c)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The often seasonal nature, remote location, and small size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of many seafood processors also support the need for formalized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training. All of these conditions result in difficulty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recruiting highly qualified management and supervisory staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, FDA has tentatively concluded that proposed &sect;123.9 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to ensure that seafood processors and importers employ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least one person who is familiar with HACCP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations propose to require at &sect;123.9 that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person or persons at each importing and processing establishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who has received training be responsible for reviewing records of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control point monitoring, recognizing critical limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies, and assessing the need for corrective actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relative to the product in question and the HACCP plan itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While it is the intent of the agency to provide as much guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as possible to assist processors and importers, these activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require specialized training in the principles of HACCP, various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspects of food science, and the criteria of existing regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency anticipates that 2- or 3-day training sessions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modeled after the Better Process Control Schools currently in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place for low acid canned food and acidified food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, will be provided by various public and semiprivate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutions. The uniformity of this training can be assured by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a review of their contents and by periodic onsite monitoring by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency. Thus, FDA is proposing to require that the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of instruction be approved by the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While 2- or 3-day courses may well become the norm, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comment on whether the training requirement could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfied by different gradations of training, depending on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complexity or size of the operation, or on the degree of risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
posed by the product being produced, without compromising the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes for which training is proposed to be required. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, could training for a small business with few hazards be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished in a shorter time and at a lower cost through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of a video? FDA also invites comment on whether training in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP received before these proposed regulations become effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as final regulations should be ``grandfathered'' as fulfilling the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training requirement.

G. Sanitation Control Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10 that processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers that engage in processing perform sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections at specified frequencies and maintain sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control records that document the results and frequency of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections. If these regulations are adopted, the sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control records will be subject to the recordkeeping requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;123.8, including review by FDA investigators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For seafood, sanitary practices affect most directly the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of those products that do not receive any further cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the consumer. These products include raw molluscan shellfish; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finfish destined to be consumed as sushi; cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products; and certain smoked and salted products. Both finfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and shellfish are regarded as microbiologically sensitive foods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on the potential presence of pathogens, notably 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 55, pp. 31 and 32). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a pathogenic bacterium that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
widespread in the environment. Thus, the likelihood of finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it on the exterior surfaces and viscera of fish is high. Since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1983, several large outbreaks of human listeriosis have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
linked to contaminated foods. Although it is a relatively rare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illness, the exceptionally high mortality rate among susceptible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals makes this illness one of the leading fatal foodborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseases in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Numerous seafood products have been shown to support growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Refs. 56 and 57), and seafoods have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
epidemiologically linked to two outbreaks and one sporadic case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of listeriosis (Ref. 58). Furthermore, several cooked seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products have been recalled from the market in North America 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of contamination with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 27). Seven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of nine smoked fish processing facilities recently inspected by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA in New York State had 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the environment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the products (Ref. 59). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good sanitation practices are critical to the prevention of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listeriosis and other microbiologically related foodborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses. FDA's CGMP regulations for food in part 110 set out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general principles of sanitation that should be followed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants that manufacture, package, label, or hold human food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They address such matters as personal hygiene and cleanliness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among workers who handle food, the suitability of the plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design to sanitary operations, and the cleaning of food-contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surfaces. FDA inspections of seafood processors apply the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles in part 110. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nearly half of the consumer complaints relating to seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that FDA receives in a typical year are related to plant or food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hygiene (Ref. 60). The reasons, while not entirely clear, appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be related to factors such as the age of processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, the seasonal nature of operations that affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, and the turnover of personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A representative cross section of those FDA establishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection reports (EIR's) for domestic seafood manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that revealed CGMP deficiencies for fiscal years 1988&hyph;90 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates this point (Ref. 61). The cross section involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
795 EIR's covering 561 facilities. (The number of EIR's exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of facilities because followup visits were made to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
check on the status of corrective actions.) The following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentages refer to EIR's with deficiencies where at least some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the deficiencies involved sanitation: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Twenty-three percent documented receiving area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities that were not clean/orderly or in good repair. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Twenty-six percent documented facilities lacking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective insect and rodent control measures in the receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Sixteen percent documented failure to handle ice in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitary manner and to protect it properly.

(4) Thirty-five percent documented lack of adequate

cleaning or sanitizing of processing equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Twenty-one percent documented processing equipment that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not constructed so that it could be easily cleaned and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Eighteen percent documented processing equipment that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was not made of suitable materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Fifteen percent documented hand sanitizers that were

not kept at proper sanitizing levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Eighteen percent documented failure to have hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizers available in the processing area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Thirty percent documented processing areas that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not maintained in a clean and sanitary manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Forty-two percent documented processing areas with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exterior openings that were not sealed/covered properly to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent the entrance of pests or insects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Sixteen percent documented waste material not being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected/covered in suitable containers or not being disposed of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) Twenty-three percent documented handling of finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product in a manner that did not preclude contamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Twenty-two percent documented employees not taking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary precautions to avoid food contamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During fiscal years 1991&hyph;92, FDA conducted abbreviated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections of nearly all domestic manufacturers in its seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishment inventory. These inspections provide data on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation practices and conditions that are generally consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the above findings (Ref. 62). Examples of these data are: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sixteen percent of firms had problems with the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation condition of their processing areas. (This percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is lower than for item 9 above because the universe is all firms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not just firms with deficiencies.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Nineteen percent of firms did not clean and sanitize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their processing areas or equipment throughout the day's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production. (This matches most closely with item 4 above but is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower, presumably for the reason stated in the previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbered paragraph.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Twenty-eight percent of firms had employees that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not following proper sanitation practices in processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. (This figure does not precisely match any of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
items listed above because the EIR's break employee practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
down into specific categories, such as the wearing of hair nets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some categories involve relatively minor matters, others are more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant. Findings with respect to these employee practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not listed above for the sake of brevity.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Twenty percent had employees that were not following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper sanitation practices for packaging and finished product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage. (The parenthetical observations in the previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbered paragraph apply here as well.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Thirty-six percent of firms either lacked hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizers in their processing areas or had sanitizers that were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not kept at proper sanitizing levels. (This finding is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to a combination of items 7 and 8 above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surprisingly, this finding is roughly the same as 7 and 8 added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together, even though it includes all processors rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors with deficiencies.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sanitation problems found by NMFS during the operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its fee-for-service inspection program for seafood manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described earlier, are generally consistent with FDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings. Entrants into the NMFS program undergo initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation surveys by NMFS and are checked for sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices thereafter. NMFS' data show significant sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deficiencies during the initial surveys (Ref. 35, p. 40). Some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the most common for 1989 include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sixty-four percent of plants had discrepancies relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to proper cleaning and sanitizing of product contact surfaces or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, containers, or utensils after use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Fifty-one percent of plants had discrepancies relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to design, materials, or construction that prevented their being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained in a sanitary manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Forty-five percent of plants had discrepancies relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to design of equipment, containers, and utensils so that they did 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not provide protection from contaminants and could not be readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaned and effectively sanitized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Forty-three percent of plants had discrepancies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to improper storage of equipment, litter, waste, uncut 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weeds, and grass.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Forty percent had discrepancies relating to storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities that were not clean, sanitary, or in good repair. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 For established participants in the NMFS program (as opposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to entrants), the percentages with discrepancies in the above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas for 1989 were: 49 percent; 47 percent; 25 percent; 49 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent; and 33 percent (Ref. 35, p. 42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FDA has tentatively concluded on the basis of all of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
findings that HACCP-type controls for sanitation as proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below are needed. The sanitation measures required under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.10 are fundamental to good sanitation practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and can have a bearing on human safety. The agency recognizes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, that depending on the conditions in a facility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional measures may be necessary (see, e.g., part 110). FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will expect processors to include those measures in their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation practices but tentatively concludes that it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to include them in the fundamental core of required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FDA acknowledges the conclusion of the MSSP project that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for seafood at least, it is possible to include sanitation within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an HACCP system without unduly overburdening that system with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large numbers of critical control points. The FDA/NOAA HACCP-based seafood pilot program included critical control
points for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation. For these regulations, however, FDA has tentatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided to propose specific HACCP-type requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation, rather than require that processors identify critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control points for sanitation in their HACCP plans. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in &sect;123.10 potentially relate to an entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility, not just to a limited number of critical control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points. FDA tentatively concludes that this step is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fully implement section 402(a)(4) of the act and yet at the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time not overload the HACCP system. FDA invites comments on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In particular, FDA invites comment on whether sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements should be enumerated as in proposed &sect;123.10. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logical alternative would be to leave sanitation as one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures that is to be identified and addressed in HACCP plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the control of microbiological and physical hazards (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.6(b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(ix), and (b)(4)), but not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have specific provisions in the regulations as to how sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is to be achieved. Good sanitation blocks avenues for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduction of pathogens, harmful chemicals, and physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objects and is an essential preventive control for safety. Even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if a product is to be cooked by the consumer, the load of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological pathogens on that product when received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer is still relevant to safety. FDA's prescriptive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach to sanitation in proposed &sect;123.10 is intended to assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors to provide the greatest protection for consumers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, FDA invites comment on whether an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach as described above would ensure this protection at less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FDA is proposing in &sect;123.10(a) to require that processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct sanitation inspections to ensure that the sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions in &sect;123.10(a)(1) through (a)(17) are met. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes that the nature of the operations conducted by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor affects the hazards that may be presented by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. Processing other than storing usually involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manipulation of exposed, i.e., unpackaged, fish and fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. Both the manipulation and the exposure subject the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product to all the hazards that can occur from unsanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices. Storage, on the other hand, can subject the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to some, but nowhere near all, of the hazards associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insanitation. Consequently, FDA is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors of fish and fishery products inspect for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions in &sect;123.10(a)(1) through (a)(17) that are appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to their circumstances. FDA expects that, at a minimum, in, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, storage facilities, such inspections will include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring against the presence of vermin, because this is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequent problem in warehouses that can affect products even when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are being stored in a packaged state. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In &sect;123.10(a)(1), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors ensure that water that contacts the product or food-contact surfaces, or that is used in the manufacture
of ice, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
derived from a safe and sanitary source or is treated to render 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it of safe and sanitary quality. Water is used in virtually all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and fishery product processing facilities for washing raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials, product contact surfaces, and employees' hands. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to transport fish through the plant in water flumes. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, water is often an ingredient, as in soups and glazes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contaminated water can serve as a vehicle for contamination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product, both directly and indirectly (Refs. 63, 64; 65, p. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49; 66, 67, and 68, pp. 1 and 2). It can also serve as a vehicle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for contamination as the ice in which the product is stored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The safety and sanitary quality of water from United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and some foreign public water systems is generally ensured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through public water treatment, chlorination, or monitoring and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control by local health authorities. Where this assurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists, FDA does not anticipate that processors will need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement any additional controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Private sources of water, particularly surface waters or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water from shallow wells, may be subject to microbiological, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical, or radiological contamination attributable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source itself or to surface contamination at the well head or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intake. Private sources are also frequently untreated or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimally treated (Refs. 69, p. 15; and 70). Where the processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses a private source of water, it will need to take steps to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the water is of a safe and sanitary quality. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps may include retaining a copy of the initial local health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority well design approval and copies of the local health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority fecal coliform test results; obtaining and maintaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copies of private coliform test results; performing and recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodic inspections of the sanitary condition of the well head 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or source intake; and performing and monitoring appropriate water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment procedures, including filtration, sedimentation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chlorination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The type and frequency of controls exercised by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor should be based upon the type of source water and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historic safety and sanitary quality. Consequently, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is proposing to require, in &sect;123.10(c)(3), that such controls be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed and documented at such frequency as necessary to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control. In &sect;123.10(a)(2), as a means of ensuring that potable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water does not become contaminated, the agency is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that the processor ensure that there are no cross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connections between the potable water system and any nonpotable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. Nonpotable systems include waste water and sewage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cross connections, which include situations that allow for back 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
siphonage into a potable system from a nonpotable system under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative pressure conditions, can result in the chemical or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological contamination of the potable water system (Refs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
64; 65, pp. 50 and 51; 68, 71, and 72). For example, if a hose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a potable water system is left in a thawing tank with water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and frozen fish, and if negative pressure occurs that draws water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the tank back through the hose to the potable water system, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both the potable water line and the water source itself, i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the municipal or private water system, can become contaminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Cross connections can best be controlled by performing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodic inspections of the potable and nonpotable systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These inspections should be performed at least every time that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a change in the plumbing of the systems and with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient additional frequency to ensure that unintentional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross connections do not develop. Consequently, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(c)(3), the agency is proposing to require that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections be performed and documented at such frequency as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to ensure control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 FDA is proposing in &sect;123.10(a)(3) to require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor ensure that all food-contact surfaces are designed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructed, and maintained in a manner that minimizes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for chemical and microbiological contamination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. Utensils and equipment can be vehicles for microbial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination of both the raw and finished products. Utensils, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, and other food-contact surfaces that are made of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosive material or wood, or that contain breaks, pits, cuts, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or grooves, may harbor pathogenic microorganisms that can migrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the product and contaminate it. These kinds of surfaces are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to clean, with the pores and crevices shielding the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms from the action of cleaning and sanitizing agents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 65, pp. 20, 36&hyph;48; 72, pp. 166 and 167; and 73).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, where food-contact surfaces are constructed of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxic materials (e.g., lead shucking blocks), the product may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly contaminated with the toxic material (Ref. 74). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA tentatively concludes that it is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that processors take affirmative steps to minimize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility that any risks will be created by the utensils and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment they use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proper construction of the equipment should be ensured at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time it is received, and whenever it is modified or repaired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The frequency of subsequent inspections necessary to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sanitary condition of the equipment has not declined with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time will depend on the frequency of its use, the materials and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction methods, and the nature of its use. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(c)(3) the agency is proposing to require that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls be performed and documented with such frequency as is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to ensure control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(a)(4), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor ensure that food-contact surfaces are regularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaned and sanitized with cleaning and sanitizing preparations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are suitable for this purpose. Surfaces that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately cleaned and sanitized can be a source of filth to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent products produced on the equipment, an attractant for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vermin, and a reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infrequent cleaning of equipment can result in the formation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biofilms, microscopic films in which microorganisms can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrapped, shielded from the action of sanitizers, and physically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bound to the food-contact surface of the equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An effective cleaning compound is one that will lower the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface tension of water so that spills can be lifted and flushed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
away. Ordinary soap is generally ineffective for equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing because of its limited ability to solubilize fats, oils, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and proteins. Mildly alkaline detergents are generally suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for cleaning seafood processing plants, but high alkaline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detergents are often necessary for heavy buildups of fats and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proteins. Mineral deposits will frequently require the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acid cleaners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An effective sanitizing agent is one that has a good 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bacteriocidal effect on the types of pathogens normally present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the plant environment and is safe, stable, and convenient for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. Examples include hypochlorites, iodophors, and quaternary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ammonium compounds (Refs. 73, 74, 75, 76, and 77). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To eliminate the product residue that accumulates on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product contact surfaces during production, FDA is proposing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(a)(4)(i) to require that utensils and surfaces of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment that contact food during processing be thoroughly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washed at the end of the day's operations. FDA is also proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;123.10(a)(4)(iii) that sanitizing be performed on the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utensils and equipment immediately before the beginning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production, so that any recontamination that occurs between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning and production can be eliminated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(4)(ii) that, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those operations in which microbiological contamination can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely affect the safety of the product (e.g., the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of cooked, ready-to-eat products), the equipment also be washed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and sanitized at least every 4 hours during processing. Washing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and sanitizing with this frequency is necessary to inactivate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mesophilic pathogens, such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella spp.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, before they leave 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lag phase of growth and enter the rapid log phase (Ref. 23). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Temperatures in fish and fishery product processing plants are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally not low enough to control the growth of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms and are certainly not low enough to control the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth of such psychrotropic pathogens as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Refs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
23, 78, 79, and 80). Therefore, FDA tentatively finds that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing and sanitizing equipment every 4 hours is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require both cleaning and sanitizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because neither step is fully effective without the other. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizing occurs without benefit of cleaning, pathogenic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms can be protected from the action of the sanitizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by food residue. Conversely, while cleaning can effectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove product residue and a portion of the microorganisms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizing is generally needed to remove the remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms (Refs. 81 and 82). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(c)(2) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor inspect the condition of the utensils and surfaces of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment that contact food immediately after each cleaning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizing. The purpose of the inspection is to ensure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequacy of the cleaning and sanitizing operations, and to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the equipment is in a condition that is suitable for further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is also proposing in &sect;123.10(c)(2) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor document the time of each cleaning and sanitizing, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of the sanitizer, and the condition of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. Documentation of the time of each cleaning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizing will facilitate an assessment of compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency requirement of &sect;123.10(a)(4). Documentation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of the sanitizer will facilitate an assessment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the adequacy of the sanitizing operation. Sanitizers must be of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient strength to be effective, while excessive sanitizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations can contaminate the product with indirect food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives (21 CFR part 178) (Ref. 82). Documentation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of the equipment is necessary to ensure that it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examined after cleaning and sanitizing to make sure that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes were done properly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is proposing in &sect;123.10(a)(5) to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor ensure that gloves and outer garments that contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the food or food-contact surfaces are made of an impermeable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material and are maintained in a clean and sanitary condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gloves or aprons that are made of cloth or other porous materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are difficult to clean and may serve as a reservoir for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogenic microorganisms that can migrate to the food during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing, in much the same manner as previously described for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing equipment (Refs. 65 and 83). Gloves and aprons that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not maintained in a clean and sanitary condition can also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
house pathogens that can migrate to the food. Therefore, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively finds that it is appropriate to require the measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set out in &sect;123.10(a)(5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At &sect;123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
like most of the other sanitation measures that FDA is proposing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sanitary condition and impermeability of gloves and outer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
garments that may contact the food or food-contact surfaces be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checked at least daily while processing operations are occurring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such checking will ensure that employees arriving for work are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with gloves and outer garments that will not serve as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source of contamination to the product. It will also ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees are never using personally owned gloves and garments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are made of materials that are unsuitable for the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. Proposed &sect;123.10(c) also requires that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checking be documented on a daily basis to provide a record that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such checking has occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;123.10(a)(6), the processor must ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that employees' hands, gloves, outer garments, utensils, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food-contact surfaces that come into contact with insanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objects are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before contacting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish or fishery products. Under proposed &sect;123.10(a)(7), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor must also ensure that employees' hands, gloves, outer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
garments, utensils, and food-contact surfaces that contact raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before they contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Employees and food-contact surfaces can serve as vectors in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the transmission of filth and pathogenic microorganisms to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food. Filth and pathogenic microorganisms can be brought into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing environment on the employees' hands from outside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas, restrooms, contaminated raw materials, waste or waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receptacles, floors, and other insanitary objects (Refs. 63, 64, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
73, 74, 84, and 85). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bacteria naturally present on fresh fish skin and gills and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the gastrointestinal tract reflect the microbial content of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the water from which the fish were harvested. Typical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms found on and in fresh fish include 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enteric bacteria, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrio parahaemolyticus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, salmonella, shigella, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hepatitis A, and other microorganisms that pollute harvest waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 7). These microorganisms contaminate the environment in

processing plants and cannot, using reasonable methods, be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completely eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proper precautions, such as proper hand and equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning and sanitizing, must be taken to minimize opportunities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for contamination of the finished product (Refs. 63, 64, 73, 74, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 84). Therefore, FDA is proposing in &sect;123.10 (a)(6) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a)(7) that such precautions be taken with respect to hands, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gloves, garments, utensils, and food-contact surfaces.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency recognizes that not all processing activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will require hand washing and sanitizing. Activities that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not require such steps include the handling of raw fish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery products prior to the initial washing step (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly from the fisherman) and the handling of finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products in shipping cases. These activities are exceptions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, to the general rule that employees must thoroughly wash 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and sanitize their hands after each contact with an insanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface. Additionally, when insanitary objects come into contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with product contact surfaces, they must be thoroughly cleaned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and sanitized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the processing of cooked products, the raw material may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also serve as a reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms. For this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason, employees or equipment that handle or touch the raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material must be cleaned and sanitized before being used with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked product or ice, or they could convey the microorganisms to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these foods (Refs. 63, 64, 73, 74, 84, 87, and 88). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(c)(1), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sanitary practices of the employees, especially as they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relate to hand washing, sanitizing practices, and the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for cross contamination, be checked and recorded at least every 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours during processing. This monitoring will ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees arriving for work and returning from the midshift break 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have properly washed and sanitized their hands. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of hand sanitizing solutions tends to be reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the course of a production day because of the reaction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sanitizer with organic matter and dissipation as a gas (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
82). It will also cause a regular assessment of the adequacy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the normal operating procedures. Finally, recording will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance that appropriate procedures are being followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(a)(8)(i), FDA is proposing to require that hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing facilities be located in all processing areas in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing and sanitizing is required by CGMP's so that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities are readily accessible to employees who work in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing areas. The agency has tentatively concluded that proper sanitization is such an important part of preventing
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spread of disease as to warrant a requirement that hand washing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment be conveniently located to facilitate their use. Where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these facilities are not conveniently located, they may not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequented by the employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(8)(ii) that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities be equipped with hand cleaning and effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizing preparations and single-service towels or suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand drying devices. Ordinary soap is acceptable for hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing. Hand sanitizers need to be fast acting because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short contact time involved. In contrast to the sanitizing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, which can involve leaving a sanitizing spray on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment for extended periods of time, hand sanitizing usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involves a quick dip in and out of the sanitizer. Of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizers described previously (see discussion of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(a)(4)), quaternary ammonium is not fast acting and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not suitable as a hand sanitizer. The others are appropriate as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand sanitizers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is proposing to require single-service towels or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable hand drying devices to ensure that microbiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination does not occur though the repeated use of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
towel by several individuals. A hot-air blower is an example of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a suitable hand drying device because contamination from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual to individual is eliminated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(c)(3), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection and documentation of the location of hand washing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities be performed at sufficient frequency to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is compliance with &sect;123.10(a)(8)(i). Generally, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure will be necessary only after construction or any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant building or process modification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(c) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor inspect, and document that it has inspected, the hand 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washing and hand sanitizing facilities to ensure that they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly equipped no less than once per day. This procedure will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that cleaning and sanitizing preparations, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
towels or hand drying devices, are present whenever needed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.10 (a)(9) and (a)(10) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the processor protect the food, food-contact surfaces, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food packaging materials against adulteration by chemical and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical contaminants. Such protection is necessary to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the food produced by the processor is safe. The use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxic compounds (e.g., pesticides, cleaning and sanitizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents, and lubricants) is frequently necessary in the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. For example, lubricants and fuel are necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate equipment. Improper use of these compounds is a frequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause of product adulteration throughout the food industry (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
74). Thus, it is necessary to ensure that food, food-contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surfaces, and food packaging materials are not contaminated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these toxic compounds. Food and food packaging material should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be protected or removed from areas where pesticides are used, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caustic cleaning compounds should be thoroughly removed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food-contact surfaces before processing begins. Finally, as an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional protection, FDA is proposing to require in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(a)(10) that toxic compounds be labeled, held, and used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a manner that minimizes the risk of contamination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(c) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing plant be inspected daily to ensure that the food is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protected from toxic compounds, and that this inspection be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented. This check should normally be performed before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
start of operations, at a time when the equipment can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively inspected, and in time to prevent adulteration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. Because processing conditions vary on a day-to-day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, FDA has tentatively concluded that daily inspection is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.10(a)(11) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor ensure that products are not exposed to contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may drip, drain, or be drawn into the food. An example of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a contaminant is condensate, which may form on the ceilings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and equipment in a processing plant. If the condensate forms on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an insanitary surface and then falls on the product, it may carry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with it filth and microbiological contaminants from that surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the food (Ref. 65, pp. 24 and 25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing plant be inspected daily to ensure that the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for such contamination is minimized, and that this inspection be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented. This check should normally be performed during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual operations, at a time when condensate or other such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminating conditions are likely to be present. As explained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above, the agency has tentatively concluded that daily variations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in processing and climatic conditions necessitate daily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(a)(12), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor ensure that compressed gases that contact food or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food-contact surfaces of equipment are filtered or treated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a way that the food is not contaminated with unapproved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indirect food additives or other chemical, physical, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological contaminants. Compressed gases can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated with oil from the compressor, filth and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological contaminants from the air intake, and rust or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other physical contaminants from the compression, storage, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution equipment. Filtration at the air intake and after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compression, storage, and distribution is an effective means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reducing the risk of such contaminants entering the food (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
89).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(c)(3) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filtration and other equipment used to protect the food from such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants be inspected, and the inspection documented, with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such frequency as is necessary to ensure control. Normally, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency will be directed by the manufacturer of the filtration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment. FDA is not proposing to require daily inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the filter and related equipment do not normally need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaning or replacement on a daily basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(13) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor take action to ensure that unprotected cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products, smoked fishery products,
raw molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish, and raw fish and fishery products are physically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separated from each other during refrigerated storage. Cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready-to-eat products are products that will not normally receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a cooking by the consumer adequate enough to kill pathogens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, any microbiological recontamination of the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after cooking can subject the consumer to health risks. Raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molluscan shellfish may contain pathogens that can cause severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illness to certain at-risk individuals, e.g., those who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immunocompromised. These individuals might know to avoid eating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw molluscan shellfish but would not expect the same health risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from cooked, ready-to-eat products. Similarly, raw fish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery products may contain filth and pathogenic microorganisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not normally associated with raw molluscan shellfish or cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready-to-eat products (Refs. 63 and 84). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated storage areas be inspected at least daily to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the three types of products are physically separated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each other. This check should normally be performed during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual operations, at a time when commingling of these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is likely to take place. The agency has tentatively concluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that daily inspection is necessary because products are normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moved in and out of refrigerated storage areas on a regular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis, creating an ongoing threat that problems will occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(14) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated storage units operate at 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when storing raw materials, in-process or finished cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products, smoked fishery products,
and fish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery products made in whole or in part of scombroid toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forming species. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that processors control microbiological hazards associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated storage for these products (Refs. 85 and 86). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cooked, ready-to-eat products as defined in proposed &sect;123.3(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoked fishery products (see Appendix 1) are not shelf-stable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and must be kept refrigerated to retard the growth of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms. As stated above, these products will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normally be cooked by the consumer at a sufficient temperature to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroy any pathogens that may be present. Scombroid toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forming species are addressed in considerable detail later in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this document. These species can form a toxin harmful to humans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if subjected to time/temperature abuse after capture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proper refrigeration is essential for fish and fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products that include these species. Maintaining product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures during storage in a range that will minimize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth of mesophilic and psychrotropic pathogens is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure product safety throughout the shelf life of these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 85). It is uniformly more convenient to control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration unit temperatures than to control and monitor the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal temperatures of the various products under refrigerated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage, particularly when these products are in sealed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers. For these reasons, FDA is proposing that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration units be operated at or below 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C). FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively finds that this temperature is appropriate because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is adequate to minimize the growth of pathogens (Refs. 85 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
86.) The agency also strongly recommends this temperature or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower for all fish and fishery products that need refrigeration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of whether safety is an issue. The agency is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially interested in obtaining comment on the appropriateness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(c)(4) the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor use instruments that monitor the temperature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration units on a continuous basis. The measurements from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those instruments must be checked and documented with such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency as is necessary to ensure control.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuous monitoring ensures that temperature fluctuations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), if any, as a result of circumstances such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as heavy cooler loading, frequent cooler entry, or power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failures, are quickly detected. The guideline for cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, in Appendix A, section 6, describes alternative ways to continuously monitor the temperature. A temperature-recording
device can show both the high temperature and the length of time that refrigeration unit was operating at that temperature.
Maximum-indicating thermometers and high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature alarms also show that the critical limit has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeded but cannot show the duration of the deviation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, when a maximum-indicating thermometer or high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature alarm reveals a deviation, the processor will need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assume loss of control since the last time that the measurements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displayed by the instruments were checked, unless reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence exists to the contrary. The more frequent such checks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are made, the lower the risk to which the processor is exposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During periods when the refrigeration unit is not frequently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entered and the load is constant, such as overnight, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable to reduce the frequency. However, during periods of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heavy use and frequent entry, the frequency should be increased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(15) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor ensure that persons with sores or illnesses that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present an increased risk for product contamination are excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from those areas of processing where such contamination is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely. Employees can serve as a reservoir of foodborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseases, such as salmonellosis, shigellosis, and hepatitis, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be passed on to the consumer through the fecal-oral route. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, open sores, boils, or infected wounds present the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for contamination of the food with such pathogenic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Staphylococcus aureus. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Employees with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspicious illnesses or sores can be effectively screened upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrival at the processing facility with minimal personal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intrusion (Refs. 22, 74, and 84). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screening, and documentation of the screening, take place daily. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This frequency will ensure that changing health conditions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees are not missed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(a)(16), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor ensure that toilet facilities are available and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained in a sanitary condition and in good repair, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these facilities provide for proper disposal of the sewage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toilet facilities eliminate from the processing environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogenic microorganisms shed in fecal material. Where fecal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material is not properly conveyed from the processing plant to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable treatment facility, restroom floors and grounds around 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing facility can become contaminated with pathogens. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Foot traffic over the affected areas can introduce pathogens to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing room and cause product contamination. Insanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toilet facilities can also increase the potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination of employees' hands and, ultimately, the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 64 and 74). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.10(c) that the toilet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities be inspected, and the inspection be documented, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that they function properly and are in a sanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition at least every day. Ordinarily this inspection should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be performed before each day's operation to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility is ready at the beginning of the day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(a)(17), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor ensure that no pests are present in the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area. Pests, such as rodents, birds, and insects carry a variety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of human disease agents, which they can introduce to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing environment (Refs. 63, 64, 73, and 84). Additionally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their feces constitutes filth which can contaminate the food. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily inspection of the processing facility, as proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(c), serves to assess the effectiveness of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor's pest control activities and redirect them where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In &sect;123.10(a)(18), the agency is proposing to require that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor ensure that the plant is designed to minimize risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of contamination of the food. Proper construction is essential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the other sanitary measures that FDA is proposing to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are to be successful. It includes the isolation of incompatible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations, such as the handling of raw materials and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of cooked products (Refs. 71, 74, 87, and 88). A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodic inspection of the facility for structural defects, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product flow, and general building condition is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that these attributes do not pose an increased potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for product contamination. In &sect;123.10(c)(3), the agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to require that such controls be performed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented with sufficient frequency to ensure control.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing to require at &sect;123.10(b) that processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain sanitation control records that document the occurrence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and findings of the inspections required by &sect;123.10(a) as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the frequency required by &sect;123.10(c). FDA is also proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require that the problems found during these inspections be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected, and the corrections recorded in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.10(d). Such corrections are essential to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper working of the HACCP system. The records that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced are subject to the recordkeeping requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.8, including being subject to inspection by FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigators. FDA has tentatively concluded that HACCP-type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventive controls, including recordkeeping, will ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hazards caused by insanitation are controlled by design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recordkeeping is the key to an HACCP-type system. The agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to these records is essential to ensuring that the system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is working. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these proposed requirements, FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encouraging processors in &sect;123.10(e) to have a written standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating procedure for sanitation. The details of many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation procedures can differ from plant to plant depending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the type of operation and other conditions. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how a piece of equipment should be cleaned can differ from plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to plant. In one plant, it may be necessary to disassemble all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or part of the equipment in order to clean it. In other plants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breaking down the equipment may not be necessary. Likewise, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different cleaning compounds may be needed from one plant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another in order to solve specialized problems such as buildups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of mineral deposits. FDA is therefore encouraging each processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to study its own plant and develop a procedure that is tailored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to that processor's needs and circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. Evisceration of Raw Fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1988, following botulism outbreaks traced to consumption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of kapchunka, FDA published compliance policy guide (CPG) 7108.17 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for salt-cured, air-dried, uneviscerated fish (53 FR 44949 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 7, 1988). In this CPG, FDA stated that the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and sale of smoked and salted uneviscerated fish products pose a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential health hazard, and that it would consider such products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act in that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
175). FDA issued this CPG in an effort to prevent further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outbreaks, as well as other potential health hazards, related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the consumption of ungutted fish products. The agency recognized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only two exceptions: (1) Small species, such as anchovies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
herring pieces (sprats), provided that they are processed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method that will ensure a water-phase salt content of at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 percent, a water activity below 0.85, or a pH of 4.6 or less; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (2) fish that are fully cooked before further processing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously noted, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, as well as other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms, are naturally present in the intestinal tract of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both fresh-water fish and marine fish. Therefore, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential not only to remove the viscera but to do so in a manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that does not contaminate the fish flesh with viscera contents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the viscera that can contain the majority of the hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms (e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pose the potential health hazard (Refs. 165 through 167). After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the viscera is removed, it must be discarded immediately to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
segregated area, using a method that minimizes the potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination or cross-contamination of utensils, equipment, raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials, and other processed products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uneviscerated fish that have been smoked, smoke-flavored, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salted, and that are intended to be filleted after processing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pose the same potential health hazard as those products sold as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uneviscerated whole fish. The potential health hazard is created 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when the viscera is removed after processing. As the fish are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being filleted, the viscera may be cut, and its contents may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spill out, contaminating the processed fish. As a result, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity arises for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spore outgrowth and toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production as well as for growth of other food spoilage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms in these types of products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agency is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(f) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, subject to the same limitations that were set forth in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CPG: (1) All fish for smoking or salting be eviscerated prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to processing, and (2) the process of evisceration must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed in an area that is segregated and separate from other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Imported Seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated earlier, imports make up over half of the seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumed in this country, in sharp contrast to meat and poultry, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are primarily domestically produced. Many of the hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can affect imported seafood are likely to occur before it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enters the United States. These hazards include those that can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be acquired from the environment before harvest and those that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are process-induced. Detection of these hazards is the focus of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current regulatory system, and thus FDA tries to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety by testing imported product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, product testing places a substantial burden on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency. The system currently is overburdened because of limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the number of government personnel available to collect and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyze samples of imported product. In addition, FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned because this system does not promote industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility and accountability the way an HACCP-based problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevention system would. Given when most problems with imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood occur, these problems can be more efficiently controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the seafood is subject to HACCP controls before it is offered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for import into this country than if the product is simply tested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the time that it is offered for sale. Therefore, FDA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively concluded that these HACCP regulations should cover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported products in the same manner, to the extent possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they cover domestic products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, FDA is proposing to make importers subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the general provisions of subpart A. Thus, FDA is proposing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.11(a) to require that products that are offered for import 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be produced under the same HACCP and sanitation controls that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is proposing to apply to domestically produced seafood. FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to require that importers adopt an HACCP plan that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes the criteria for how they will decide to purchase and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
then handle seafood while it is under their control. They must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also establish ways to determine that these requirements are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More specifically, the plan must include hazard analysis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points, and critical limits for each type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product imported as well as a copy of each supplier's HACCP plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for those products, as required in &sect;123.11(b). Under proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.11(b), these plans must be available on file at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importer's U.S. place of business. As stated above, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is developing a hazard analysis book to assist importers, as well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as processors, in designing their individual plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the proposed requirement of &sect;123.11(b) that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers must have on file an HACCP plan from each of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreign suppliers, foreign processors who wish to offer their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products for import into the United States after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of this regulation will have to operate under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valid HACCP plans and sanitation control procedures and furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
copies of those plans to the U.S. importers. The foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors should maintain appropriate monitoring records, as dictated by the principles of HACCP already discussed.
These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records should be kept at the foreign processors' places of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Importers will be required under proposed &sect;123.11(c) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take affirmative steps to monitor that their suppliers are in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fact operating under their HACCP plans. Thus, under this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, the importer will need to take such steps as: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Obtaining records from the foreign processors' facilities; (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtaining certification from foreign governments that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suppliers are operating under valid HACCP plans or obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification lot by lot; (3) visiting the facilities to inspect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them on a regular basis; or (4) taking some similar type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action, e.g., end product testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, importers of swordfish may specify to their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suppliers that the mercury level in the swordfish that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchase cannot exceed FDA's action level of 1 part per million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methyl mercury. The importers may decide to require certificates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of analysis for methyl mercury on a regular basis from their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suppliers as a means of ensuring that the swordfish that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offer for import into the United States is not adulterated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 123.11(d) provides an option for those importing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a country that has an active memorandum of understanding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(MOU) or similar agreement with FDA. If the MOU is current, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if there is equivalency between the inspection system of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreign country and the U.S. system, the importer will be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rely on the MOU in lieu of the actions required under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.11(c). An active MOU must accurately reflect the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation between the signing parties and be functioning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforceable in its entirety. It is the importer's responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine whether the MOU is in fact active, and whether it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covers the products that the importer intends to receive from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the agency strongly encourages importers (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected in proposed &sect;123.11(e)) to require their suppliers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtain HACCP training such as is required in &sect;123.9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;123.12 provides that there must be evidence that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood offered for import has been produced in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 123, subpart A. As stated previously, FDA is including this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement to ensure that there is equivalent treatment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported and domestic products. FDA can ensure that domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product is being produced in accordance with the HACCP plan and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sanitation controls in &sect;123.10 through direct observation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and review of records. Similar inspection of foreign processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be prohibitively expensive. However, FDA tentatively finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that mere reliance on the existence of an HACCP plan is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough, and that additional evidence of compliance must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided. FDA tentatively finds that this evidence can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the means listed in proposed &sect;123.12(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the ways that the agency contemplates obtaining this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence would be by inspecting, at the importers' U.S. place of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business, the importers' and foreign suppliers' HACCP plans, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation procedures, and records associated with the importers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans. If these records demonstrate that the foreign processor and the importer are operating in accordance with
adequate HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans, agency will have assurance that the food is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also intends to pursue MOU's with countries that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that their inspection systems are and continue to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially equivalent to those in the United States (proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.12(a)(2)). The existence of an active MOU between FDA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the country of origin covering the seafood products being offered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for import will provide assurance that these products covered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the MOU are being produced under appropriate conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there is no MOU, the agency will take into consideration, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for purposes of verifying the compliance of imported seafood, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge that a foreign country has an advanced seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection system that provides for plans that are HACCP based, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as provided in proposed &sect;123.12(a)(3). The existence of such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory system and its enforcement will provide assurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the conditions under which products exported from that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
country are being produced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;123.12(a)(4) provides that inspection of foreign 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors by the agency or other organization designated by FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may also be used to establish compliance with these regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the agency intends to use other measures as it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finds appropriate to make determinations about the acceptability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the product being offered for import, including but not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to end product testing, as in proposed &sect;123.12(a)(5).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require in part 123, subpart C that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors of raw molluscan shellfish include in their HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans how they control the origin of the molluscan shellfish that

they process. Proposed &sect;123.28 requires that these controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include obtaining raw shellfish only from approved growing waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through harvesters or processors licensed by a shellfish control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority. FDA is proposing to require that processors maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records to document that each lot of raw molluscan shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets these requirements. Under this proposal, these records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will constitute HACCP records subject to the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is also proposing to establish a system of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tagging or other labeling that provides information about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
origin of all shellstock and shucked molluscan shellfish received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a processor. FDA is proposing to amend &sect;1240.60 (21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1240.60) to provide for such a tagging system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Raw molluscan shellfish are molluscan shellfish that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not been subject to a treatment sufficient to kill pathogens of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health significance. Shellfish that have been subjected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to any form of treatment, such as steam, hot water, or dry heat, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a short period of time before shucking to facilitate removal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the meat from the shell are still considered to be raw.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Molluscan shellfish consumed raw or partially cooked pose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unique public health risks. They probably cause the majority of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all seafood-related illnesses in the United States (Refs. 6; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7, p. 330). The safety of raw molluscan shellfish directly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects the cleanliness of its aquatic environment. Of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
edible species of fish, molluscan shellfish are unique in that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are nonmotile, filter feeding organisms. They pump large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantities of water through their bodies during the normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feeding process (Refs. 7, p. 331; and 90, p. c-4). The positive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between harvesting areas contaminated by sewage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollution and shellfish-borne enteric disease has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated many times (Refs. 7, p. 76; 91 and 92). During 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feeding, the shellfish may concentrate pathogenic microorganisms, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deadly toxins associated with naturally occurring marine plankton 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 93), or forms of agricultural and industrial pollution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 94). Among the pathogenic microorganisms is the Norwalk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
virus, probably the most common cause of seafood-borne illness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This virus commonly occurs in waters contaminated by sewage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effluent (Refs. 7, p. 76; 91, 92, and 95). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the adoption of the current public health controls in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States, shellfish commonly transmitted many serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communicable diseases. Consumption of raw or undercooked seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from polluted waters can be a mode of transmission for typhoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fever, infectious hepatitis, and cholera (Ref. 67). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseases are still commonly associated with raw shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption in lesser developed countries (Ref. 7, p. 73). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the incidence of these diseases in the United States has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been largely controlled under section 361 of the PHS Act (42 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 264). This statute was enacted to prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under provisions of the PHS Act, FDA is empowered to accept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assistance from the States to protect public health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, FDA participates in a Federal/State cooperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program called NSSP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Established in 1925, the NSSP provides water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for assessing the safety of shellfish growing areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These criteria are applied by the States under the authority of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their own laws. The NSSP ``Manual of Operations'' provides the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis (Refs. 90 and 96) for State regulation in 23 shellfish-producing States and 6 nations. Each participating State
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nation classifies and monitors its shellfish growing waters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls harvesting, inspects shellfish packing and shucking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, and issues certificates to individual shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors that meet the State or foreign government's shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control criteria.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist themselves in the implementation of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish laws, the States have formed the ISSC. The ISSC is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organization of State officials, representatives of Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies, and representatives of the shellfish industry. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides guidance to the States and provides a forum for them to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discuss their problems in attempting to ensure the sanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of shellfish handling and production (Ref. 97, p. 3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA evaluates State and international shellfish sanitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs (Ref. 98, part I, p. 2). When it finds that the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is consistent with the NSSP, FDA accepts the State's or country's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipper certifications. FDA publishes the ``Interstate Certified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shellfish Shippers List'' monthly, in which it lists the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 2,000 shellfish dealers that have been certified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participating States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While FDA continues to believe in the cooperative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partnership that it has established with the States, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence that this system is not protecting the public health as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as it might (Refs. 7, p. 331; 99, p. iii; and 100). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Problems can originate anywhere. As explained in the discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above of the term ``lot of molluscan shellfish,'' the water from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which shellfish are harvested plays a significant role in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining their safety. If they are harvested from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unclassified or polluted waters, shellfish can be a vector of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communicable disease. Problems can also occur as a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions under which the shellfish are held on the harvest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel, in the processing plant, or by subsequent handlers or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repackers of shucked products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the current situation, FDA has tentatively determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it is necessary for it to take steps to strengthen and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide additional support for the existing cooperative program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, FDA is proposing two measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, FDA is proposing to add &sect;1240.60(b), which will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that all shellfish offered for transport or transported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in interstate commerce bear a tag that lists the date, place, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type, and quantity of shellfish, and by whom it was harvested, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the harvester's identification number. FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing this requirement because it has determined that a tag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the only means by which the agency can ensure that it will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible to determine whether the shellfish have been taken from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe water. FDA is proposing to require that the place where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish were harvested be listed because it will enable a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor who receives the shellfish, or a regulatory official 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who inspects them, to determine whether they were taken from safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require that the date when the shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were harvested be listed because, as discussed above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shifting conditions in shellfish harvesting waters make shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety virtually a day-to-day proposition. Therefore, when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish are harvested becomes a critical factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing that the type of shellfish e.g., oysters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clams, mussels, or scallops, and quantity be shown on the tag or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bill of lading to ensure that the tag is applied only to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product to which it was initially affixed. Information on type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and quantity of shellfish describes that product. FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to require that the person by whom the shellfish were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvested be listed because that person has the most direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
knowledge of where and when the shellfish were harvested and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be readily identifiable in case there are problems with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shellfish, so that quick action can be taken to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of any problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, FDA is proposing that the harvester identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number issued by the shellfish control authority be included to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a means to confirm the harvester's identity and to obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harvester's local address in case of an illness investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or followup to tagging and labeling discrepancies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing this tagging requirement under section 361 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the PHS Act. Under this section, the Surgeon General and, by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delegation, FDA, is authorized to make and enforce such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations as in FDA's judgment are necessary to prevent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA tentatively finds that requiring a tag is a measure necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent the spread of communicable diseases because the tag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will readily permit identification of those raw shellfish that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were harvested from properly classified waters, and thus that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be vectors of communicable disease in interstate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce, and those that were not harvested from properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified waters and thus that may be vectors of disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the PHS Act, FDA is also authorized to provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such measures which in its judgment may be necessary to enforce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulations that it adopts to prevent the spread of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communicable diseases (section 361(a) of the PHS Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA is proposing to provide in &sect;1240.60(b) for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seizure and destruction of any shellfish that are not properly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tagged. Without the assurances provided by the tag, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish may bear a microorganism that may render them injurious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to health. Thus, they are unfit for consumption and must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed from the food supply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA recognizes that all shellfish-producing States have laws 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that require the tagging of shellfish. This proposal is intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to support those laws, not supersede them. The proposed tagging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement is necessary for two reasons. First, there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance that untagged shellfish come from safe waters. Illegal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvesting of molluscan shellfish from contaminated or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unclassified waters is known to occur (Ref. 7, p. 331). It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also known that illegally harvested shellfish find their way into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial channels. States and FDA find untagged or improperly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tagged shellfish during their inspections of shellfish processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the cooperative program (Refs. 101 through 109). FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently lacks a basis for taking action against untagged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish (Ref. 110). Proposed &sect;1240.60 will provide a basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, State tagging requirements and sanctions are not uniform, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the sanctions provided under some State laws have little 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deterrent effect (Refs. 102, 103, and 109). The establishment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a Federal sanction will provide illegal harvesters with sure knowledge that if their catch enters interstate commerce
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comes to the attention of FDA, it will be destroyed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If &sect;1240.60(b) is adopted, as a practical matter, product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification will begin at the harvesting site. FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing to amend &sect;1240.60 to require that the first handler of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
live molluscan shellfish, be it the licensed harvester, licensed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aquaculturist, or certified shellfish shipper, affix a tag to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each container of shellfish. The tag will then provide the means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for processors to ensure that the shellfish that they buy is from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly classified water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the tag will provide all information that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to trace the product to its source, e.g., date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvest, location of harvest, quantity and type of shellfish, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harvester's name and identification number assigned by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish control authority. The product traceability that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results will enhance epidemiological investigations in the event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of shellfish-borne illness. It will also facilitate prompt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedial actions necessary to reestablish public health controls. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety concerns about shucked molluscan shellfish are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially the same as those discussed above for in-shell 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molluscan shellfish. Because shucked shellfish are packaged in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container that can be labeled, the agency is proposing to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;1240.60(c) that for these shellfish, a label may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituted that bears information equivalent to that found on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the tag. Another reason for allowing labeling in lieu of a tag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the fact that one bag of unshucked molluscan shellfish bearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a single tag can typically be processed into more than one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container of shucked molluscan shellfish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second measure that FDA is proposing is based on its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience with the NSSP and the ISSC. FDA has tentatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that the system for protecting the safety of shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be significantly strengthened if the agency were to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that certain limited steps be taken as part of the processing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish that are intended for interstate commerce. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that these measures, like the proposed tagging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement, will serve to strengthen the Federal-State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperative program as well as the shellfish safety programs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the States and countries that participate in NSSP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many of the pathogens in shellfish, such as the Norwalk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
virus, are virtually undetectable. Moreover, from a technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and practical perspective, end product testing cannot be used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing of shellfish to ensure that they are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated with one of the myriad of possible domestic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial, and agricultural contaminants that have been found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish harvesting areas. Therefore, State classification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growing waters is a necessary first step to ensure the safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish. These classifications, as detailed in NSSP, address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all actual and potential pollutants in deciding whether an area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is suitable for harvesting (Ref. 90, pp. c&hyph;5 and c&hyph;6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing in &sect;123.28(a) that each processor of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish have an HACCP plan that ensures that the molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish that it processes come only from areas that have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified by a shellfish control authority as satisfactory for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvesting. As noted above, the safety of molluscan shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumed raw or partly cooked is predicated on the cleanliness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the growing area waters from which they are obtained. Ensuring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that shellfish come from properly classified growing areas is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where shellfish safety begins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under proposed &sect;123.28(b), processors are to process only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish that originate from growing waters that have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved for harvesting by a shellfish control authority as shown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by product tags or labels with specific information that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes that they were harvested from appropriate waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing this requirement under both section 361 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PHS Act, to prevent the spread of communicable disease, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 402(a)(1), 402(a)(4), and 701(a) of the act to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the food does not contain any added substances that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
render it injurious to health and is not prepared, packed, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held under insanitary conditions whereby it may be rendered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injurious to health.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under proposed &sect;123.28(b)(2) and (b)(3), the shellstock tag 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a licensed harvester or certified processor, or the bill of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lading accompanying bulk shipments, will contain the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required under proposed &sect;1240.60(b) and thus document whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shellfish are from an acceptable source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed requirement &sect;123.28(b) that only shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drawn from such acceptable sources can be processed will place a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
premium on properly tagged products from shellfish dealers that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States or nations that participate in NSSP have certified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is further proposing to require in &sect;123.28(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that shucked products be subject to the same requirements that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to shellstock. FDA is doing so because the safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shucked shellfish products, like shellstock, depends on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of the water where they are grown. Therefore, the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is further proposing to require in &sect;123.28(d) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor maintain records that document that each lot of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish meets the tagging or labeling requirements in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.28 (b) or (c) (see Refs. 104 and 108). The information that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is proposing to require to be maintained in records simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects these requirements. Permanent records are needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that processors are controlling the origin of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish they process. In addition, permanent records will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate epidemiological investigations by allowing complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product traceability to the source of origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The protection of shellfish consumers also requires that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
domestic and imported products be treated equally. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imported raw molluscan shellfish are subject to the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards as domestic shellfish with regard to adulteration and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misbranding, Federal law does not require that imported shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
come from waters that were classified by a public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority. This double standard is unfair to domestic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors, and both ISSC and industry representatives have urged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Government to address this problem (Refs. 111 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
112). While virtually all States have chosen to reject imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish that are not tagged as coming from classified waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 113), it is known that such shellfish nonetheless enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interstate commerce (Ref. 107). Untagged imports originating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from uncertified producers compromise the effectiveness of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood safety programs (Ref. 7, p. 73) and product traceability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA is proposing that all raw shellfish products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either from domestic or foreign origin must comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in part 123 and &sect;1240.60. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, if &sect;123.28(b), for example, is adopted, it will mean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that only those molluscan shellfish that are harvested in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreign country that has a program that incorporates the type of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures set out in the NSSP for approving growing waters will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for processing. Such a program will need to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures that provide for water classification, monitoring, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other related activities if it is to ensure that the growing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters that it approves are safe, and thus that the shellfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are drawn from such waters are not adulterated. FDA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that the best way to establish that a foreign country's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program meets this standard is through the development of an MOU 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the agency and that country. Currently, such agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist with Australia, Canada, Chile, England, Iceland, Japan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Republic of Korea, Mexico, and New Zealand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, FDA anticipates that these proposed requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will improve the safety of raw molluscan shellfish by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing uniform requirements for domestic and imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products and prohibiting interstate movement of shellfish that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not properly tagged to demonstrate that it came from an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate harvesting area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effectiveness of State shellfish sanitation programs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NSSP will be strengthened by the proposed mandatory tagging, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling, and recordkeeping requirements, which will allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete product traceability to its source of origin. Should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses occur, product traceability will facilitate a rapid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of when a problem occurred and allow immediate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remedial actions to restore public health controls. Also, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring proper tagging or labeling will place a premium on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and foreign shellfish sanitation and processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification programs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Guideline for Cooked, Ready-to-Eat Fishery Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing a guideline in Appendix A for cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready-to-eat fishery products. These products possess an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elevated microbiological risk relative to most other seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products because they are cooked as part of processing and do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normally receive any additional cooking by consumers before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption. Consequently, to be safe, these products must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essentially pathogen-free by the time they leave the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. Immediate refrigeration at proper temperatures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent the growth of pathogens is also essential for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, which are not shelf-stable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guideline addresses critical control points that apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to these products as a class and that thus will typically be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in the HACCP plans of most processors of cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready-to-eat products. The guideline also addresses ways of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlling hazards at each critical control point. Processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of cooked, ready-to-eat products that are also smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products should apply the controls
set forth in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix 1. If FDA adopts that regulation, it will codify it in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reserved subpart B of part 123. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This guideline is not relevant to most of the cooked, ready-to-eat products that are processed as low acid canned foods
under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 113. However, the recommendations in Appendix A, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. a., b., and d. for cooling, processing after cooking, and refrigerated storage, will apply to those low acid canned
foods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are cooked, processed, and then cooked again. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guideline provides information on how to control the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
during the processing step between cooks. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also addresses the control of microbiological hazards that can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occur within the processing environment for cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. It does not address nonprocessing hazards, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are not relevant to this class of products. FDA intends to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publish separate guidance that will, among other things, address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonprocessing hazards. Likewise, this guideline will not address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the nonsafety hazards, such as decomposition that is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with human illness and economic adulteration, that FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has suggested in proposed &sect;123.6(c) should be covered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plan. These hazards will also be covered in the separately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published guidance. Economic adulteration, for example, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed in Appendix D. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has tentatively decided to address the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls for cooked, ready-to-eat products in a guideline, rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than by regulation, to permit flexibility in the face of changing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing technologies and knowledge. As stated earlier in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble, the guidelines are intended to advise processors about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what FDA believes will be acceptable in a HACCP plan. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledges, however, that there are basic processing norms to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which conscientious processors adhere, and that these norms are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not likely to change for the foreseeable future. FDA therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comments on whether any or all of the guideline on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked, ready-to-eat products ought to be codified as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in part 123 if it is adopted as a final regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Thermal Processing: Cooking and Pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Processes and Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed guideline in Appendix A, section 4 advises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors on how to ensure that: (1) Their cooking and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization processes are adequate to inactivate pathogens; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (2) their cooking and pasteurization equipment is adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to deliver their cooking and pasteurization processes. A cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is, in essence, the temperature and time at that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature that will both kill pathogens and create a marketable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. A pasteurization process is the temperature and time at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature that is necessary to reduce the numbers of pathogens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the point where they will not cause harm over the shelf life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a refrigerated product. It is essential that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
type E not survive the pasteurization process for cooked, ready-to-eat products that are packed in hermetically
sealed containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and held at refrigerated temperatures (Ref. 52). Such containers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are typically vacuum or modified atmosphere packaged and thus can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide a good environment for the growth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
type E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To meet the requirements in part 123, subpart A, processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must have assurance that their cooking and pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes are adequate to inactivate pathogens and must document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this assurance in their HACCP records. This approach is similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to that in the regulations for low acid canned foods, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require that processors of those products know that their thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes are adequate to destroy 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The low acid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canned food regulations do not specify to processors what their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature parameters must be in order to destroy those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogens. There are simply too many variables and possibilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with regard to thermal processing parameters for this kind of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specificity in those regulations to be practical or appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather, the regulations require that processors use a thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process that is at least equivalent to one established by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competent process authority, i.e., a third party who has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise to determine the parameters of a thermal process that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will destroy pathogens (Ref. 85). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This approach has served the consuming public, the agency, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the industry well over the years. FDA is therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommending in proposed Appendix A, section 4. a.1. and b.1. that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors utilize the services of process authorities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish the parameters of their cooking and pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A process authority could be a private individual, a member 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of academia, or an agency of government. Processors can find 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competent process authorities through their trade associations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local Sea Grant extension offices, or State universities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures that are used in establishing a cooking or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization process should be generally recognized and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted. Such procedures may include thermal death time, heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penetration, and inoculated pack studies, as necessary, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish the minimum process necessary to destroy pathogens. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases where the cooking process or pasteurization process is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardized and not unique to a specific processor, articles in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
journals; Federal, State, or local regulations and guidelines; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other appropriate vehicles could provide process parameters (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
52). Whatever the source, processors must retain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation from the process authority that the process will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective as part of their HACCP records, in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.8(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process established by a process authority should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include values for those aspects of the process that can affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the destruction of pathogens. The most notable of these are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking times and temperatures. Others may include the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal temperature of the cooking medium before the cooking, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product size and species, and the viscosity of formulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products such as soups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is already aware that the cooking processes necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create a marketable product for several types of cooked, ready-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to-eat products are many times more lethal than necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inactivate pathogens (Ref. 114). The products are the several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of crabs listed in the guidelines at proposed Appendix A, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 4.a.4. FDA has tentatively concluded that, for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, the adequacy of both the cooking process and cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment can be assumed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is likely that other products could be added to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list. The agency invites comments on this point. Comments should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be accompanied by data that will enable the agency to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the minimum cooking process necessary to achieve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marketable product, e.g., heat penetration data and data on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range of cooking processes (times and temperatures) applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that product, will produce a safe product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same general principles also apply to the design of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking and pasteurization equipment. It is necessary that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment be designed and operated so that every unit of product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives the established minimum cooking or pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process proposed (Appendix A, section 4. a.2. and b.2.) (Ref. 85). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recommends that the equipment be evaluated for design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation by a process authority who is familiar with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dynamics of temperature distribution in processing equipment. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some instances, temperature distribution studies may be necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to establish the adequacy of the equipment. In other instances, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing literature should be sufficient. Processors must obtain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and retain documentation that the equipment will provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum process as part of their HACCP records in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Container Integrity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed guidelines advise in Appendix A, section 3. c. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and d. that HACCP plans prepared in accordance with part 123, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A will normally identify finished product container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sealing for pasteurized products and postpasteurizing cooling as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points. Contamination with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
type E 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the postpasteurization cooling step is a special food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety hazard that must be controlled for pasteurized products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two potential causes of recontamination are poor container seams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and contaminated cooling water. Consequently, the guidelines, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A, section 5, recommend controls that processors can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilize that are likely to meet the requirements of subpart A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A, section 5.a. advises processors how to inspect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product containers of pasteurized products for container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity to ensure a consistently reliable hermetic seal. At 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed Appendix A, section 5.b., the guidelines advise about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing for the presence of sanitizer in cooling water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seam inspections should determine whether the seams conform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the manufacturer's guidelines. Additionally, because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variations from seaming head to seaming head, from closing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machine to closing machine, and over time for any one machine or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
head, FDA recommends that processors conduct inspections for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
machine and head at least every 4 hours. Visual seam inspections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not adequate to fully assess the integrity of the seam. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Physical testing and, in the case of double seams, seam teardown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and measurement, are necessary parts of the inspection, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presently required for low acid canned foods in part 113. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The presence of sanitizer in cooling water provides a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control for the risk of microbiologically contaminated water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being drawn into the can. A vacuum created by a collapse in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling vat of the steam head in the container, generated during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the heating step, can draw in a minute amount of cooling water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and any pathogens contained in that cooling water. Seams are in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a particularly stressed condition at that time. Sanitizer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strength levels should be checked periodically because there is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tendency for variation in strength to occur, particularly in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
batch-type systems.

3. Time and Temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The guidelines advise, in proposed Appendix A, section 3. e., f., g., and h., that HACCP plans prepared in accordance
with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A of part 123 will normally identify cooling after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking, processing after cooking, final product cooling, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated storage, as critical control points. The potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists for some pathogenic microorganisms to survive the cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, regardless of the controls that are in place at that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
step. Likewise, despite a processor's efforts to minimize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recontamination of the cooked product with pathogens, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential exists for some pathogens to be reintroduced. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these reasons, it is imperative that exposure of the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the cooking process to temperatures that permit the growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of pathogens be kept to a minimum, since larger numbers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently associated with a greater potential for disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To control hazards as required by part 123, subpart A, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process must take steps to restrict time/temperature abuse of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked product to the point that pathogens such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spp. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
do not enter the rapid (logarithmic) phase of growth. By 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restricting pathogen growth to the slow (lag) phase, pathogen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers should remain constant or increase only slightly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Appendix A, section 6.a. provides a way to control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the growth of pathogens immediately after cooking. It advises 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, after cooking, the product should be cooled from 140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) to 70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (21.1 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) within two hours. This time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination is based on the upper limit for growth (i.e., 140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the lower limit for rapid growth (i.e., 70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mesophilic pathogens as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella spp.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typical length of the lag phase for the former microorganism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 23, 85, and 115). However, 70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (21.1 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) will not fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control the growth of psychrotrophic pathogens. Consequently, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further cooling from 70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (21.1 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) to 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) within 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional hours is advisable, based on the minimum growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures of such psychrotropic pathogens as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Salmonella spp.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
S. aureus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and the lag time of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spp.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Refs. 23, 78, and 79). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These cooling recommendations are generally consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those of the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of USDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 115) and the National Food Processors Association (NFPA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 78). FDA invites comments on the specifics in App. A, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 6.a. In those instances where further processing takes place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the achievement of the 70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (21.1 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or the 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) temperatures, further reduction in temperature need not take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place. There is no need for production delays when in-process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage times are normally less than the 2 or 6 hours needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve each of these temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The time/temperature parameters employed to control the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological hazards associated with cooling after cooking can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be confirmed by a program of routine time and temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring (Appendix A, section 6.a.1.). Real time documentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this monitoring should be done to facilitate management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternately, the ability of the firm's processing procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consistently achieve the appropriate time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters can be confirmed through scientifically conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature studies that take into consideration the range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of processing variations encountered at the firm. Examples of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing variations include product size, e.g., the range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shrimp sizes that the firm typically processes; the temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the cooling medium, e.g., the highest temperature normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experienced in the firm's cooling unit; and the amount of product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normally placed in the cooling unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some instances in-process time/temperature monitoring may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be impractical or needlessly redundant, particularly in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous processing systems. A scientifically conducted study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is especially appropriate for such situations, where it can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assured that in all plausible situations the time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters will be met. Documentation and retention of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct and results of this study is required by &sect;123.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A, section 6.b. advises how processors can ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that microbiological hazards associated with postcooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing can be controlled. It advises that products not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to ambient temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or higher for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than 4 hours during postcooking processing, again based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the minimum growth temperature of such psychrotropic pathogens as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and on the normal lag phase of such mesophilic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogens as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella spp.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The agency recognizes that, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many products, manipulation of the product after cooking, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
undesirable from the standpoint of microbiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recontamination, is necessary for many cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. It is often impractical to perform this manipulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under refrigerated conditions. Consequently, the product will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to some combination of time and temperature that may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow for microbiological growth. The recommended conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will minimize the growth of pathogenic microorganisms and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of heat stable toxins (e.g., staphylococcal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enterotoxin). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ability of the firm's processing procedures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistently achieve its time/temperature parameters can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirmed by monitoring the length of time that the product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to such ambient temperatures. Documentation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature monitoring must be in accordance with &sect;123.8. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to facilitate management and regulatory review.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix A, section 6.c. advises how processors can ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that microbiological hazards associated with final product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling can be controlled. Following the manipulation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product during postcooking processing, it will be necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor to cool the product to a temperature that will not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support the further growth of mesophilic or psychrotropic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogens. This result can be achieved by cooling the finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product to an internal temperature of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) within 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours of either placing it in the finished product container or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completing pasteurization. Again, the recommendation is based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the minimum growth temperature of such psychrotropic pathogens as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and on the normal lag phase of such mesophilic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogens as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella spp
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Of specific concern to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization process is the reduction of the internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the product to a level that will not support the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growth of any surviving spores of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, type E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ability of the firm's processing procedures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistently achieve its time/temperature parameters can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confirmed by a program of routine time and temperature monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to address the particulars of the firm's processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. Real time documentation of this monitoring should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
done to facilitate management and regulatory review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternately, the firm's ability to consistently meet its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters can be confirmed through scientifically conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature studies that take into consideration the range 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of processing variations encountered at the firm. Examples of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these processing variations include container size, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the cooling medium, and the amount of product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normally placed in the cooling unit. In many instances, in-process time/temperature monitoring may be impractical
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expensive for sealed finished product containers. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientifically conducted study is especially appropriate in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations, where it can be assured that in all plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situations the time/temperature constraints will be met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Documentation of the conduct and results of the study is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under proposed &sect;123.8 to facilitate management and regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Temperature control during refrigerated storage is best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved through the use of temperature indicating and recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices and recordkeeping, as stated in Appendix A, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.d.2. (Ref. 85). However, FDA recognizes that some processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may desire to manually monitor the temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration unit, using only a temperature-indicating device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a logbook. When coupled with a high temperature alarm or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum-indicating thermometer, the agency feels that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice represents an acceptable alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guideline advises, in Appendix A, section 3.i., that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plans prepared in accordance with subpart A of part 123 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will normally identify distribution as a critical control point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distribution of perishable products encompasses the same hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as associated with refrigerated storage. For this reason, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A, section 6.e., the agency is recommending a critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit of an internal temperature maximum of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encouraging the shipper and consignee to arrange for appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes that distribution patterns vary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerably from single shipments to pooled and multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivery shipments, from iced shipments to refrigerated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipments, and from shipments on the consignee's truck to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipments on the shipper's truck to common carrier shipments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each mode presents different opportunities and impediments for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Temperature Monitoring Equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Processors must monitor and control the temperature of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration units in order to ensure that microorganisms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health concern do not increase in numbers. Likewise, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors must control the times and temperatures of their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal processes in order to ensure that the minimum thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is consistently delivered to the product. The guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
address the outfitting of cooking, pasteurization, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration equipment with temperature indicating and recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices (Appendix A, sections 4. a.2.ii. and b.2.ii., and section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.d.2., respectively). A temperature-recording device provides a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete history of the temperature throughout the thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process by continuously recording it on a chart. As has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated for low acid canned foods, the chart itself provides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an excellent HACCP record for the benefit of both processor and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulator. For this record to be meaningful, it is critical that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the temperature-recording device sensor be installed so as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurately represent the temperature of the heating or cooling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medium.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Temperature-recording devices are easily jarred and rendered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inaccurate. They can be calibrated and corrected against a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating device (e.g., a thermometer) quite easily, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however. Processors should do so at least at the beginning and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of each production day in order to determine whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument was accurate throughout the day's production. In this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
situation, the temperature-indicating device serves as reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument since it is much more reliable. Consequently, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-recording device should never show a higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature than the temperature-indicating device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Temperature-indicating devices are generally reliable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need only be calibrated upon installation and annually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereafter. Calibration should be against a standardized (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traceable to the National Bureau of Standards) thermometer that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not subject to the rigors of the processing environment (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
85). Temperature-indicating devices must often be read under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than ideal plant conditions, so they should be installed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a location that facilitates easy reading. As with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-recording device, the sensor on the temperature-indicating device should be installed so as to accurately

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent the temperature of the heating or cooling medium.

5. Corrective Actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix A, section 8. advises processors about corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action steps that they should consider to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed corrective action requirements in &sect;123.7 of subpart A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the evaluation of critical limit failures relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking step and the terminal heat treatment step of cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready-to-eat products may well require an understanding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technical aspects of thermal process calculations, Appendix A, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 8. recommends additional controls to those required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.7 in this regard. Of primary importance is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation that any corrective action other than processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to eliminate the hazard or destruction must be assessed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competent process authority. For this purpose, a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority may be a representative of the firm or may be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outside source, so long as the process authority has a scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
background that is adequate to make the assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

6. Sanitary Zones 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 123.10 of subpart A establishes requirements for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors for sanitation within the processing environment. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to these requirements, this guideline recommends in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A, section 8. that processors of cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products establish sanitary zones in their facilities. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency invites comments on the merits of this concept and on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether it should be codified in the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The importance of good sanitation in the processing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked, ready-to-eat products cannot be overemphasized. While, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as has been stated earlier, plant sanitation has no real bearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on human food safety for many foods, the safety of cooked, ready-to-eat products can be easily jeopardized by pathogens
that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced through poor sanitation practices. Consequently, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is recommending that processors establish sanitary zones around 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas where products that have already been cooked are being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handled or stored. The primary purpose of a sanitary zone is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physically separate insanitary objects from cooked products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sanitary zones can also minimize the likelihood of airborne contamination through proper filtration and positive
air pressure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the zone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 A sanitary zone is a separation of operations by location, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
partition, air flow, or enclosed systems. In most cases, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires procedural changes to minimize the risk of contamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not large-scale structural changes. Canada has successfully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated the concept of sanitary zones for seafood processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of its HACCP-based inspection program (Ref. 116).

K. Guideline For Scombroid Toxin Forming Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is proposing a guideline in Appendix B for handling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the species in which scombroid toxin can form. This problem is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily, but not exclusively, associated with members of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family Scombridae. The fish involved contain significant levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of naturally occurring free histidine in their flesh, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain bacteria can decarboxylate into histamine. Significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine levels occur when the fish are exposed after death to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times and temperatures that permit the growth of these bacteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Histamine can result in a mild to severe allergic response in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans. Scombrotoxin poisoning is one of the three most common 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood-related illnesses (Ref. 5, p. 24). The scombrotoxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species that have been associated with foodborne illness include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tuna, bluefish, mahi, mackerel, sardines, herring, kahawai, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anchovies, and marlin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 This HACCP guidance is intended to maximize the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls to ensure proper handling of scombrotoxic species and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thus to minimize the possibility of a problem. It also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes the often complex pathways of movement and ownership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through which such fish may pass. Failure to ensure safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling at any point in the chain may render the fish injurious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 There is a basis for concern about the safety of the fish as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soon as histamine begins to form. Once the histamine-forming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process has begun, it is like a chain reaction. Lowering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of, or freezing, the fish will slow or arrest the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, but only cooking and prevention of recontamination can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stop it (Refs. 9 and 117). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The guideline describes a HACCP system that emphasizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliance upon accurate recordkeeping to show continuity of proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling. Accurate knowledge of the time/temperature history of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish is very important in determining the likelihood that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish are unsafe or may become unsafe. The guideline also calls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for more stringent processor controls to be applied to lots for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which records are inadequate. While this guideline is designed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent problems, nothing in it should be construed as meaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the agency will not take regulatory action if it finds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposed fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The guideline in Appendix B, section 2. identifies receipt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of raw materials, which include imported shipments, as a critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control point for processors of scombroid toxin forming species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Time/temperature abuse by the fisherman can result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposition and the resultant production of histamine.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Decomposition can also occur before the fish are removed from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the harvest water if the fish dies in capture nets or on long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lines. In such an event, the degree of decomposition will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect the sea temperature, time in the water, and particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species (Ref. 118). It is not uncommon to encounter water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures of 80 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F to 90 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F in tropical waters, which can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce rapid decomposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Thus, rapid cooling of fish when they are captured is very 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important to prevent initiation of the process by which histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is produced. Fish subjected to 68 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F for periods as short as one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day, a practice which can happen in warm climates on fishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessels, will yield high levels of histamine, even if the fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are later stored at refrigerated temperatures (Ref. 117). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 For these reasons, the guideline advises that processors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and fishery products from scombroid toxin forming species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must ensure that their raw materials are essentially free of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposition and histamine as a result of time/temperature abuse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that occurred before the processor received them. The guideline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides for three interrelated controls for the processor to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply with regard to raw materials. For the first processor that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takes ownership after harvest, these are: (1) Time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records from the harvesting vessel (Appendix B, section 3.a.1.); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) organoleptic examination of the fish from the harvesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel for decomposition (Appendix B, section 3.a.2.); and (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine analysis, if warranted by the time/temperature history 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the fish as revealed by the time/temperature record from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel or by the results of the organoleptic examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Appendix B, section 3.a.3.), or both. Time/temperature records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the vessel indicate whether entire lots from the vessel may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be suspect, and thus in need of a histamine examination, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of unusual events on the vessel. Such records would not normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reveal, however, whether there are individual fish in the lot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may have decomposition. An organoleptic examination for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposition serves to screen individual fish. It also serves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a way to verify the time/temperature records from the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with regard to an entire lot. If organoleptic examination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reveals an unusually high number of fish with decomposition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entire lot should be considered suspect and subjected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Appendix B, section 3.a.1. provides for how the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor can take measures to determine whether the fish were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly harvested and handled on board the harvesting vessel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certification of the mode of capture, including information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time between physical capture and bringing the fish on board, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling techniques, and the use of temperature logs onboard the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel that record that time/temperature history of the fish (for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, catch date and time, means and rate of cooling, storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature, and refrigerated brine or seawater temperature) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide documentation to the processor and to regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorities that the fish were properly handled. Such records on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the handling of the fish should be part of an HACCP system and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be used in the specific HACCP plans of processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The harvester's goal should be to bring the fish to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal temperature of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below as soon as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible after the fish dies to minimize the risk of histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production. Cooling fish below 59 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (15 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), and preferably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), greatly reduces the growth of populations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the bacteria that are most likely to cause histamine formation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 7, p. 95). Once bacterial growth has begun, temperature at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or below 41 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (5 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) halts bacterial growth, although enzymatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine formation may slowly continue (Ref. 7, p. 95). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, in proposed Appendix B, section 3.a.1., the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is recommending a slightly lower flesh temperature of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below. This temperature is consistent with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations of safe temperatures in other sections of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulation. Nonetheless, FDA specifically invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on the appropriateness of this temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B, section 3.a.1. recommends that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature history from the vessel be on a lot-by-lot basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and defines a lot as a discrete storage compartment on the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in keeping with industry practice. A lot typically reflects a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day's catch. Because a boat's catch can be subject to varying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions and treatment from day-to-day, the time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records should be specific to each lot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the time/temperature records suggest that, for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular lot, the conditions on the vessel were likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause, or significantly contribute to, the formation of histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the fish, or if no adequate time/temperature records exist for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lot, the guideline provides that a representative sample of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish from the lot be analyzed for histamine Appendix B, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.a.2.ii.B.). The samples should be collected on a statistically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valid sample schedule because variations in time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
abuse are likely at various points in a ship's hold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second control, organoleptic examination by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor for decomposition, should be performed regardless of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what the time/temperature records show (Appendix B, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.a.2.). First, decomposition is a form of adulteration under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
403(a)(3) of the act. Second, as indicated earlier, an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptic examination provides a screening mechanism for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual fish. It is possible for the conditions on the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be good but for some fish to develop decomposition anyway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, also as stated earlier, an examination for decomposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides a way to verify the time/temperature records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that an organoleptic examination of each fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be highly impractical. Consequently, the guideline calls for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an examination of a representative number of fish to achieve a 95 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent certainty that the total number of fish in the lot that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhibit decomposition does not exceed 2.5 percent. (The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significance of 2.5 percent is addressed in the preamble 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of Appendix B, section 3. a.2.iii. and a.2.iv.) Using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this approach, the number of fish examined will be reasonably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
close to the total number of fish, so that the goal of screening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual fish is preserved to the maximum extent practicable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, FDA expects that this representative sample will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large enough so as to provide a sufficient verification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature records for the entire lot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B, section 3.a.2.i. provides that no fish flesh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that exhibits any organoleptically detectable decomposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be used for food. Aside from the clear violation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
402(a)(3) of the act presented by such decomposition, the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health risk presented by decomposition in scombrotoxin forming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species is unacceptable. While the existence of decomposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not mean that scombrotoxin is present, it does mean that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process has begun that can lead to the presence of scombrotoxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the shelf life of the fish or fishery product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some instances, e.g., large fish such as tuna, isolated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts of the fish will exhibit decomposition but other parts will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be free of decomposition. FDA recognizes that it is possible to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remove those parts of a fish that have decomposition and salvage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the remainder. Appendix B, section 3.a.2.i. provides for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reconditioning so long as a histamine examination is performed on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the flesh that is free of decomposition. FDA believes that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine test is prudent under such circumstances to verify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombrotoxin forming processes are not at work in that flesh. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guideline also provides for how the processor should use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptic examination and time/temperature records in tandem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine whether fish or fishery products from scombroid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forming species are fit for further processing or should first be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to a histamine examination. If no decomposition is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found, and the time/temperature records show that conditions on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vessel were unlikely to cause, or significantly contribute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to, the formation of histamine in the fish, all the fish from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lot may be further processed or directly entered into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce (Appendix B, section 3.a.2.ii.). If, as stated earlier, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the time/temperature records are inadequate or indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions that could cause histamine, the processor should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always conduct a histamine analysis on a representative sample 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of the decomposition findings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If decomposition is found in less than 2.5 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lot, and the time/temperature records show that conditions on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel were unlikely to cause, or significantly contribute to, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the formation of histamine in the fish, Appendix B, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.a.2.iii. provides that the decomposed fish should be removed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the procedure outlined in Appendix B, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.a.2.i., but that it is not necessary to subject the lot to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine examination. The agency has tentatively concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decomposition below 2.5 percent is not significant in terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the acceptability of the entire lot. Under the best conditions, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is possible that some fish in a large lot will experience some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimal decomposition. Under these circumstances, so long as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish with decomposition are culled from the lot, there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason to suspect that the lot has been subject to unusual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions that could cause histamine or scombrotoxin to form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is aware that the canned tuna industry uses the 2.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent value to determine whether special handling of a lot is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warranted (Ref. 119). The canned tuna industry has concluded, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
just as FDA tentatively concludes, that levels above 2.5 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent likely exposure of the fish in a lot to conditions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are out of the ordinary and potentially dangerous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, if the processor finds decomposition in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than 2.5 percent of the fish from a lot, those fish must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed from the lot, and a histamine examination needs to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed on a representative sample of the remaining fish in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lot (Appendix B, section 3.a.2.iv.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to recognize that where the time/temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records are inadequate for all the fish on a vessel, or show poor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions for all the fish from a vessel, histamine analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be performed on representative samples from each lot on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vessel. Although an appropriate number of fish for sampling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could possibly be provided from a single lot, the results would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be representative of the vessel as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B, section 3.a.3. describes how fish should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposed of depending on the results of a histamine examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In keeping with current policy, the agency expects that any fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is found to have histamine above a defect action level or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other regulatory level or limit for histamine established by FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be used for food. Moreover, the agency expects, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflected in Appendix B, section 3.a.3.i., that a finding of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine over such level or limit in any fish in a lot from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel will result in the destruction of that entire lot, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of the percentage of decomposition that was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptically detected or the conditions on the vessel as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated by the time/temperature records. Such a histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding strongly indicates that neither the records from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vessel nor the decomposition test (if the results were below 2.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent) are reliable. Histamine may be present in the absence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of organoleptically detectable decomposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the agency expects, as reflected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B, section 3.a.3.ii., that a finding of histamine below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the action level, but higher than is normally found in fresh fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 120 and 121), in any fish in a lot will result in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate cooking of all the fish in the lot to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombrotoxin will not form over the shelf life of the fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cooking stops the histamine forming process once it has started. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without this cooking, any elevated temperatures later in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution system or in the home can result in a rapid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elevation of histamine levels to hazardous levels (Ref. 117, p. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
341). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix B, section 3.b. addresses raw materials controls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that can be exercised by subsequent processors, i.e., those other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than the first processor to take possession of scombroid toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forming fish and fish products from a harvester. Assuming that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first processor has met its responsibilities with regard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw materials as explained above, and has not caused a problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through improper handling during processing, subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors should determine whether decomposition occurred during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer from the previous processor. Consequently, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guideline provides, at Appendix B, section 3.b.1., that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent processors that do processing other than simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storing, should subject a representative sample of fish or fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products from each lot to an organoleptic examination. Any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finding of decomposition in that sample should lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptic examination of the entire lot. If decomposition is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in more than 2.5 percent of the fish in the lot, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor should perform a histamine examination on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sample of fish from the lot. These gradations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the expectations reflected in the guidelines for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first processors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has tentatively concluded these measures need not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken by those who only store fish and fishery products. While 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature abuse can occur during storage, and thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombroid toxin forming species must be &blank;held &blank;at &blank;appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&blank;temperatures (40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below), the hazard of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombrotoxin in the finished product can be controlled by those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
who own the product or manipulate it during processing.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As suggested above, time/temperature abuse can occur during processing as well as before the raw materials are received.
It is important that processors identify critical control points and suitable controls that will protect fish and
fish products that can form scombrotoxin from time/temperature abuse. As the guideline for scombrotoxin states
in Appendix B, section 5., many of the controls for time and temperature in the guideline for cooked, ready-to-eat
products should be applicable to the processing of scombrotoxin forming species. Such handling conditions are necessary
to control histamine production. In addition, Appendix B, section 4. provides that products that are undergoing
processing not be exposed to ambient temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4

&cir;C) or higher for more than 4 hours during that processing. The agency recognizes that for many products, manipulation
under unrefrigerated conditions is necessary. The processor must be aware, however, that during such periods the
product will be exposed to conditions that can lead to histamine formation. Appendix B, section 4. describes how to
minimize this possibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To comply with Appendix B, section 4., the processor should monitor the length of time that the product is exposed to
ambient temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F or higher. Documentation of the time/temperature monitoring controls will facilitate management and regulatory
review.

1. Economic Adulteration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Economic adulteration occurs when a consumer is misled about the worth, amount, or identity of a food product and,
therefore, unknowingly pays for value not received. Economically deceptive practices in the representation of
a food's value may occur in a number of ways. Sections 402(b) and 403 of the act define the conditions and practices that
result, respectively, in the economic adulteration and misbranding of a food. In addition, the Fair Packaging and
Labeling Act, 15 U.S.C. 1451 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
requires that food packages and their labeling provide consumers with accurate information about the identity and
net quantity of the contents, so that consumers can make fair value comparisons among products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While any food may be subjected to economic adulteration or to misbranding, fish and fishery products present distinctive
characteristics and processing procedures that make them more susceptible to abusive economic practices than most
foods. The great variety of finfish, shellfish, and crustacean species, as well as the multiplicity of products prepared
from them, including fabricated surimi-based products that imitate actual seafoods, provide ample opportunity
for both inadvertent and deliberate economic adulteration and misbranding practices that result in economic loss
to the consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most important among the characteristics that make seafoods vulnerable to abuse is the similar appearance of many
finfish, in the whole, raw state, in the form of fillets, or as ingredients. Unlike the situation with the limited types
of red meats and fowl, it is very difficult for most consumers to detect the substitution of an economically inferior
species for a more valuable one that is declared on the label or in labeling (e.g., the substitution of rockfish for
red snapper). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Irrespective of the relative economic value of the substitute species, section 403(a)(1) of the act states that a
food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its labeling is false and misleading in any particular. More specifically,
a food is misbranded under section 403(b) of the act if it is offered for sale under the name of another food. If the substituted
fish is less valuable than the species represented on the label or labeling, the product is also adulterated under
section 402(b)(2) of the act, which states that a food shall be deemed to be adulterated if any substance has been substituted
wholly or in part therefor. Consequently, it is a clear violation of the act when a finfish, shellfish, or crustacean
is not correctly identified on its label or in its labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the misidentification of species may also have adverse public health consequences. Should an illness
or outbreak occur from a seafood product, it is essential for proper diagnoses and treatment that public health investigators
not be prevented from quickly identifying the exact cause or agent responsible in the food, and from tracing it back
to the correct source of the food to prevent further sale and consumption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, in a seafood related incident that occurred in 1982, in New York, two men became ill shortly after eating
a fish dinner in a restaurant. Species substitution caused investigators to erroneously suspect that the illnesses
were caused by ciguatoxin because the food was identified as being red snapper, a species which could cause that illness.
The food actually was mahi, a fish which is often associated with scombroid poisoning (Ref. 122). Scombroid poisoning
is associated with high levels of histamine.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA found that the fish mislabeled as red snapper had been shipped from Ecuador and processed in Panama. Had the fish
been labeled as mahi, it would not have been permitted entry into the United States because FDA had an automatic detention
for mahi from Ecuador at the time because of problems with high levels of histamine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another instance involving species substitution resulting in a negative public health consequence occurred in
Hawaii in 1987. Fifty illnesses, 32 of which required medical attention, were attributed to the consumption of limpets
misbranded as ``Baby Abalone.'' The symptoms displayed were those of a histamine-type reaction. Because abalone
is not one of the species expected to form histamine, substituting limpets for abalone put consumers at risk from a
food that they had not intended to eat. Thus, accurate identification of species is essential to public health protection
and prompt accurate diagnosis and treatment of illness when that protection fails. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Processing practices traditionally used in the seafood industry also are easily abused to increase a product's weight,
in the form of ice or water. For instance, frozen fillets, shrimp, crab legs, and other products are normally protected
from dehydration (freezer burn) while frozen by the application of a light glaze of ice. A packer then includes added
product in the package to compensate for the weight of the glaze. Excessive amounts of glaze, however, not compensated
for in this manner, can deliberately be used to increase the apparent weight, and therefore the apparent value, of
the product delivered. Percentage weight increases from overglazing are most dramatic for foods with high surface
area to volume ratios, such as shrimp. Overglazing is a practice that violates section 402(b)(4) of the act because
a substance has been added to increase a food's weight or to make it appear of greater value than it is. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A similar type of fraud frequently results from oversoaking fish and shellfish meats in dip solutions. Dip solutions
are customarily used to retard the natural loss of moisture (drip loss) from products such as scallops, which are particularly
susceptible to drip loss. However, exposure to the dip may deliberately be prolonged to add weight in the form of water.
Dip solutions may contain chemicals, such as sodium tripolyphosphate, that can greatly enhance the amount of water
absorbed by the scallops. The net effect of such practices is to mislead the consumer into purchasing added water at
scallop prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seafoods generally represent a high dollar value per unit weight compared with other foods, particularly crab, lobster,
shrimp, and certain shellfish. Thus, even relatively modest percentage weight increases from abusive glazing or
water uptake from dip solutions represent a substantial loss of value to the consumer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the same reason, the potential fraudulent profit from similar practices of adding less valuable ingredients,
such as breading on shrimp and fish sticks or water to shucked oysters, to increase the size or weight of products are
enticing to unscrupulous processors.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that economic adulteration occurs with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient frequency in various seafood products to result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial losses to the consumer. Evidence of such economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulteration usually comes to light indirectly, as a result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigations that are carried out for other purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourteen and one-half percent of the samples of seafoods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported in 1986 as having adverse findings by eight FDA district 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
offices were so listed because of product misrepresentation (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
123). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, FDA found that in fiscal years 1991 and 1992, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14.8 and 11.7 percent, respectively, of all consumer complaints 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved complaints of economic problems (Ref. 60). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Imported seafood products also are subject to significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of economic misrepresentation. In 1992, approximately 13 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of all detentions of imported seafood involved some form 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of misbranding, such as false or misleading labeling, short fill, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short weight, standard of identity, and omitted labeling (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
124). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific data on species substitution are available from The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Seafood Inspection Laboratory (NSIL) of NMFS, Department 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Commerce. Data gathered for the 3-year period of 1990&hyph;1992 by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the laboratory in conducting species verification tests requested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by industry show that 59 percent of the samples labeled as cod, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
57 percent of the product labeled as haddock, 56 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product labeled as flounder or sole, and 51 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product labeled as red snapper were not the species claimed on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the label. While these data cannot be regarded as representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of industry-wide misbranding practices because the testing was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not random, the results indicate a remarkably high incidence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species substitution. Moreover, these findings are consistent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with other surveys (Ref. 35, p. 45). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, a survey conducted in Florida to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent of retail species substitution in the case of red snapper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found that 64 percent of the fish fillets labeled for retail sale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as red snapper were misbranded (Ref. 125). The prevalence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misbranding just this one desirable species is underscored by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observation: ``If all of the red snapper sold in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States were genuine, the seas would long since have been swept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absolutely clean of this species'' (Ref. 126, p. 41). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While most States' regulations follow FDA nomenclature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy and regulations, misbranding practices are exacerbated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the failure of some States to require these common names for some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species sold within the State. Red snapper again provides a case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study in the extent of variation in acceptable nomenclature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed for a species. Although not permitted when sold in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interstate commerce, California regulations allow 12 species of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rockfish to be labeled as ``Pacific red snapper'' within the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, Oregon and Washington regulations also allow rockfish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be called ``snapper'' (Ref. 126, p. 305). Moreover, an even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater variety of imported species may be misrepresented as ``red 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
snapper.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many in the seafood industry believe that economic abuse is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one its most significant problems. A survey conducted by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Fisheries Institute found that the Institute's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
membership supported mandatory inspection as a means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overcoming practices that pose a threat to the reputation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and packers adhering to scrupulous practices in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representation of their products (Ref. 127). General agreement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was found to exist among processors, distributors, and importers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as retailers and restaurateurs, that abusive economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices are widespread, including overglazing and overbreading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of fishery products, inaccurate net weight measurement, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitution of inferior species for more valuable fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a similar industry study by the Southeastern Fisheries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association, members ranked problems with economic fraud (such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species identification, overglazing, and the use of phosphates) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above all other seafood industry problems, except vessel handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices (Ref. 128). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Recommended Adoption of HACCP-Based Methods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the agency recognizes that HACCP was developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily to address safety, FDA believes that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement in &sect;123.6, for seafood processors to adopt HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods to ensure the safety of seafoods provides an opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for processors to develop and apply effective control point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures that they can use to ensure that seafoods comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions of sections 402(b) and 403 of the act, The Fair 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Packaging and Labeling Act, the seafood standards of identity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated in 21 CFR, and applicable compliance policy guides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued by the agency (Compliance Policy Guides 7108.01, 7108.03, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7108.04, 7108.12, 7108.13, 7108.14, 7108.21, and 7108.23). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, the agency is proposing in Appendix D to establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a guideline for HACCP-based procedures to avoid economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulteration and misbranding of seafoods. Following this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guideline will enable processors to develop procedures and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records that will establish that they are not engaged in any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices that would render their products economically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulterated. Clearly, however, guidelines cannot prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic fraud. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following guideline for product integrity lists critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control points covering raw material receipt, processing, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labels and labeling that processors and importers can incorporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in their HACCP plans. The agency believes that proper control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
begins with verification of the raw materials received by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor. Therefore, in Appendix D, section 2.a., the agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggesting that, as part of their HACCP plan, processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers should include critical control points beginning with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the receipt of raw materials. Ensuring that raw materials meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limits (e.g., correct species identification, net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight, additive identification) at the point they enter a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor's or importer's control is crucial. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are a number of ways to ensure that species are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly identified. Physical examination, as indicated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix D, section 2.a.1. is the typical method of determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the identity of a species. The agency believes that most seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and importers are knowledgeable about the species that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they handle and would have personnel available at the point of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt who could monitor the incoming shipments for species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substitution. Expert consultation is another option for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correctly identifying species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Processors or importers can also check the identity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood by employing laboratory services, as provided for in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix D, section 2.a.2. Protein chromatography is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory method that can accurately establish the species of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and fishery products (Ref. 50). Another option, Appendix D, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 2.a.3., is to receive raw materials certified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suppliers under either limited or general and continuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guaranties (section 303(c)(2) of the act (21 U.S.C. 333(c)(2)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 21 CFR 7.12 and 7.13). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Appendix D, section 2.b., the agency points out that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors must ensure that the labels, labeling, and invoices of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their finished products accurately list weight, count, size, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product identity, as well as the content of valuable constituents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., that ingredient that the consumer identifies as providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reason to purchase the product, for example, the shrimp in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breaded shrimp). The content of the valuable constituents must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be maintained as required by FDA's standards of identity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations (21 CFR part 161, including: oysters, Pacific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salmon, canned wet packed shrimp in transparent or nontransparent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containers, frozen raw breaded shrimp, frozen raw lightly breaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shrimp, and canned tuna) or in accordance with FDA's compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy guides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More specifically, as in Appendix D, section 2.b.1., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species must be correctly identified by its common or usual name 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and be so represented on the label and labeling. To assist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors and consumers, FDA has developed both printed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
database versions of the ``FDA Fish List'' to provide such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance. Also specific requirements for such labeling are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in Standards of Identity and the Common or Usual Name 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations (21 CFR, parts 161 and 102). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix D, sections 2.b.2. through b.5. are based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 402(b) of the act. Under Appendix D, section 2.b.2., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor needs to ensure that valuable constituents of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product are not omitted or abstracted. For example, breaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shrimp must contain the required weight ratio of shrimp to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breading. Similarly, shrimp must be of the size and/or weight 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified on the label or labeling.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Appendix D, section 2.b.3., the processor needs to

ensure that no substance is substituted wholly or in part for a

Under Appendix D, section 2.b.4., the processor needs to

M. Additional Guidance_FDA Fish and Fishery Products Hazards and Controls Guide Including Specific Guidance on
Smoked Fishery Products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As an adjunct to its rulemaking to require HACCP procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the seafood industry, FDA is drafting an extensive guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for processors to use in understanding and implementing HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles for their operations. This guidance will provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information that processors and importers can use in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of their HACCP plans. This information consists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largely of an identification of hazards that can affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of seafood and a review of control measures that can keep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the hazards from actually occurring, or that can at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize the likelihood of their occurrence. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has included selected portions of the draft HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance as Appendix 1 to this proposal, so as to better inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public about how this guidance will be structured and about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the kinds of assistance that will be available to processors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importers who implement HACCP. The agency emphasizes, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this guidance is a work-in-progress and still being developed by FDA. Nonetheless, the agency seeks comment
on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for this guidance and the usefulness of the format the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency proposes to adopt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA is including in Appendix 1 specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance on time-temperature and salinity parameters and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matters for use in the HACCP plans of processors of smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fishery products. While FDA is seeking comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the guidance generally, it particularly seeks comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance on smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products. Material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relevant to the safe processing of smoked and smoke-flavored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery products is found in various sections of the HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance because this general guidance is primarily organized by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazard rather than by commodity type. However, the agency has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gathered the materials relating to smoked and smoke-flavored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery products into a single section of the guidance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate use of this guidance by this industry, and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate obtaining public comment on it. As stated above, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seeks public comment on the appropriateness of the materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relating to smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance, on their validity as guidelines, and on whether they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be made mandatory by incorporating them into any final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation that results from this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While no known outbreaks of botulism attributed to smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish have been reported since 1963, FDA believes that the failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by manufacturers to obtain information about the composition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hot- and cold-process products represents a potential health hazard. Without analytical results from the testing
for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt and sodium nitrite levels, a manufacturer cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine whether the fish have been adequately processed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhibit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
spore outgrowth and toxin production. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's concerns are underscored by the diversity of processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures and salt levels used in the manufacture of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products, particularly the lower range temperatures and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt levels (Ref. 24). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, as stated above, the use of modified atmosphere and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum packaging with smoked and smoke-flavored fish products is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also a source of concern. These types of packaging provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anaerobic environment in which
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores can grow out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and produce botulin, the causative agent in botulism. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumed, the toxin attacks the central nervous system and may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause death if untreated within 3 to 6 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all these reasons, FDA has tentatively concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some type of guidance that defines the procedures for the safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of smoked and smoke-flavored fish is necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, fish have been smoked in order to preserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them. Today, the primary reason for smoking is to impart certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taste and texture qualities to the fish. There are essentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two types of smoked fish: (1) Those that are subjected to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``cold process'' that leaves the fish soft and moist, with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delicate smoke flavor, such as lox, and (2) those that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subjected to a ``hot process'' that produces a less moist, firmer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product with heavier smoke flavor, such as smoked whitefish.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The processing of these fish basically involves: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cleaning and gutting followed by (2) immersion in a brine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solution or dry salt in order to salt them, (3) drying in a cool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature to avoid bacterial growth, (4) smoking in a smoking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber at a temperature and for a time necessary to achieve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desired ``cold process'' or ``hot process'' effect, and (5) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging and cooling. The taste and texture qualities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to ``cold process'' smoked fish require much lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures during the smoking phase of the process than those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to ``hot process.'' Salted fish may not be smoked at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with virtually all fish, the species used to make smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish are exposed during their lives to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a spore- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forming bacterium that is ubiquitous in the marine and freshwater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. Type E is the predominant type of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in fish, other aquatic animals, water, and sediment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although other types such as A, proteolytic and nonproteolytic B, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C, D, and F also have been found in fish (Refs. 148 through 152). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The concentration of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores that may be expected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and on a naturally contaminated fish is unknown, although it is reported to vary from one spore per 16 g of fish to one
spore per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
200 g (Refs. 153 and 180). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under certain conditions, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can produce a toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that causes botulism, a disease that attacks the central nervous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system of humans and can cause death within 3 to 6 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion if not properly treated (Ref. 193). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum's
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability to form spores means that in a dormant state, it can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survive environments that are otherwise hostile to it. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is ``anaerobic,'' meaning that air constitutes a hostile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. When conditions become favorable, that is, when no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air is present, the spores experience ``outgrowth'' during which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxin can be produced. In fish, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores are found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the intestines and can also adhere to the surface of fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can be found in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment of most any fish processor and cannot be totally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminated using reasonable means. Moreover, even though a fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be cleaned, gutted, and air packaged, some risk will still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores can find their way into muscle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tissue during processing. Muscle tissue below the surface of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish can provide an anaerobic environment where outgrowth and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxin production can occur if time and temperature permit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the processing procedures in Appendix 1 are based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on studies of the time-temperature and salinity conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to prevent the outgrowth of botulinum spores, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices are also effective in the elimination of risk from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other pathogenic bacteria such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes. L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a pathogenic bacterium that is widespread in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment and that is commonly isolated from surface waters and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other environmental samples. Thus the likelihood of finding this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogen on the exterior surfaces and viscera of fish is high. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1983, several large outbreaks of human listeriosis have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been linked to the consumption of contaminated foods (Refs. 130, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
131, and 132), thereby demonstrating the etiologic importance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foodborne transmission of this disease in humans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although listeriosis is a relatively rare illness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(approximately 2,000 reported cases per year in the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States), the exceptionally high mortality rate, as high as 34 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, makes this illness one of the leading fatal foodborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diseases in the United States. The highest incidence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listeriosis generally occurs in neonates, the elderly, pregnant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women, and individuals suffering from compromised immune systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, there are instances in which apparently healthy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals have contracted listeriosis (Refs. 130 and 133). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The incidence of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Listeria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 species (including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in frozen raw and cooked seafood products is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reportedly as high as 61 percent (Ref. 136). Indeed, numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood products have been shown to support growth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Refs. 137 and 138). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is capable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of prolific growth on smoked salmon stored at 4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C, even when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
test inocula as low as 6 organisms per gram (g) are applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the surface of fish samples (Ref. 139). Seafoods other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoked or smoke-flavored fish have been epidemiologically linked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to two outbreaks and one sporadic case of listeriosis (Ref. 140). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, several cooked seafood products have been recalled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the market in North America because of contamination with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

flavored fish products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A recent survey of smoked fish and smoked fish products in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Iceland has shown that 29 percent of samples tested were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Listeria
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 species, including 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 141). Another survey revealed that 8.9 percent and 13.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of hot- and cold-smoked fish, respectively, were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Ref. 142). Cold-smoked fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may pose a significant health risk, particularly when stored for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extended periods. When raw salmon was inoculated with known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 and smoked at 78.8 to 86 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (26 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 30 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 6 hours, and the finished product stored at 39.2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4 and 10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for up to 30 days, investigators observed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial increases in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 populations at both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incubation temperatures (Ref. 143). No known cases of listeriosis have been linked to smoked seafood consumption
in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast, studies have shown that properly controlled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hot-smoking processes effectively eliminate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

contamination (Ref. 144). In raw trout inoculated with high doses of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, stored for 12 hours in a marinade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing 10 percent NaCl, and then subjected to a hot-smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process (dried for 30 minutes at 140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (60 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), cooked at 230 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(110 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) until an internal temperature of 149 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (65 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained for 20 minutes, and finally smoked for 45 minutes at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 did not survive the smoking process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, when fish were inoculated after smoking and stored at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
46.4 to 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (8 to 10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), a significant increase in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 populations was observed after up to 20 days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage. These findings further emphasize the importance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventing the contamination of processed fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Studies have also shown the importance of controlling the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salt concentration in smoked fish. Although 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survive in environments containing up to 20 percent NaCl (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
145), it has been demonstrated that the organism becomes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasingly more sensitive to NaCl when it is exposed to heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing (Ref. 146). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the prevalence of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, it may be impossible to completely eliminate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organism from all foods. However, use of the sanitary practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and processing practices proposed in this document should prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross-contamination and growth of the organism in smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored seafoods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Smoking fish is a delicate process, involving a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interrelated variables including times, temperatures, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to smoke, salt, and sodium nitrite, when used. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that, by its very nature, this process involves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain inherent risks, risks that, if not attended to, can have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very significant consequences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, the times/temperatures involved in the ``hot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process'' can injure but not kill
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
killing spoilage microorganisms. Thus, during the period when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the spoilage microorganisms are becoming reestablished, surviving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores would be presented with an optimum growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment because of the lack of competition. Yet, because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the absence of spoilage microorganisms, spoilage odors that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warn consumers away from potentially dangerous products would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be present. Botulism toxin alone is not detectable by sensory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, because of the number and types of steps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved, the processing of smoked fish involves an unusual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amount of handling of the product relative to other seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing procedures. Increased handling presents increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunities for contamination during the process than would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise be the case.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The finished product also is inherently more risky than most other seafood products because it is a ready-to-eat product
that is generally not cooked before eating. However, the present evidence indicates that smoked fish has caused no
more cases of botulism in the United States than any other type of seafood product. In contrast, fresh fillets that
are not smoked are intended to be cooked before consumption. Cooking is lethal to bacteria and will deactivate botulism
toxin. Thus, smoked fish products usually do not get the benefit of an additional processing step that protects against
most bacteriological risks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these inherent characteristics, FDA believes that smoked fish present special risks because both
domestic and foreign processors are now using vacuum packaging to a substantial extent_much more so than are other
segments of the seafood industry. A 1988&hyph;1989 FDA and New York State survey of domestic processing plants, for
example, showed that 45 percent of the firms visited vacuum-packaged smoked fish. However, there is no evidence to
show a linkage between vacuum packaging of smoked fish and illness in the 5 years since this survey was completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An economic incentive for use of vacuum packaging is the extended shelf-life of the product, made possible by the anaerobic
environment in the package that prevents the growth of some spoilage microorganisms and slows the growth of others.
Because this anaerobic environment cannot prevent spoilage altogether, vacuum-packaged products must still be
refrigerated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unfortunately, the anaerobic environment greatly favors the outgrowth of any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spores that may be present over the development of telltale spoilage microorganisms. Thus, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 outgrowth can occur before spoilage if a vacuum-packaged product is temperature abused, i.e., not refrigerated.
Moreover, as discussed elsewhere in this document, the growth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 type E and nonproteolytic type B is possible even at refrigeration temperatures below 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C). FDA believes that strict controls are needed to overcome this risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1970, FDA issued a final rule for smoked fish in response to outbreaks of botulism attributed to vacuum-packaged
smoked fish products (35 FR 17401, November 13, 1970). Among other things, the rule attempted to control the risk of
botulism by setting conservative processing parameters for time, temperature, and salinity that would minimize
the opportunity for 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spore outgrowth. These parameters were based on the relatively limited research that had been conducted up to that
time with one species of fish. Many processors claimed that these parameters would have resulted in a product that
was too salty and too dry in texture to be marketable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule was overturned in court due to procedural problems (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Nova Scotia Food Products Corp.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 568 F.2d 240 (2d Cir. 1977)). However, in rethinking this rule after the remand, FDA decided that research was needed
into the relationships among time, temperature, and salinity to develop processing parameters that would provide
safety without producing an undesirable product that consumers would not buy.

this research.

1. Need for Guidance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA routinely inspects smoked fish processing establishments for sanitary conditions using the guidance in 21 CFR
part 110, ``Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packing, or Holding Human Food'' (Ref. 196) and
in the FDA Inspection Operations Manual, Chapter 5, Establishment Inspection and section 616.6 Smoked Fish inspection
methods (Ref. 197). In addition to the Establishment Inspection Reports (EIR's) discussed in section G, EIR's for
smoked fish processing establishments over the past few years (1985 to the present) show evidence that the use of manufacturing
procedures are not in line with CGMP's. The EIR's also show that processing parameters and controlled processing
and storage techniques, commonly recognized as appropriate in the industry (Ref. 182) are not being used (Ref. 169).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Typical observations by FDA officials in these inspections include: (1) Live flies in production areas providing
a vehicle for contamination and recontamination of products; (2) standing water in production rooms providing a
medium for microbial growth and contamination from splashed water; (3) utensils not sanitized prior to use; (4) open
bags of raw materials in storage areas exposing products to flying insects and potential microbial contamination;
(5) smoke racks encrusted with pieces of fish from previous processes, thus providing an opportunity for microbial
growth; (6) refrigerators being used for both raw and finished products, thus providing an environment for microbial
growth through cross-contamination between unprocessed and processed products; (7) overcrowded fish in brine
tanks, whereby some fish are not fully submerged in brine, resulting in lower and uneven levels of salt uptake that
would not be effective in inhibiting spore outgrowth; (8) salinity and microbiologic testing not performed on products;
(9) low minimum water-phase salt levels (0.88 to 1.79 percent) that would not inhibit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spore outgrowth and toxin production; and (10) poor employee practices that foster microbial contamination, including
spitting into sinks adjacent to sinks used to thaw product, not washing or sanitizing hands, and street clothes in
contact with product (Ref. 169). (See also Ref. 200.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of its Fiscal Year (FY) 91 Domestic Fish and Fishery Products Inspection Assignment, FDA conducted food safety
inspections of smoked fish establishments. These inspections revealed a continuing pattern of problems in these
facilities. In over half of these inspections FDA found violations that required action, ranging from minor violations,
which are normally handled by informing the firm's official during the inspection, to more serious violations that
prompted some form of official agency action (Ref. 200).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, several States, working through AFDO, have expressed concern that a potential health hazard exists
with smoked and smoke-flavored fish products and have stated that a Federal regulation is necessary for uniform regulation
of the production and distribution of these foods (Refs. 170 and 189). AFDO is an organization of Federal, State, and
local regulatory officials with membership representing all 50 states, as well as FDA and other Federal agencies.
AFDO's Central States Regional organization held a meeting in 1988, attended by public health officials from 6 states
in which the smoked fish industry is concentrated, Canada, and NMFS, to discuss a Federal regulation governing the
processing, storage, and distribution of smoked and smoke-flavored fish products. In December, 1989, AFDO first
passed a resolution requesting that FDA expedite the rulemaking process to establish uniform Federal regulations
to ensure that safe smoked fish processing methods are utilized for fish products sold in the United States. In December,
1990, AFDO passed resolution 8, which strongly encouraged FDA to ``accelerate the promulgation of smoked fish CGMP's
so that concerned States can move forward with their efforts to ensure the safety of smoked fish'' (Ref. 170). FDA recognizes
the need to address the hazards associated with smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products and therefore is setting
forth the procedures in Appendix 1 in the interest of protecting the public health.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The need for some type of agency guidance on smoked fish is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also evidenced by several other factors. First, the 1970 final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, which covered only hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish and the processing parameters that they required,
is still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being used as a guideline by some States. These earlier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters could result in commercially undesirable products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These parameters ought to be updated with the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technological understanding and processing flexibility for both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hot and cold smoked products. The guidance in this document can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the basis on which such updating can occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the manufacture or sale of cold-processed fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products is not permitted in at least two States because there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are no regulations or regulatory guidelines for these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 170). There is some pressure, however, to permit the sale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these products. The Canadian Government, for example, has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
urged these States, Minnesota and Michigan, to permit the sale of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products so that Canadian products may be exported to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States (Ref. 170). Some type of guidance that helps to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define the processing parameters and techniques that reduce human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health risks from cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products would provide State, as well as federal, public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
officials with the tools necessary to evaluate the safety of cold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed products manufactured in the United States, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those imported into the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, in 1988 FDA conducted a survey of processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters used by fish smoking plants in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventy five percent of the firms surveyed did not do final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product testing to ascertain whether their products met commonly recognized (Ref. 182) parameters for their products
(Ref. 24). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information collected in this survey augmented information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained from the New York State Department of Agriculture and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marketing (Ref. 24), which had conducted a similar survey of fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking establishments in that State at approximately the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time. A total of 64 establishments were surveyed by FDA and New 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
York State, representing over 90 percent of the smoked fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers in the United States. Among the species of fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the survey were chubs, bluefish, trout, carp, salmon, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whitefish, and herring. Processing information was collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from manufacturers, and samples were collected for laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ranged from 0.88 to 27.5 percent and in cold-process products

from 1.33 to 18.1 percent. Twenty-eight firms (43.7 percent) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum packed cold-process products, but 60.7 percent of those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms did not test final products for water-phase salt content or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for residual sodium nitrite. Twenty-five firms (39.1 percent) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum packed hot-process products, but 68 percent of those firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did not test final products for water-phase salt content or for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residual sodium nitrite. Seventy-five percent of the firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveyed did not test final products for water-phase salt content 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or for residual sodium nitrite, where used. Since this survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was conducted, the frequency of FDA inspections of smoked fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishments has been increased over 50 percent each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA is providing guidance on the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters for processing smoked fishery products in Appendix 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The guidance addresses critical control points that apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products as a class and that will typically be identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the HACCP plans of most processors of smoke and smoke-flavored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. The guidance also addresses ways of controlling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards at these critical control points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The key processing parameters that must be controlled to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure the safety of these products involve time, temperature, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and salinity. While a range of time-temperature-salinity (TTS) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values will provide a safe product, there are now known safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimums for these values that have been developed through years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of research. Processors whose TTS values fall below these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimums do not produce a safe product and shift much of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden of preventing botulism toxin outgrowth to those who take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possession of these products after they leave the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant, including the ultimate consumer. This burden includes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among other things, maintaining strict temperature control at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F or lower even though it is known that many commercial and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home refrigerators are unable to maintain this temperature (Ref. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
201). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These TTS minimums are known to produce a marketable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, because there are processors that operate in conformance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with them. Moreover, because they are minimums, these values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow for the production of a variety of products, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different types of lox with varying amounts of saltiness, to suit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different tastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These minimum TTS values provide the only scientifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valid way developed to date of ensuring that no botulism toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be produced over the shelf life of the product under proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration conditions or under conditions of moderate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature abuse. The minimum values, coupled with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation practices proposed in this document, should also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure against the presence of detectable 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These minimum TTS values are being issued at this time as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed guidance to ensure maximum flexibility. If these values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are reflected in the HACCP plans that are required by proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A of 21 CFR part 123, and are being effectively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented by the processor, the agency is likely to find that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plan and its implementation are adequate with regard to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limits and critical control points. The same holds true 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the other types of controls recommended in the guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is requesting comment on this approach, and on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following alternatives: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Issue all or part of the materials relating to smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoke-flavored fishery products in Appendix 1 as regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than guidance. Given the public health concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with these products and the scientific basis for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TTS minimums, it may well be appropriate to issue them as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. Such regulations would take into account advances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in knowledge and technology by allowing processors to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative processing parameters so long as these alternatives were scientifically demonstrated to produce an
equivalent level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of safety. (Section 11 of the guidance relating to smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fishery products in Appendix 1 contains such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feature.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Issue a performance standard as a regulation, while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaving the materials in Appendix 1 as guidelines on how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors could meet the performance standard. The likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance standard would be, as suggested above (and included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 11 of the guidance relating to smoked and smoke- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavored fishery products in Appendix 1): (a) for botulism, zero 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxin production in the product during a time period through_and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slightly beyond_the shelf life of the product, demonstrated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through inoculated pack studies under normal and moderate abuse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions; and (b) no detectable L. monocytogenes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Maintain the guidance relating to smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products in the FDA Fish and Fishery Products

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hazards and Controls Guide and control safety through the HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for all seafood in proposed subpart A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA requests comment on which of these alternatives is most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to ensure that smoked fish will be safe and is most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the agency's obligations under the act. In the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of a regulation or guideline, how can the agency best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the results of the research that it has conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be available for use by the industry? FDA solicits comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on these and the matters raised above.

N. Verification Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As described in section IV.A. of this document, one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NACMCF's seven HACCP principles involves verification that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP system is working. NACMCF recommends that HACCP plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include procedures for verification of the HACCP system (Ref. 34, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
p. 200). FDA advises processors to consider adopting this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendation, but has not proposed to require it because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency expects verification to occur through: (1) A firm's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistency with the controls and limits to be provided by FDA in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HACCP guidance described in section VII.C. and M. of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document; (2) third-party technical assistance provided through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade associations, universities and government agencies; and (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review of all HACCP monitoring records by trained individuals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before distribution of product (see proposed &sect;123.8(b)); the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed corrective action requirements (see proposed &sect;123.7), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially the provision for assessment of HACCP plans as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consequence of deviations (&sect;123.7(a)(4)); the recommended use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process authorities for cooked, ready-to-eat products (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix A); the proposed general training requirements (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.9); and inspector review during routine agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspections. FDA invites comment on whether this approach is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate to ensure that the NACMCF verification principle is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being properly addressed, both for individual firms and for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall HACCP program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For individual firms, NACMCF specifically discourages the sole reliance on end-product sampling for verification
purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 34, p. 201). FDA also has questions concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficacy of end-product sampling as the only way to measure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
success of HACCP. These caveats notwithstanding, FDA invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on what tests should be used to measure success, both in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of individual firms and the program as a whole, and how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently such tests should be administered.

VIII. Other Approaches to HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This preamble has described in great detail the HACCP system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is being proposed and the reasoning behind each proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision. While the agency is inviting comment on the merits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each provision, FDA also invites comment on the overall system, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including whether some other approach to HACCP or some variation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed approach might be preferable. Variations on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed approach include, but are not limited to: (1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring HACCP only for higher risk seafood products; (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exempting small firms from HACCP requirements; (3) staggering the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date for implementation based on size of firm or risk; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (4) deleting or altering some of the requirements in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal in order to facilitate implementation and lower costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A brief discussion of each of these variations follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Higher Risk Only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An alternative to requiring HACCP for all commercial seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products would be to require it for products or processes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been linked to significant numbers reported seafood-borne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses. As section II.B. of this document explains in detail, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many of the reported illnesses from seafood involve raw molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish and certain species of finfish that can accumulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scombrotoxin and ciguatoxin. Other seafood products cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illness but are not as commonly reported. FDA invites comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether this proposed regulation should apply only to molluscan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shellfish and the species responsible for scombrotoxin and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ciguatoxin poisonings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A variation on this approach would be to have the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation apply to those species and processes with a higher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential for harm, even if actual illnesses from them cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented from the foodborne illness reporting system. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described earlier in the preamble, the fact that the system is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not recording illnesses from a particular food does not mean that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses are not occurring. Also, potential for harm need not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always be measured in terms of the number of illnesses that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actually occurring. For example, some problems, like botulism, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may occur infrequently, but when they do, the consequences can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devastating. Based on the potential for harm, other candidates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for inclusion would be: (1) Hot-process smoked and hot-process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish, cold-process smoked and cold-process smoke- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavored fish, because of the hazards of botulism and listeria; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) cooked, ready-to-eat products, because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological hazards associated with products that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended to be cooked by the consumer; (3) low acid canned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foods, because of the hazard of botulism and general complexity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the processing operation; (4) raw, ready-to-eat products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the risk of parasites; and (5) species that require a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgment as to appropriate location of harvest to avoid unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pesticide or industrial contaminant levels.

FDA also invites comment on the effect of using a modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach on the regulation of imports, especially with regard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the types of products described in item (5) above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Exempting Small Firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA invites comment on whether small firms should be exempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the proposed regulation. Even if exempted, these firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would still be subject to the requirements of current food safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law and to inspection by FDA and State authorities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier in this preamble, small operations are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
norm in the seafood industry. A significant majority of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors have total revenues of under 1 million dollars. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small firms are to be exempted, FDA invites comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria that should be used for exempting them, including how a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small firm should be defined for purposes of an exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation of HACCP may be more burdensome for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms than for large firms. Large firms tend to have quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control personnel already in place. In addition, many regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are less burdensome for a large firm in proportion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to output than they are for a small firm. On the other hand, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is taking steps, such as the preparation of its HACCP guidance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to minimize the cost of these regulations for small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, such an exemption may not be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also points out that, because many large firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already have quality control systems, an exemption for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business would appear to result in requiring HACCP for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
segment of the industry (i.e., large firms) that needs it the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least. Large processors, moreover, tend to process relatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low risk products, such as breaded fish and shrimp and raw fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
blocks. Many high-risk processors, such as processors of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked, ready-to-eat products, tend to be small, and processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of raw molluscan shellfish tend to be very small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonetheless, an exemption for small business could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to those small businesses that produce low risk products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and FDA invites comment on this approach. As stated earlier, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, the criteria for determining low as well as high risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not clear, due largely to the limitations of the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foodborne illness reporting system. Moreover, a case can be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that risk also relates to the margin for error in a processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation and to the consequences of failure as well as to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual occurrence of illness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With these points in mind, FDA invites comment on how to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define ``low risk.'' FDA also invites comment on what the nature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the exemption should be. Should a firm be exempt from all or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of the HACCP requirements? As circumstances change, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP-based analysis of risk by a firm might reveal that the firm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has become a high risk processor rather than a low risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor. In addition, FDA invites comment on whether such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption should be obtained by petitioning the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, even if an exemption were to be adopted in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule based on the comments received, the agency would still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage voluntary adoption of HACCP systems by exempted firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The advantages that HACCP is expected to provide in terms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer confidence, control of process, and access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
international markets warrant adoption of this system.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA also invites comment on the effect of a small business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption on the regulation of imports. How would HACCP be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to imports under a tiered approach? Would it be possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to treat domestic and imported products equally under such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Staggered Phase-in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations include an effective date of 1 year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the publication of a final rule. FDA has explained the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasoning behind this proposed effective date and has invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on it elsewhere in this preamble. In addition, comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are invited on the merits of a staggered phase-in instead of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single implementation date for all affected entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two most obvious ways of accomplishing a staggered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phase-in would be to differentiate on the basis of size or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis of risk. Differentiating on the basis of size would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presumably allow small businesses to have a longer time or times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for implementation than would be allowed for larger firms. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested earlier, large firms are probably much more able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement a HACCP system than are small firms. Theoretically, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the longer lead time for small firms would allow the private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector to develop an infrastructure that could help small firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement HACCP. Such an infrastructure could include process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorities (see the preamble discussion on cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products), testing facilities, and consulting services from trade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations, academia, and others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an additional consideration, FDA will likely learn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lessons from its experiences in implementing the regulation that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it could apply to the benefit of those that would have to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement it at a later date. For example, FDA is considering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether it should make the first review of HACCP plans by agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigators a nonregulatory evaluation to facilitate plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development by the processor (although the overall inspection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plant would be regulatory). The agency invites comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this approach. Presumably, the more experience the agency has, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the better this evaluation will be. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, as noted above, small firms are involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the processing of higher risk products. How does this fact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bear on the possibility of longer implementation times for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Differentiation solely on the basis of risk appears to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more complex than differentiation on the basis of size. If high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk products were to be phased in first, it would appear that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those with the most complex plans to develop and implement would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive the shortest lead time, while those with the simplest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans would receive the longest lead time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the criteria for determining risk would have to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carefully considered. FDA asks for comment on whether a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staggered start should begin with raw molluscan shellfish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain species of finfish that can accumulate scombrotoxin and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ciguatoxin, or whether other criteria should apply, as discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA invites comment on all these matters. FDA also invites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on the effect of a phase-in approach on the regulation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imports. How could this approach be applied to imported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Deleting or Modifying Aspects of This Proposal, or Taking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some Other Step, to Reduce the Burden of Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As has already been explained in this preamble, FDA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed only the basics of HACCP in order to keep the regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden to a minimum. Several features of HACCP included within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NACMCF's seven principles, such as flow charts and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishment of ``HACCP teams,'' are noted in this preamble, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has not proposed to require them. Nonetheless, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledges that, theoretically, there are a number of ways in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which this proposal could be scaled back even further. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comments on whether such scaling back would be desirable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, if so, how it could be done. Possible areas for scale-back 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include, but are not limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Requiring only negative, rather than positive records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Negative records note only deviations from critical limits and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how they are corrected. If a critical control point is under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control, no record is made. Admittedly, FDA has reservations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about such an approach. For example, it is virtually impossible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for firms or for FDA to spot trends that could lead to problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if only negative records are being kept. Nonetheless, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comment on this approach.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Developing generic plans by FDA that list critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control points and contain other information for various industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
segments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Deleting some or all of the proposed specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitation requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Requiring HACCP only for the domestic industry. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP requirements would become the basis for negotiating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements with other countries relating to the equivalency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Deleting or modifying the proposed training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Requiring HACCP for processing hazards only. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Canadian HACCP system does not involve species-related safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Exempting warehouses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Although only in guidelines (Appendix B, Scombroid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toxin-Forming Species), sanctioning the receipt by a processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a harvester of an assurance of good handling practices, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than detailed time/temperature records. Such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance, without further verification, would be acceptable only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from harvesters with histories of delivering acceptable products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These four alternative approaches to implementing these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Comments are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invited on them in combination as well as on them individually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Information and Consumer Awareness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to requesting comment on alternative approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to HACCP, FDA is taking the opportunity to invite comment on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general subject of complementary risk reduction activities, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily directed toward postprocessing handling. Elsewhere in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this document, FDA invited comment on the advisability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying HACCP or alternative regulatory approaches to commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities that are not directly subject to these proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, i.e., harvesting vessels, common carriers, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail establishments (although not necessarily doing so as part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this rulemaking). In addition, FDA seeks comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate education and information that should be directed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toward consumers and recreational fishermen. The commercial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of HACCP principles can mitigate somewhat the effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of poor consumer handling practices by helping to ensure that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe product reaches the home, but no such program can prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses caused by improper home handling. Similarly, HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practiced by processors can have no effect on recreational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishermen who consume their own catch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Education has always been an important part of FDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive seafood safety program, but the agency believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that more can be done. Recent FDA education projects include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initiation of a seafood hotline, which has been consulted by over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26,000 individuals on a wide range of seafood safety issues since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it began in October 1992. (The hotline can be reached by calling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toll-free, 1&hyph;800&hyph;FDA&hyph;4010.) FDA also recently developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brochures aimed at advising certain medically compromised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations that they should not eat molluscan shellfish without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate cooking. FDA invites comment on other types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education and information activities that might be useful, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including more information that might be made available through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grocery stores, pharmacies, and other establishments, through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
media, and through other means, including labeling. FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering the merits of labeling information for consumers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molluscan shellfish, and will address this issue in proceedings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
separate from these regulations. FDA notes that several states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have already mandated, or are in the process of mandating, point- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of-purchase information for raw molluscan shellfish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency also invites comment on whether FDA should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider proposing to require handling instructions for consumers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the labeling of seafood. The Department of Agriculture has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed such requirements for meat and poultry (58 FR 58922, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 4, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has a longstanding program to control the levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms of public health concern in seafood. This program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes compliance policies on such levels, including zero 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels (i.e., none detectable based upon official methods) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such pathogens as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Listeria monocytogenes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in cooked, ready-to-eat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in all foods. These proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require control of microbial pathogens through HACCP principles, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including specific sanitation controls. Even so, FDA recognizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no system can reduce all risks to zero. Because all foods 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the home, including seafood, are subject to mishandling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cross contamination from other sources, FDA invites comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the general subject of handling instructions. Should FDA decide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to propose handling instructions, it would do so as a regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal separate from the proposed HACCP requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The information requirements in this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule are essentially monitoring and recordkeeping requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encompassing critical control points in the production and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection of fish and fishery products as established in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plans of processors and importers. The specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information collected and the frequency of collection will depend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on such factors as the species and the processing conditions. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will include observations of processing parameters such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time and temperature of processing and storage; the condition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw materials; the results of chemical and microbiological tests; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sanitation conditions in a processing facility; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective actions taken in response to processing deviations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
etc. Records identifying production lot codes and date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture will also be maintained. Records will be maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the processing facility or at an importer's place of business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 1 year after the date of preparation in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated products and at least 2 years for frozen products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information will be used by FDA investigators during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regularly scheduled inspections of processing plants, or at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time of entry of imports, to determine whether products were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed under sanitary conditions and processed, packaged, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored, and distributed using HACCP control techniques to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards that might cause the products to be adulterated. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information will also be used when necessary to trace and remove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially hazardous products from the marketplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Records of processing conditions will also provide a means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for processors to monitor the quality of their products and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alert them when a deviation from the critical limits established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the HACCP plan has occurred that may create a potential public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health hazard in the final product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The figures provided below reflect an FDA estimate of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual hours of monitoring and recordkeeping based upon currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available data and assumptions about the effects of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements in proposed part 123. The estimate is based on data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to develop cost estimates for the economic impact analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by Executive Order 12866 and thus is subject to the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
types of uncertainties described elsewhere in this preamble. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, the agency has anecdotal evidence that the burden on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms that are operating under a mandatory HACCP system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the State of Alaska is more nominal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, FDA acknowledges the possibility that the estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided here are conservatively high, indicating recordkeeping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdens that are higher than would customarily be the case. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically invites comments on this point.

X. Economic Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 compels agencies to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost-benefit analysis as a component of decisionmaking. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act requires regulatory relief for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
businesses where feasible. FDA finds that this proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutes a major rule under both Executive Order 12866 and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act. A summary of the preliminary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory impact analysis (PRIA), which may be obtained from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dockets Management Branch (address above), is presented below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12866 requires Federal agencies to justify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need for regulations by demonstrating that the problem that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulation is designed to remedy cannot be adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed by measures other than Federal regulation. In its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review of such alternatives, FDA finds that the current system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(periodic inspection plus sampling of a small proportion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood), coupled with the uncertainty in estimating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illnesses related to seafood, has not adequately ensured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers that a minimum level of safety has been established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the tort system is not able to provide remedies for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unsafe seafood, the price system provides some differentiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between products based on brands and retail reputation. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the price system works in conjunction with current Federal regulation which signals consumers as to a minimum level
of seafood safety. As is argued in the preamble, countless public arguments and attempts at legislation imply that
the minimum levels that some consumers believe they are getting (those that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do not search for higher levels) is probably higher than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual levels of seafood safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tort system fails because consumers are often unable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trace either the source of their foodborne illness to seafood, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and even where that is possible, it is often difficult to trace 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood to a specific company.

A. Regulatory Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
FDA has evaluated multiple options to address the compelling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public interest in further ensuring seafood safety. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options include: (1) Maintaining the existing approach_``snapshot'' inspections and sampling; (2) significantly

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing the frequency of both snapshot inspections and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sampling under the existing approach; (3) beginning a voluntary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP program in addition to the existing approach; (4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning mandatory HACCP for high risk products only, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to the existing approach; (5) beginning mandatory HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all seafood (the proposed approach); (6) beginning a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive mandatory HACCP program than that proposed, similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Model Seafood Surveillance Project (MSSP), which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include all CGMP's, quality factors, and economic fraud as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points; and (7) beginning a mandatory water-to-table HACCP program which would include all vessels,
carriers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and retail food operators.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The existing approach does not adequately address the compelling public interest in further ensuring seafood safety
because sampling the large volume of seafood with FDA's limited resources cannot detect many violative products.
Increasing the frequency of sampling and inspections is also unlikely to resolve this problem without significant
increases in funding. These options are discussed extensively in the preamble to the proposed regulations and in
the PRIA. The third option, voluntary HACCP, has been in existence at NOAA and has very few participants. The forth
option, risk-based HACCP, has been evaluated in the PRIA in several forms, including HACCP only for the highest risk
products from a historical perspective and HACCP only for those products with the potential for catastrophic risk.
For example, one possibility evaluated under this option would be to implement HACCP solely for molluscan shellfish,
which NAS and other groups have concluded constitute most of the risk from seafood. The sixth option is more costly
than the proposed option and includes more reliance on CGMP's. Finally, the last option involves mandatory HACCP
for nearly 1 million establishments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The options evaluated in the PRIA have both lower and higher costs than the proposed option. However, the benefits
of all options are not equal to the proposed option. FDA has quantified net benefits of some of the high risk options
and has found them to have been positive net benefits for those costs and benefits which have been quantified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These options are not all equal in terms of costs and benefits. They differ significantly from one another in this regard,
as well as from the option that FDA has selected to propose as new part 123. They are also not equal in their ability to
meet all the regulatory objectives stated in the preamble, including effective treatment of imports and an appropriate
alignment of industry and government responsibilities. FDA seeks comment on the costs and benefits as well as on the
general pros and cons of all the stated options and on any options that the agency may have overlooked. It is extremely
important that FDA's evaluation of regulatory options be as thorough as possible for purposes of developing a final
rule, and that the agency be able to fully articulate the distinctions among them and the significance of those distinctions.

B. Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
There is no single source of data that FDA has found to be entirely satisfactory for developing a preliminary estimate
of the costs of the proposed regulations. Consequently, FDA has considered two sources of information, each with
its own strengths and weaknesses. The results provide a range of possibilities, and FDA invites comment on them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first source is U.S. seafood processors that have actually implemented HACCP systems. The number of such firms
may exceed 100. Understandably, many firms are reluctant to make public detailed information about the costs of operation;
consequently, the information available to FDA from this source is incomplete. On the other hand, there is enough
information from which some preliminary conclusions can be drawn that are relevant to an economic assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second source is a study of the costs of implementing a form of HACCP that was developed by the Department of Commerce
for the congressionally mandated MSSP. That study was performed by an independent contractor for the National Fisheries
Education and Research Foundation, Inc., and commissioned under a grant from NMFS. While these data are the most detailed
available, fitting them to the proposed regulations required extensive adjustments and extrapolations. Thus,
these data also fail to eliminate the considerable uncertainty of the results as they relate to these proposed regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
1. Costs: Actual Industry Experience
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
FDA has some information relevant to the actual costs of implementing HACCP experienced by a number of seafood firms.
While this information is neither detailed nor complete enough to definitively answer the question of how much the
proposed regulations will cost the industry, it does provide insight into the costs of the proposed regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information includes responses to a 1991 evaluation questionnaire from four of the eight firms that participated
in the FDA/NOAA seafood HACCP pilot in 1990&hyph;1991 (Ref. 40). It also includes information more recently provided
to FDA from seven firms through the assistance of NFPA, and from two trade associations. The trade associations, the
NFI and the New England Fisheries Development Association (NEFDA) provided FDA with summary information about member
firms that were implementing HACCP systems. NEFDA has operated a HACCP pilot with member firms through a Federal grant.
The two trade associations provided information on 16 firms. The seven firms that provided information about themselves
through NFPA operate a total of 44 processing plants, so FDA has information on at least 64 plants (Ref. 129).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The firms represent a good cross section of processing operation types, including canned, fresh, frozen, smoked/salted,
and cooked, ready-to-eat products as well as molluscan shellfish. The majority of firms were involved in HACCP as
participants in either pilot programs, the NOAA fee-for-service program, or the State of Alaska program, and therefore
have been subject to some form of third party verification of their HACCP systems. Virtually all of them developed
HACCP plans, and the majority of these included critical control points for quality or economic fraud or both in addition
to safety. In this respect, the majority of firms implemented a more extensive form of HACCP than is being proposed
by FDA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Presumably, start-up costs for HACCP are normally higher than operating costs in subsequent years. The majority
of firms that could estimate their own start-up costs indicated costs in the $1,000 to $5,000 range. The remaining
minority appear to be roughly equally divided between lower and higher costs. A few firms indicated costs in the $20,000
or higher range. These may be firms that decided to hire additional personnel in order to install or implement HACCP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that the cost figures that come from firms that operate more than one plant are for the total costs
of their plants collectively; in order to calculate the average start-up cost per plant for these firms, their costs
would have to be divided by the number of plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nearly twice as many firms did not hire additional personnel or did not anticipate hiring additional personnel as
a result of operating HACCP systems as those who did or felt the need to do so. The overwhelming majority of firms reported
that they believed that the advantages they derived from HACCP were worth the costs to them in terms of better control
over their operations, better sanitation, and greater efficiencies, such as reduced waste. Virtually all foresaw
long-term benefits from operating under HACCP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA notes that there are several uncertainties with this data. The first is that FDA does not know the extent of previous
HACCP-type activities in these firms so that they may have different incremental costs than the industry average.
In addition, these firms may have been relatively larger firms so that they may not be fully representative of the industry.
Also, FDA does not know whether or not these firms would necessarily be in full compliance with the proposed regulations
so that additional costs might have to be expended.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
2. Costs: MSSP Study
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The MSSP study provides FDA with survey data from which detailed cost estimates have been made in the PRIA, subject
to numerous uncertainties. As this is the largest and only randomly selected data base available to FDA, the PRIA relied
primarily on estimates based on these data. The contractor in the MSSP study sent teams into 130 processing plants,
none of which were operating under HACCP systems, to project the costs to each plant to implement and operate a form
of HACCP chosen for that study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In areas where FDA had better data than that used in the contractor reports, the agency has used information available
from its field surveys on current practices or conditions in the industry in general, and it has substituted that information
for the information gathered from the sample plants in the contractor reports. Where gaps in the contractor estimates
exist that could not be filled in by information from FDA field surveys, a number of assumptions have been made for the
purposes of this economic assessment. FDA views the cost estimates extrapolated from the contractor reports and
other sources as preliminary and requests comments on them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From FDA's 1992 official establishment inventory, FDA has estimated that there are 4,846 domestic seafood manufacturing
plants that will be affected by the proposed rule. Thirty-three percent of the first year costs can be attributed to
expenditures necessary to comply with the HACCP-based sanitation provisions of the proposed rule. Another 36 percent
are attributable to monitoring and recordkeeping requirements. In addition, approximately 31 percent of the first
year costs are for equipment such as temperature indicators, temperature recorders, and can seam tear-down machines.
Additional costs are for HACCP training, consulting by processing authorities, writing HACCP plans, instituting
operational changes, responding to critical limit deviations, and analytical testing. The average expected cost
of the proposed rule per domestic manufacturing plant is estimated to be $23,900 in the first year ($24,000 for small
plants, $23,400 for large plants) and $15,000 in the following years ($14,700 for small plants and $15,700 for large
plants). Total costs of the proposed rule for domestic manufacturers are estimated to be $117 million in the first
year and $65 million in the following years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA estimates that 924 importers will bear start-up costs of approximately $8 million, and 1,571 repackers
and warehouses will bear annual recurring costs of $14 million. Therefore, based on these data, FDA estimates domestic
costs for this rule to be $139 million in the first year and $79 million in succeeding years. Discounted domestic costs
are estimated to be $676 million over 10 years (6 percent). FDA also estimates that 8,125 foreign processors will have
initial costs of $96 million and recurring costs of $44 million.

Should smoked fish products be required to bear refrigeration statements on their labels, the maximum possible cost
to this industry segment would be estimated to be $2.5 million for a label redesign for all products. A label redesign
would be likely only in the case of extensive refrigeration instructions. If a simple statement such as ``keep refrigerated''
were to be required, then the cost to the smoked fish industry would be approximately $168,000 because approximately
75 percent of the products currently bear such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These estimates are considerably higher than the estimates from data submitted to FDA from seafood plants as discussed
above. These differences may be attributable to several factors. For example, the MSSP-based estimates also include
estimated costs of compliance by processors with pre-existing sanitation requirements in part 110 and costs of complying
with guidelines that are appended to these proposed regulations. Although these costs are not inherent to the operation
of a HACCP system, they represent one-third of the total MSSP-based estimates. As indicated earlier in this document,
compliance with CGMP's for sanitation has been a continuing problem across the industry. For this reason, FDA is proposing
specific sanitation requirements in subpart A of part 123.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the estimate of costs associated with complying with guidelines in the appendices may be overstated because,
in actuality, FDA may find industry practices other than those stated in the guidelines to be acceptable. The guidelines
are intended to provide the industry with information on how it could implement HACCP, not how it must do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Costs to importers and to foreign processors that ship to the United States were also estimated. In the absence of reliable
data for estimating costs to foreign processors, FDA estimated the number of plants that export seafood to the United
States and based their costs of implementing HACCP on MSSP- generated data on the costs to U.S. plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to recognize that many of the United States major seafood trading partners are using, or have opted
for, HACCP programs. For example, the EC will soon require HACCP or an equivalent system from over 100 nations that
export to it. Consequently, with the current trend toward HACCP worldwide, the costs to many foreign processors of
implementing HACCP may be incurred regardless of whether FDA issued these proposed regulations. Moreover, in the
near future, U.S. importers subject to this proposed rule should have little difficulty finding products produced
under HACCP. FDA specifically invites comment on the estimated costs of the proposed regulations to importers and
foreign processors, e.g., whether they are high due to the worldwide move toward HACCP or whether they are low due to
other factors that have not been considered, and the potential effect on U.S. consumers of requiring that imports
be produced under HACCP systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PRIA presumes that most of the cost of compliance of the proposed regulations will be passed on to consumers. Estimating
the magnitude of these price increases is difficult. U.S. consumers spent about $16.5 billion on domestically produced
seafood in 1991 (Ref. 42). If the domestic industry passed on all of the estimated annual costs to consumers, prices
for domestically produced seafood would increase by less than 1 percent in the first year and less than one-half of
1 percent in succeeding years. Price changes of such magnitude are unlikely to have a major impact on general seafood
purchases. However, some regional price increases may considerably exceed this. In addition, this estimation of
change in price does not address potential concentration effects. It is worth noting that the contractor that performed
the MSSP study estimated a range of cost increases from negligible to 1.3 percent, depending on the type of product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The effect on prices of imported products is impossible to estimate. While the PRIA uses MSSP data and a number of assumptions
to estimate possible costs to foreign processors of complying with the proposed regulations, those costs will be
spread among the consumers from all nations to which these processors export. FDA is unable to estimate what percentage
of these costs would be passed on to U.S. consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other side of the ledger, the MSSP-based estimates were not able to include costs associated with some features
of the proposed rules because data were lacking. An inventory of these features is provided in the PRIA, and FDA invites
comment on possible costs associated with them. They include prevention of cross contamination by the separation
of food contact surfaces, storage at 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F of cooked, ready-to-eat products and products that are made in whole or in part of scombroid toxin forming species,
and the costs of following the approach presented in the guidelines at Appendix B for scombroid toxin forming species.

C. Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This proposed action will reduce the amount of illness that derives from consumption of seafood (safety benefits)
and may have significant nutrition benefits that result from increased consumption of seafood. The increased consumption
will result from a decrease in consumer anxiety associated with the consumption of seafood. In addition, there may
be significant cost savings (benefits) in other areas as a result of adoption of this proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existence of a national, mandatory, HACCP-based inspection system for seafood should have a beneficial, although
nonquantifiable effect on both the industry and the Federal government. FDA knows from experience that continuing
concerns about the adequacy of the current Federal regulatory system for seafood place a financial stress on industry,
which must constantly defend itself from criticism, and on regulatory agencies such as FDA, which must divert resources
in order to respond to the Congress and the media. While public interest in food safety is healthy and desirable, the
extreme interest in seafood safety, which has manifested itself in over 10 congressional hearings and over 20 pieces
of legislation in the past 5 years, demonstrates how a system that is less than fully adequate from the public's standpoint
can cause a steady diversion of both public and private resources that is likely to continue in the absence of a system
that overcomes current inefficiencies and shortcomings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, there will be an additional benefit to firms wishing to export seafood to those countries which require federally
monitored HACCP. The latter two benefits have not been quantified, and FDA requests comments on how this might be done.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency followed three steps to quantify the safety benefits of HACCP for processors: (1) Identify all significant
hazards associated with seafood safety and establish the baseline number of incidents of each hazard in the U.S. population;
(2) estimate the reduction in the number of incidents of each hazard that HACCP is expected to accomplish; and (3) quantify
the benefit of the reduced illnesses and deaths. In all three steps, FDA acknowledges that there is substantial uncertainty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, to establish a baseline number of illnesses, FDA reviewed both reported data to the CDCP, which provides a lower
bound on the actual number of cases, and an earlier FDA risk assessment that estimated an upper-bound number of cases.
Using information about the probable amount of underreporting for each type of illness, FDA constructed a likely
baseline number for each type of illness by inflating these numbers between zero and 1,000 times the amount reported.
Thus, for example, while it is likely that nearly all cases of neurotoxic shellfish poisoning (NSP) are reported to
CDCP, it is likely that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Campylobacter jejuni
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is underreported by approximately 100 times the actual number of cases. This approach for estimating cases yielded
an estimated 33,000 cases of illness from seafood per year. However, FDA acknowledges that even a reasonably precise
estimate of the number of illnesses cannot be determined with the existing foodborne disease reporting mechanisms
in this country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the second step, FDA used a panel of internal experts to determine the number of illnesses the proposed regulations
are likely to reduce.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 For example, it is not likely to reduce any cases of NSP because they are primarily associated with recreational fishing.
On the other hand, it is likely to reduce over 50 percent of scombroid poisoning because most of the mishandling of seafood
comes either at the catch or processing stages. This action will not reduce any cases that are a result of consumer or
retailer mishandling but, as explained earlier in this document, problems at the retail level are addressed through
mechanisms outside of this proposed regulation. FDA has estimated that between 5,000 and 19,000 cases of seafood
illness and death will be reduced by the proposed action annually.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the third step, FDA used economic valuation techniques to quantify the effect of reducing the range of cases of seafood
illness. This technique combines costs of illness, such as hospital costs, with the costs of pain and suffering in
a reduced health state to estimate the cost of each hazard. Thus, for example, NSP, with very mild symptoms, has a low
cost per case ($270), whereas 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Vibrio vulnificus,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with a high probability of death, has a very high cost ($1.3 million per case). Using this methodology, the total safety
benefits of the proposed option are valued between $15 and $75 million per year.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has also evaluated the potential health benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with increased consumption of seafood. Because of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative publicity concerning water pollution and seafood safety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer perception of seafood safety may overestimate actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk. In addition, contamination scares cause drastic short-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drops in consumer demand for seafood products and undoubtedly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to the chronic level of consumer concern about seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety. Thus, safety concerns about seafood are a likely factor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventing wider consumer acceptance of seafood as part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. diet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If this proposal is finalized, consumer concerns about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood safety may be reduced which may, in turn, lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased consumption of seafood. FDA has evaluated the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility that consumers may switch from higher fat flesh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein, such as meat and poultry, to seafood. The resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced dietary fat in the diet of the general population would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in reduced incidence of coronary heart disease and cancer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Using the same methodology employed in an earlier analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA analyzed the benefits of a 1- and 5-pound per capita increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in consumption of seafood. These were estimated to decrease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deaths by 673 and 2,782, respectively, over a 10-year period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The resulting benefits are valued at $3 and $14 billion.

D. Small Business Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule will have a substantial impact on small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood processors as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eighty percent of the seafood processors covered by this proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation are small, where small is defined for nonshrimp firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as less than $1 million in annual gross revenue and less than $2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million for shrimp firms. The provisions of this rule, such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and recordkeeping, are largely fixed costs (costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which do not vary significantly with the amount of the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced) which will impose larger per unit costs on small rather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than on large businesses. In addition, small firms may have as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many critical control points as large firms because critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control points tend to be related to the complexity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation, not the size of the business. However, it may be that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smaller firms are less complex than large firms, although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency does not have sufficient data to determine if this is so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases the increase in cost will be large enough to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause some firms to go out of business. For example, estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of firm failure have been as low as 2 percent (96 firms) of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
firms (from the Canadian experience) to 334 firms (estimated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with MSSP). However, FDA does not have enough 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information to estimate the number of firms that will close if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule becomes final. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several factors that affect the ability of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors to comply with the proposed regulations. First, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basic HACCP requirements proposed in subpart A of part 123 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deliberately include only the essentials of HACCP in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
keep fixed costs to a minimum. Second, FDA is developing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerable guidance in the form of a hazard guide and model 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP plans to enable small processors to implement an effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP system at the lowest possible cost. Third, FDA is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aware that academia and trade associations are available to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assist processors to implement HACCP. Finally, for those small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors that have very simple operations requiring few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control points, an inherent feature of HACCP is that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusts to the complexity and risks of an operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While any closure is regrettable, the agency strongly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that firms that are unable to identify the likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazards associated with their products and take reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preventive controls to prevent those hazards from occurring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be selling food in interstate commerce. As described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the preamble, FDA is keenly interested in keeping the costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing HACCP to a minimum and is issuing guidance documents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and model HACCP plans to facilitate such implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is specifically requesting comment in areas where costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and benefit estimates are either very uncertain or potentially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large. FDA will utilize answers received on these comments along 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with all other comments to help formulate the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA specifically requests comments on: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The expected cost to retrofit plants as necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proper operation of HACCP controls (e.g., enhance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerator capacity, water supply changes, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The cost of taking corrective actions to respond to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limit deviations on an annual basis. FDA has estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an average of $1,000 per firm to take such actions as discarding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, buying new equipment, and changing the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The cost of training employees. FDA has estimated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there will be a cost per plant of $900 to train an employee to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manage HACCP. This will include the cost of training, travel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expenses, and loss of several days of productivity for that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employee. Not all of these costs may be borne by manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, because some training may be sponsored by academia, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trade associations, and others. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The cost of ensuring that cooking and pasteurizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment and processes are achieving the desired safety results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i.e., destroying microbiological pathogens). This ensurance may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be obtained by having equipment and processes that are equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to those found effective by a processing authority. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated that this would cost $1,000 per plant in the first year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, on average, half that amount in the following years as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors change their processes and equipment. This cost may be offset, however, by reliance on literature that
contains the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary information from a processing authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The cost of temperature indicators and thermometers for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants who do not now have this equipment. FDA estimated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cost would be $1,000 per plant, initially, with replacement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The cost of creating a HACCP plan from the guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by FDA. FDA estimated that it will take processors with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simpler processes 24 hours of managerial time to adapt the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance into a HACCP plan. FDA estimated that it will take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors with more complex processes 72 hours of managerial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time to adapt the guidance into a HACCP plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) FDA requests comment on the recordkeeping burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the proposed sanitation requirements in &sect;123.10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) and (c). If possible, such estimates should be provided in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of hours spent and translated into dollars if staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compensation rates are known. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, FDA was unable to provide cost estimates of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following provisions and requests specific comments on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(2) FDA also specifically requests comments on the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of cases of illness included in the baseline estimate (33,035) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may be due to factors outside the processors' control, such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as those due to recreational harvests (that are not eventually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sent to processors), those due to restaurants and supermarkets, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and those due to consumer mishandling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) As mentioned above, FDA has also estimated potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits associated with increased seafood consumption. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits will only be realized if the price increase resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from this rule does not offset the effect of increased demand for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood which will result from reduced consumer anxiety. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests specific comment on the likelihood that seafood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption will be increased as a result of this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) FDA has identified but not quantified benefits to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seafood exporters as well as reduced public anxiety associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the safety of seafood. FDA requests comments on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits (including how to quantify them) as well as other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential benefits such as how HACCP will help firms gain better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control over their operations, better sanitation and greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiencies such as reduced product waste.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
E. Tribal Governments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA is aware that some tribal governments are involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing of seafood for interstate commerce. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expects that the proposed regulations will apply to them in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases. Executive Order 12875 of October 26, 1993, requires, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among other things, consultation with tribal governments before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the formal promulgation of regulations containing unfunded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal mandates. While FDA does not believe that the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations would impose an unfunded Federal mandate, the agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wishes to foster consultation on matters that might significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect tribal communities. Consequently, FDA specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comment on the economic effect of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations on tribal governments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
F. Availability of PRIA/RFA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FDA acknowledges considerable uncertainty in both cost and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit estimates of the proposed regulations and requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on all aspects of the PRIA and the RFA. The full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PRIA/RIA is available at the Dockets Management Branch (address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above).

XI. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The agency has carefully considered the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action will not have a significant impact on the human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Every processor and importer shall have and implement a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written HACCP plan that is specific to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Each location where fish and fishery products are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed by that processor; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Each kind of fish and fishery product processed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor. The plan may group kinds of fish and fishery products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together if the hazards, critical control points, critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits, and procedures required to be identified in paragraph (b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section are identical for all fish and fishery products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so grouped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The HACCP plan shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Identify the safety hazards that are reasonably likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to occur and that thus must be controlled for each fish and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery product, including, as appropriate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Natural toxins; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Microbiological contamination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Chemical contamination; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Pesticides; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Drug residues; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Decomposition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Parasites; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) Unapproved direct and indirect food and color 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additives; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ix) Physical hazards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Identify the critical control points for each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified hazards; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Identify the critical limits that must be met at each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the critical control points; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Identify the procedures, and frequency thereof, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the use of consumer complaints received by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor or importer, that will be used to control and monitor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each of the critical control points to ensure compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical limits. Such procedures shall include the calibration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of process control instruments and validation of software for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
computer control systems as appropriate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Provide for a recordkeeping system that will document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the monitoring of the critical control points. The records shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain the actual values obtained during monitoring. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records shall also include consumer complaints that relate to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of critical control points or possible critical limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) In addition, the HACCP plan should: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Identify other consumer hazards not related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of the product, including, but not necessarily limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Decomposition not associated with human illness; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Economic adulteration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Provide for control of these hazards in the manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described by paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(5) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Failure of a processor or importer to have and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement an HACCP plan that complies with this section or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operate in accordance with the requirements of this part, shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
render the products of that processor or importer adulterated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Corrective actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Any critical limit deviation shall require: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Segregation and holding of the affected product, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least until the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section are met; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Immediate review by an individual or individuals who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been trained in accordance with &sect;123.9, to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptability of the lot in question for distribution, based on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judgment as to whether the deviation may have rendered the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product in that lot injurious to health or otherwise adulterated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Corrective action, when necessary, with respect to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected product and the critical control point at which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation occurred; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Timely assessment by an individual or individuals who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been trained in accordance with &sect;123.9, to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether the process or Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HACCP) plan needs to be modified to reduce the risk of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recurrence of the deviation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Modification when necessary as it applies to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process or HACCP plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) When a processor or importer receives a consumer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complaint that may be related to the performance of a critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control point or that may reflect a critical limit deviation, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall determine whether corrective action as described by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a) of this section is appropriate and, if so, it shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take such action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All actions required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section shall be documented in records that are subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;123.8.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Every plant should have a written standard operating procedure (SOP) for assuring the maintenance of proper sanitary
conditions and practices during processing that is specific to each fish and fishery product produced at that location.
The SOP should include, at a minimum, requirements as described in paragraph (a) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f)(1) All fish to be smoked or salted shall be eviscerated and free of residual viscera, except for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Small species of fish, such as anchovies and herring sprats, provided that they are processed in a fashion so that
they contain a water-phase salt level of at least 10 percent, a water activity below 0.85, or a pH of 4.6 or less; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Fish that are fully cooked before further processing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Evisceration shall be conducted in an area that is segregated and separate from other processing operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section sets forth the specific obligations of importers of fish and fishery products into the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) An importer of fish or fishery products shall have and implement a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP)
plan in accordance with &sect;123.6 that describes how the fish will be prepared, packed, or held while it is in the
control of the importer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The importer of fish or fishery products shall have on file the HACCP plans of each of its foreign processors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The importer shall take affirmative steps to ensure that the fish and fishery products that it offers for import
were produced under the HACCP plan that it has in its possession and subject to the sanitation controls listed in &sect;123.10.
Such steps may include, but would not be limited to:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Obtaining from the foreign processor the HACCP monitoring records that relate to the specific fish or fishery
products being offered for import.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Obtaining a certificate from a foreign government inspection authority certifying that the firm is operating
under a valid HACCP plan or certification on a lot-by-lot basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Regularly inspecting its suppliers' facilities to ensure that they are being operated in compliance with the
applicable HACCP plan and &sect;123.10.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Other such verification measures as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) An importer's obligation under paragraph (c) of this section will be satisfied if the importer imports product
from a country that has an active memorandum of understanding (MOU), or similar agreement, with FDA that documents
the equivalency of the inspection system of the foreign country with the U.S. system. The active MOU will be expected
to accurately reflect the current situation between the signing parties and be functioning and enforceable in its
entirety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Importers should encourage foreign processors to obtain HACCP training similar to that required by &sect;123.9.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) There must be evidence that seafood that is offered for import has been produced under conditions that comply with
subpart A of this part. Such evidence can be provided by:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Examination, at the U.S. importer's place of business, of the importer's Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point
(HACCP) plan, the foreign processor's HACCP plan and sanitation procedures and records associated with the importer's
plan that demonstrate that the plan and procedures were followed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An active memorandum of understanding (as defined in &sect;123.11(d)) with an exporting country that provides
that the country will impose regulatory controls equivalent to those established in this part for domestic processors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Evidence that an exporting country has in place and is enforcing an HACCP-based regulatory system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Inspection of foreign processors by FDA or some other organization designated by FDA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This Appendix provides guidance on how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet the requirements of 21 CFR part 123, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A for the processing of cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready-to-eat fishery products. Cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ready-to-eat fishery products are those that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are subjected by a commercial processor to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either a cooking process before being placed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a final container, or to pasteurization in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final container, or to both. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance involves processing procedures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are common to most of these products for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of the microbiological hazards to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which they are particularly susceptible. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance does not apply to environmental or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other hazards that might occur before the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor takes possession of the product or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw materials. (Guidance on these hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be found in a separate guidance document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all fish and fishery products to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued by FDA.) This guidance also does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply to cooked, ready-to-eat fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products covered by 21 CFR part 123, subpart B.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The Cooking Process. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be able to demonstrate to itself and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA that its cooking process ensures the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destruction of vegetative cells of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms of public health concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This may be accomplished by having a cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process that is at least equivalent to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process established by a process authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To demonstrate equivalence, a processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should have on file in its Hazard Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical Control Point (HACCP) records a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Describes the results of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific evaluation, conducted by a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, of the adequacy of the cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Identifies and establishes values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for key aspects of the process or of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product that may affect the adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destruction of microorganisms of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health concern. At a minimum, these values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should include cooking times and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such a document may consist of, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be limited to, a letter from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process authority, articles in scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
journals, or Federal, State, or local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government regulations or advisories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to have documentation that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking process will achieve its goal will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
violate 21 CFR 123.8 and will mean that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product produced by the processor will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced under insanitary conditions whereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it may be rendered injurious to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Cooking Equipment Design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The processor must be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate to itself and to FDA that its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking equipment can deliver the cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process that ensures the destruction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vegetative cells of microorganisms of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health concern. One way to accomplish this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is for the processor to have on file in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP records a document that describes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results of a scientific evaluation, conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a process authority, of the design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the type of equipment and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operational procedures used by the processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The engineering specifications for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment used by the processor (e.g., pipe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sizes, flow rates, loading configuration,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
venting parameters) should meet or exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those for the equipment evaluated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process authority. Failure to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation that the cooking equipment will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve its goal will violate 21 CFR 123.8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will mean that the product produced by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor will be produced under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insanitary conditions whereby it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rendered injurious to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Cooking equipment should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with both a temperature-indicating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device and temperature-recording device. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating device should be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference instrument for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformance to the established process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring records made by the processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should record both the actual values that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurring for those key aspects of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process identified by the process authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 4.a.1. of this Appendix and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual values that are occurring for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operational procedures identified by the

4. Special Considerations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 For the cooking of blue crab 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Callinectes sapidus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
), dungeness crab (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Cancer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magister
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
), or king crab (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Paralithodes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
camtschatica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
), the known lethality of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooking process necessary to make the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally acceptable for human consumption, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or to enable further processing, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient so that the adequacy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process and the equipment can normally be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The Pasteurization Process.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor must be able to demonstrate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
itself and to FDA that its pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process ensures the adequate reduction of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers of viable spores of microorganisms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health concern. One way to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this is to have a pasteurization process that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is equivalent to a process established by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process authority. To demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalence, a processor should have on file 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in its HACCP records a document that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 i. Describes the results of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific evaluation conducted by a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority of the adequacy of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization process; and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ii. Identifies and establishes values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for those key aspects of the process, or of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product, that may affect the adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in numbers of microorganisms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health concern. At a minimum, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
values should include pasteurization times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Such document may consist of, but should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be limited to, a letter from a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, articles in scientific journals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or Federal, State or local government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations or advisories. Failure to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation that the pasteurization process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will achieve its goal will violate 21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
123.8 and will mean that the product produced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the processor will be produced under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insanitary conditions whereby it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rendered injurious to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Pasteurization Equipment Design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 i. The processor must be able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate to itself and to FDA that its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization equipment can deliver the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization process that ensures the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate reduction of viable spores of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms of public health concern. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way to accomplish this is to have on file a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document that describes the results of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific evaluation conducted by a process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority, of the design and operation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
type of equipment used by the processor. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engineering specifications for the equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used by the processor (e.g., pipe sizes, flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates, loading configuration) should meet or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed those for the equipment evaluated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the process authority. Failure to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation that the pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment will achieve its goals will violate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21 CFR 123.8 and will mean that the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced by the processor will be produced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under insanitary conditions whereby it may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rendered injurious to health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ii. Pasteurization equipment should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipped with both a temperature-indicating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device and temperature-recording device. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating device should be the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference instrument for determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conformance to the established process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 3. Records.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Monitoring records made by the processor should record the actual values 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are occurring for those key aspect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the process identified by the process

5. Container Integrity Critical Controls Points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Finished Product Container Sealing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Finished product containers must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspected, and the results recorded, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container integrity to assure a consistently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliable hermetic seal. FDA recommends that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 1. Visual seam inspection of one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
container from each seaming head occur every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 minutes; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 2. Testing by qualified personnel of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one container from each seaming head occur at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least every 4 hours. As applicable, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tests should be performed in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21 CFR 113.60(a)(1) and (a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

b. Post-pasteurization Cooling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Container cooling water must contain a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurable residual of chlorine or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizer. Tests to determine the presence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a measurable residual of chlorine or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitizer in the container cooling water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be made, and the results recorded, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient frequency to ensure control.

a. Cooling After Cooking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
After cooking, the product must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rapidly cooled to minimize recontamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Continuous cooling from 140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (60 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve an internal temperature of 70

internal temperature of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below within an additional 4 hours, unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing after cooking, as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 6.b. of this Appendix, occurs during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either of these time periods, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively minimize recontamination. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature parameters may also be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective. Processors should ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling parameters are met by either:

 i. Conducting or obtaining a study that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishes that appropriate cooling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures are always met under prescribed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing conditions. The study should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish the limits of significant variables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that could affect the rate of cooling. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variables may include product size, ambient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air temperature, and amount of product in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooler. An adequate study should consist of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least three processing runs under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed processing conditions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 ii. Monitoring and recording the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Products that will receive processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after cooking should not be exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ambient temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher for longer than a cumulative total of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4 hours after cooking. If they are exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to such temperatures for more than 4 hours, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unacceptable recontamination is the likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result. Processors are required to regularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor and record the length of time that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product is exposed to temperatures above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) under 21 CFR 123.8. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommends that such monitoring and recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be done at least every 2 hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Temperature-indicating devices should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed where they can be easily read and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located to ensure that they accurately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measure the warmest temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigeration equipment and the coldest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the heating equipment, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate. Temperature-indicating devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be calibrated at the routine operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the refrigeration, cooling, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heating equipment against a known accurate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard thermometer upon installation and at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least once a year thereafter, or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently, if necessary, to ensure their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy. Records required to be maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 21 CFR 123.8 of accuracy checks for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating devices should specify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the date, standard used, method used, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results, and person performing the test. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating device that has a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided fluid column or that cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjusted to the standard should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately repaired or replaced.

b. Temperature-Recording Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Temperature-recording devices should be installed where they can be easily read and the sensors for such devices
should be installed to ensure that they accurately measure the warmest temperature of the refrigeration equipment
and the coldest temperature of the heating equipment, as appropriate. Computerized storage of temperature data
may be used in place of recorder thermometer charts if the use of such a system has been validated and can be shown to be
substantially equivalent to the use of a temperature-recording device. Each temperature-recording device should
be checked for accuracy at the beginning and end of each production day and adjusted as necessary to agree as nearly
as possible with the reference temperature-indicating device. A record of these accuracy checks should be maintained
that specifies the time, date, temperatures indicated by both devices before adjustment, corrective action taken,
where applicable, and person performing the accuracy check.

8. Corrective Actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 21 CFR 123.7, whenever a deviation occurs at a critical control point, the processor shall segregate and hold
the product until a review can be made to determine the effect of that deviation, and shall take corrective action as
necessary. For cooked, ready-to-eat products, when a deviation occurs at a cooking or pasteurization critical control
point, the processor should meet the requirements of &sect;123.7 either by destroying the product; by fully reprocessing,
where possible, that portion of the production involved, keeping full records of the reprocessing conditions; or
by setting aside that portion of the product involved for further evaluation as to any potential public health significance.
Such an evaluation should be made by a process authority and should be in accordance with procedures recognized by
process authorities as being adequate to detect any unacceptable hazard to public health. Unless this evaluation
demonstrates that the product had been given a thermal process that rendered it free of microorganisms of potential
public health significance or, in the case of pasteurization, that resulted in the adequate reduction in numbers
of microorganisms, the product set aside should be either fully reprocessed to correct the deficiency or destroyed.
A record should be made of the evaluation procedures used and the results. Either upon completion of full reprocessing
or after the determination that no significant public health hazard exists, that portion of the product involved
may be shipped in normal distribution. Otherwise, the portion of the product involved should be destroyed.

9. Sanitary Zones 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the requirements of 21 CFR 123.10, sanitary zones should be established around areas in which cooked
product is handled or stored. In such areas, objects and employees that have come into contact with waste, raw product,
or other insanitary objects are excluded. Packaging material, equipment, employees, and in-process materials
that enter a sanitary zone should be treated in a manner that will minimize the risk of the introduction of microorganisms.
Air handling systems should be designed to minimize the risk of airborne contamination and to provide positive air
pressure in the sanitary zone relative to the surrounding areas.

1. General Guidelines for Scombroid Toxin Forming Species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This Appendix provides guidance on how to meet the requirements of 21 CFR part 123, subpart A for fish and fishery products
that consist in whole or in part of scombroid toxin forming species. These include tuna, bluefish, mahi mahi, mackerel,
sardines, herring, kahawai, anchovies, marlin, and other species, whether or not of the family Scombridae, in which
significant levels of histamine may be produced in the fish flesh by decarboxylation of free histidine as a result
of exposure of the fish after capture to temperatures that permit the growth of mesophilic bacteria. The guidance
focuses on preventing the formation of scombrotoxin, which can be harmful to humans, as a consequence of improper
handling after capture, i.e., time and temperature abuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Critical Control Points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Every processor who engages in processing other than, or in addition to, storing of fish or fishery products that consist
in whole or in part of scombroid forming species, must ensure that neither decomposition leading to histamine formation,
nor histamine formation, has occurred before receipt of such fish or fishery products. Processors must also ensure
that neither decomposition leading to histamine formation, nor histamine formation, occurs as a result of inadequate
handling practices by the processor. In order to prevent these hazards from occurring, Hazard Analysis Critical
Control Point (HACCP) plans prepared in accordance with 21 CFR part 123, subpart A will typically identify and address
the receipt of raw materials, as well as processing, as critical control points. In accordance with 21 CFR part 123,
subpart A, processors shall identify in their HACCP plans how they will control hazards at critical control points.
This appendix provides guidance on how to do so with respect to scombroid toxin forming species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Receipt of Raw Materials Critical Control Point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
a. First Processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
On-board handling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The first processor to take ownership after harvest of fish and fishery products of scombroid toxin forming species
should ensure that vessels supplying such fish have in place measures to ensure that the fish were rapidly brought
to, and maintained at, an internal temperature of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below, and were not held for a period of time sufficient to allow histamine formation to begin at the temperature
at which they were held. The processor may determine the time and temperature history of the fish by requiring certification
of the fishing method and on-board handling practices, and a time/temperature log from the harvesting vessel. The
time/temperature log should record, for each lot of fish, the date of harvest, fishing method, temperature of the
harvest water, and temperature history of the fish relating to the lowering of the internal temperature. The temperature
history of the fish may be documented by controlling and recording the key aspects of the cooling and storage operation
(e.g., refrigerated brine or seawater temperature, fish size, and container packing). For purposes of this guideline,
a lot of fish is the fish in a vessel storage compartment (i.e., well, tote, or other container). The log should be sufficient
to enable the processor to determine whether the fish were subject to conditions in the water after capture, on the
harvesting vessel, or in storage, that could cause, or significantly contribute to, the formation of histamine in
the fish.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Sampling and examination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor, as described in section 3.a.1. of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Appendix, should subject a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sample of fish in each lot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the vessel to an external organoleptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination for decomposition and should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record the results of the examination. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sample should provide at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
95 percent confidence that decomposition does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not exist in more than 2.5 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish in the lot. If the number of fish from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a vessel is small enough to permit an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination of each fish, e.g., because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weight of each fish is typically greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 pounds, the processor is encouraged to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examine each fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Any fish that exhibits decomposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should either be rejected and not used for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
food, or reconditioned according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor's established procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconditioning should include, at a minimum, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal of all parts of the fish that exhibit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any decomposition, organoleptic reexamination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the remaining fish flesh, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performance of a histamine analysis on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining fish flesh. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. If no decomposition in any fish in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a lot is detected through organoleptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
examination, the following should apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. If the time/temperature log as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the conditions on the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were unlikely to cause, or significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to, the formation of histamine in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish, all the fish from that lot may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further processed or enter commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. If the time/temperature log as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the conditions on the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were likely to cause, or significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to, the formation of histamine in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish in a lot, or if no adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature log is available, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine analysis should be made on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sample of fish from that lot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iii. If decomposition is detected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than 2.5 percent of the fish from a lot, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following should apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. If the time/temperature log as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the conditions on the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were unlikely to cause, or significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to, the formation of histamine in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish in a particular lot, those fish from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lot found to have decomposition should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be treated in accordance with section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.a.2.i. of this Appendix. Other fish from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lot may be further processed or enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commerce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. If the time/temperature log as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the conditions on the vessel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were likely to cause, or significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to, the formation of histamine in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish in a particular lot, or if no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate time/temperature log is available, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor should perform a histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis on a representative sample of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptically acceptable fish from that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lot. (However, if the processor elects to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform a histamine analysis on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative sample of each lot of fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the vessel before conducting an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptic analysis for decomposition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because, for example, the processor received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish in a frozen state, the histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis does not have to be repeated based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on results of subsequent organoleptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
iv. If decomposition is detected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than 2.5 percent of the fish from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular lot, the processor should perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a histamine analysis on a representative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample of organoleptically acceptable fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from that lot.

Histamine Findings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. If any fish from a particular lot is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found to have histamine above a defect action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level or other regulatory level or limit for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine established by FDA, the fish in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that lot may not be used for food. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. If any fish from a particular lot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is found to have histamine below the defect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action level or other regulatory level or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit for histamine established by FDA but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above levels expected of fresh fish, the fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from that lot should enter commerce only if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
first immediately cooked to prevent histamine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from increasing to unacceptable levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

fish and fish products of scombroid toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forming species and who engage in processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than, or in addition to, storage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should subject a representative sample each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lot of such fish and fishery products to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organoleptic evaluation for decomposition to

determine whether decomposition occurred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during transfer from the previous processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any fish that exhibits decomposition should

detected in more than 2.5 percent of the fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the lot, the processor should perform a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
histamine analysis on a representative sample

4. Processing Critical Control Point.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Products that are undergoing processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be exposed to ambient temperatures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or higher for more than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cumulative total of 4 hours. Processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should ensure that this requirement is met by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and recording, at least every 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours, the length of time that the product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposed to temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

and misbranding provisions of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sections 402(b) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 403, respectively). This guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applies to controlling economic factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the identity of species, weight, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count and size, and the percentage of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A processor must ensure that the fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fishery products that it receives are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correctly identified as to species at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point of receipt into its processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. Methods used for identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon receipt may include, but are not limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Exams.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Physical examination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Laboratory evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., protein chromatography); and

3. Acceptance of species identity as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified by a supplier under either a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limited or a General and Continuing Guaranty, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as provided for by section 303(c)(2) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7.12 and 7.13).

b. Labeling-Economic Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A processor must ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product labels, labeling, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invoices accurately represent the weight, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
count, and size of the product, as well as the presence and amount of any valuable constituents. An example would be
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling of shrimp and breading material to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make breaded shrimp. The processor must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the shrimp has not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adulterated by the addition of water, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the valuable constituents are present at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels that are consistent with FDA standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of identity (21 CFR part 161) and compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy guides. The processor thus should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for monitoring of the level of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valuable constituents throughout receipt, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing, and distribution to ensure that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Identification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The species is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correctly identified by its common or usual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
name and is so represented on the label and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeling. Guidance in selecting the correct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
common or usual name of a species is provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the FDA Fish List. Specific requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are given in 21 CFR 101.18 and 21 CFR part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
161. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Valuable constituents.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The valuable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents of the product are not omitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or abstracted from the product (e.g., breaded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shrimp contains the required weight ratio of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shrimp to breading and, if appropriate, shrimp of the size and weight specified on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the label or labeling). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Substitution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 No substance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituted wholly or in part for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
valuable constituent (e.g., through added 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water or glazing, or substitution of crab 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavored surimi for crab meat in a product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labeled as crab cake). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Damage or inferiority. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Damage or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inferiority is not concealed in any manner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., through bleaching or coloring of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product to conceal its true nature or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of wholesomeness). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Product adulteration. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
No substance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is added to, or mixed with, the product to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase its bulk or weight or to reduce its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality, or make it appear of better or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater value than it is (e.g., through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adding water to a product by chemical or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other means).

FDA is in the process of developing guidance to, among 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other things, assist the seafood industry develop and implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP systems. The guidance will be titled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ``FDA Fish and Fishery Products Hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Controls Guide.'' When a draft of the entire Guide is completed in the near future, FDA will publish a notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of availability in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

One page each from the ``Vertebrate'' and

``Invertebrate Hazard and Control Lists.'' Together, these lists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain about 350 species of commercially marketed fish. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list is in the form of a chart that directs the reader to one or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more of the 10 numbered hazard and control descriptions elsewhere 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Guide for species-related hazards. For purposes of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guide, species-related hazards are those that can occur in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment or during harvest. Processors should find in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate list the species they handle, then turn to those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbered hazard and control descriptions that are relevant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that species.

and the measures available to control it, with an emphasis on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HACCP controls such as critical control points, critical limits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring procedures and frequencies, recordkeeping, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Example 4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
One page from the ``Process-related Hazards and Controls List.'' For purposes of this Guide, process-related hazards
are those that can occur because of the nature of the processing procedures and the finished product form. This list
includes 20 types of finished products (e.g., cooked shrimp) and directs the reader to one or more of the 22 process-related
hazard and control descriptions, which are located in the next part of the Guide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The process-related hazard and control descriptions are numbered. Some of them are further subdivided into lettered
portions. Where the reader need only refer to a portion of a process-related hazard and control description, the list
directs the reader to that portion by referring to a lettered part of the description. See below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

11'' (pathogen survival during pasteurization)). As with the species-related descriptions discussed above, each
process-related description explains a hazard and the measures available to control it, with an emphasis on HACCP
controls. Some of these descriptions are subdivided. For example, ``Process-related Hazard and Control No. 8,''
which is about temperature abuse, is subdivided into ``8a: Histamine,'' ``8b: Pathogens,'' and ``8c: Decomposition.''

II. Smoked Fishery Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Research conducted since FDA proposed the 1970 final rule shows that less stringent processing temperatures and
lower water-phase salt content, with or without use of other inhibiting factors such as sodium nitrite, can provide
an adequate margin of safety for hot-process products held in refrigerated storage (40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower). FDA has considered this research, and based on it, the agency is proposing a guidance setting forth
what it tentatively finds are the minimum time, temperature, and salinity requirements to make a safe and marketable
smoked fish product. Proposed TTS parameters are found in example 6 of this appendix.

at 38

meat medium held at 41 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F does not occur until after 56 days, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrating that less favorable growth media can significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower the rate of growth. Even in those cases where

C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

generally more ideally suited to growth than those found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonexperimental situations where less favorable growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environments prevail. Thus, while the growth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

not completely inhibited at 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), under the less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ideal conditions for its growth that are generally encountered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processing of smoked fish, FDA has tentatively concluded that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintaining fresh fish at a maximum temperature of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, only 2 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degrees above the temperature of complete growth inhibition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before and during processing will provide adequate protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
outgrowth. Moreover, 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with the maximum temperature FDA has proposed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various guidelines, such as the Unicode (now called the Food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Code) (53 FR 16472, May 9, 1988). Therefore, under proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;123.10(a)(14), all raw fish that is to be smoked must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated until needed for processing (Ref. 175). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, fish that are initially frozen need to remain in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the frozen state until needed for processing (Refs. 161 and 25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When frozen fish are needed for processing, the thawing procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be carried out in a way that minimizes the opportunity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbial growth (Refs. 161 and 171). The method used to thaw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish must provide an environment that will inhibit the growth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
and other microorganisms that pose a potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health hazard (Refs. 171 and 172). Thus, the fish should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thawed in a way that ensures that the internal temperature at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
core of the fish does not exceed 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) (Refs. 171 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
172). Therefore, section 4.a. of Example 6 of this appendix, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency suggests that this procedure be used in the thawing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spore outgrowth and toxin production in smoked and smoke-flavored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish relies on the interrelationship of processing time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing temperature, water-phase salt concentration in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loin muscle, and smoke (or constituents of smoke) deposition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined with refrigerated storage (40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower) (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;123.10(a)(14)) (Ref. 173). At one time, smoking and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated brining may have been an effective preservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method. With the changes in processing techniques that have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred since the advent of refrigeration and in response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers' demands for products with certain organoleptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualities, however, smoked fish products, either hot- or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cold-process, have become perishable products that must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated and cannot be considered preserved foods (Ref. 173). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes that have occurred, both in processing techniques and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in organoleptic qualities, have resulted in products that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more moist and contain less salt. As a result, the two critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing factors that affect the overall preservation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of the product have been altered. The processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time-temperature parameters have been decreased, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt content has been reduced (Ref. 173). Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these products need to be maintained at refrigerated temperatures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower) or frozen immediately after processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure the overall quality of these products (Ref. 173). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Brining/dry salting. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Salt, as a preservative in smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoke-flavored fish, is somewhat limited in its effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the variability in salt uptake by fish flesh, even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among fish in the same brining tank. Ventral muscle, which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thin, absorbs high levels of salt, while the thicker dorsal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
muscles absorb less salt, limiting the effectiveness of salt as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deterrent against spore outgrowth in that part of the fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Equilibration techniques, such as two-stage brining, reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variation in salt content within a fish and increase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preservative effect (Ref. 176). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is possible that salt-tolerant microorganisms of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health concern (such as strains of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Staphylococcus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) may grow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during brining or after the dry salting process. Therefore, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is providing in section 5.c. and 5.e. in example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix that the brining and dry salting of fish be carried out 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at refrigerated temperatures, i.e., 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Doing so will ensure that the environment in which brining is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
done, and in which fish are held after dry-salting, will inhibit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the growth of salt-tolerant microorganisms that can cause a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential health hazard (Ref. 173). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes that when fish are initially added to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brine, the temperature of the brine may increase. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential to this process that the brine be returned to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated temperatures 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower to reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity of microbial growth and to ensure the overall quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the product during the brining process (Refs. 175 and 182). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the agency is suggesting in section 5.d. of Example 6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this appendix that the temperature of the brine not exceed 60 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (16 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) at the start of brining.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To minimize the variation in salt content of the fish, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is recommending in section 5.f. of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix that only fish of the same species and of similar size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and similar weight be brined in the same tank (Refs. 171 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
199). Because reuse of brine solutions is a possible route of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbial contamination of raw fish, the agency is providing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 5.g. of Example 6 of this appendix that brines not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reused unless they have been processed in some way to return them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a microbiological quality equivalent to the original, unused 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brine made with potable water and food-grade salt. The agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also providing in section 5.h. of Example 6 of this appendix that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a processor may rinse the brined fish with fresh water to remove 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any unwanted excess salt on the exterior of the fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Drying. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Fish that are to be processed as smoked or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish are dried after brining to remove excess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water and prevent dripping during smoking. The drying process, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
usually of several hours in duration, provides another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for microbial growth. Therefore, to minimize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for microbial growth by reducing those conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would provide a favorable environment for such growth, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is providing in section 5.i. of Example 6 of this appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the presmoking drying step should be conducted in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated room (Ref. 46). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Smoking.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Smoke deposition, like water-phase salt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content, is very difficult to control. Constituents of smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
called ``inhibitory compounds'' (such as phenolic compounds) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported to have a bactericidal effect (Ref. 177). Factors that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the quantity of inhibitory compounds deposited on the fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface and the degree of penetration by those compounds into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish are the humidity in the smoking chamber, the temperature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking, and the air flow in the smoking chamber (Ref. 178). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Decreased levels of inhibitory compounds reduce the preservative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of the smoke and make dependence on these compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadvisable (Ref. 178). In general, smoked products are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shelf stable and must be either refrigerated at a temperature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower or frozen immediately after processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Refs. 43, 45, and 178). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To promote uniform deposition of smoke, heat exposure, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dehydration, and to ensure that on completion of these processes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish do not contain any raw or wet sections that would create 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an environment favorable for microbial growth and spoilage, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is providing in section 5.j. of Example 6 of this appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that fish should be arranged in the smokehouse chamber or oven so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that they are not overcrowded or touching each other, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only fish of like size and weight should be included in a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
batch of fish for smoking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Liquid smoke, a solution of wood smoke that, when diluted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be used to impart a smoke flavor to fish products, is often 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used as an alternative to generated smoke. Liquid smoke has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported to have similar antibacterial properties to, and some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advantages over, generated smoke (Ref. 26). It is easier to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply uniformly, and the inhibitory compounds penetrate further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the fish flesh (Ref. 26). Liquid smoke, generated smoke, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a combination of liquid smoke and generated smoke needs to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied to all surfaces of fish to be smoked. Liquid smoke may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be applied to the product before, at the commencement of, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the process, while generated smoke needs to be applied to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fish during the first half of the process and longer if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary (Refs. 178 and 179). If a combination of liquid smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and generated smoke is used, the method for use of liquid smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be followed, and the generated smoke may be applied at any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stage of the process (Ref. 26). The agency is providing for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of liquid smoke alone or in combination with generated smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section 3.c.2. of Example 6 of this appendix to impart smoke 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flavor and antibacterial properties to the products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Use of sodium nitrite.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use of sodium nitrite in smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoke-flavored fish products is limited to the species listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;172.175 (21 CFR 172.175) and to chubs in &sect;172.177 (21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
172.177). Section 172.175 permits the use of sodium nitrite as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preservative and color fixative in cured, smoked sablefish, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salmon, and shad. However, it requires that the level of sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nitrite in the final product not exceed 200 ppm. Use of sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nitrite substantially reduces the level of salt necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhibit outgrowth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
type A and type E spores, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although the levels vary because of the difference in heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance between the two types of spores (Ref. 179). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity of sodium nitrite necessary to achieve inhibition is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by both the level of contamination and the resistance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the spores (Refs. 179 and 180). Refrigeration of the finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product at temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below is necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to retain the inhibitory characteristic gained through use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sodium nitrite (Ref. 179). Therefore, in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of &sect;&sect;172.175 and 172.177, the agency is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for the use of sodium nitrite in the processing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging of smoked and smoke-flavored fish in section 5.a. and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 5.b. of Example 6 of this appendix.

Vacuum- and modified atmosphere-packaging. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Vacuum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging and other types of modified atmosphere-packaging (those in which the air in the package or container is

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaced by one or more gases, in various concentrations, before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the package is sealed) extend the shelf life of foods markedly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the anaerobic environment created in these types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaging favors the outgrowth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
spores and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent toxin production, and it inhibits growth of aerobic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microorganisms that might otherwise serve as organoleptic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicators of spoilage (Refs. 180 and 182). Consequently, use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaging demands strict adherence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to temperature-controlled storage and distribution to reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity for spore outgrowth and toxin production and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the potential growth of other microorganisms of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health significance (such as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
L. monocytogenes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two methods of reducing the potential public health hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of vacuum or modified atmosphere packaged smoked, smoke-flavored, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and salted fish products are: (1) To store and distribute the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products frozen or, alternatively, (2) to use in-package heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing followed by refrigeration. At freezer temperatures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outgrowth of spores of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
types B, E, and F is retarded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

&cir;F (10 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) (Refs. 179 and 180). Storage and distribution in the frozen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state reduces the possibility that temperature abuse will occur.

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 55 minutes, inhibits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outgrowth and toxin production by type E spores (Ref. 185). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Longer exposure to processing temperatures is required for more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat resistant spores, such as types B and A (Ref. 185). In a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study examining this method of packaging, samples of hot-process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salmon steaks were injected with spores of nonproteolytic strains

time-temperature combinations. The results of this research

showed that closely controlled in-package heat processing extends

more suitable for pieces, fillets, and steaks than for whole

C. Specific Processing Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The various processing techniques used to produce smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish are affected by the interrelationship of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking, the method of smoke application, the time-temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combinations used, and the water-phase salt content. A critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor in determining alternative processing methods is the type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of packaging utilized, specifically whether the product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air-packaged or vacuum-packaged. The following discussion sets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out the various processing procedures that the agency has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively concluded will ensure the safety of hot-process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoked and smoke-flavored fish, and cold-process smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Research data and industry practice show that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower minimum water-phase salt content (3.5 percent or lower), in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combination with lower processing temperatures (lower than 180 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(82 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C)) than cited in the 1970 final rule for hot-process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products are effective in inhibiting spore outgrowth and toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production when the products are not vacuum-packaged and are held 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at refrigerated temperatures (40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower) (Refs. 24, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
163, and 177). Research studies from the National Marine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fisheries Service and testimony presented at a public hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
held by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on May 3, 1989, to establish a CGMP for the manufacture of smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoke-flavored fish products, show that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
type E 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is inhibited in air-packaged smoked fish products when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt content is at least 3.0 percent, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing internal temperature of the product is maintained at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum of 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (63 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for at least 30 minutes (Ref. 180). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light of these findings, FDA is setting forth these processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters in Example 6 of this appendix to provide guidance on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the safe manufacturing of these products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is setting forth the following minimum T-T-S 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters for air-packed, hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish in section 5.a.1. of Example 6 of this appendix: Heating at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an internal temperature of 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (63 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt content of 3.0 percent in the finished product.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Vacuum-packaged/modified atmosphere.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum-packaged products, National Marine Fisheries Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research shows that processing temperatures in the range of 145 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 175
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F (63 to 80 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for hot-process smoked fish will inhibit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 type E when the water-phase salt content is greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 3.5 percent (Refs. 26, 173, and 180). Based on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence, New York's CGMP included a procedure for processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum-packaged smoked fish that specifies heating the fish to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal temperature of 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (63 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 30 minutes, with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt content of 3.5 percent (Ref. 25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of sodium nitrite in combination with sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloride significantly inhibits the outgrowth and toxin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
type E. Research data show that when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the water-phase salt content and sodium nitrite content are at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least 3.1 percent and 100 ppm, respectively, and the internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the fish is not less than 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, the inhibitory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
growth and toxin production greatly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases (Refs. 173 and 179). At higher processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures, e.g., 180 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (82 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C), a water-phase salt content of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3.0 percent or more inhibits toxin formation by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E (Ref. 163). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this information, the agency is setting forth the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following T-T-S parameters for vacuum-packaged hot-process smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and smoke-flavored fish in section 5.a.2. of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix: (1) Heating at an internal temperature of at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (63 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 30 minutes with a minimum water-phase salt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
content of 3.5 percent in the finished product, or (2) heating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at an internal temperature of at least 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (63 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 30 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minutes, with a minimum water-phase salt content of 3.0 percent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a sodium nitrite content of 100 to 200 ppm (as permitted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the food additive regulations in &sect;172.175) in the finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, or (3) as described in &sect;172.177 for smoked chub

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency points out that these processing parameters for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum-packaged hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimums. Unless the comments on Example 6 of this appendix 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convince the agency otherwise, fish that have been processed at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower temperature or with a lower water-phase salt level could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the basis for regulatory action on the grounds that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product has been processed under conditions whereby it may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been reduced injurious to health and thus could represent a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazard for consumers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish, by virtue of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures used in processing, are not cooked because they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processed at temperatures lower than those that coagulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protein, i.e., 100 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (38 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower. Because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures are not high enough to inactivate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spores, and because they provide a favorable environment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other food spoilage microorganisms, other inhibitive factors, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as higher salt content and sodium nitrite (where permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by food additive regulations in &sect;172.175) need to be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The time and temperature relationship in the processing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cold-smoked and smoke-flavored fish is a critical factor in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yielding a microbiologically safe and high quality finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product (Ref. 182). Modern establishments that cold-smoked fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally process between 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (5 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) and 100 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (38 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) for 18 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 24 hours (Refs. 171 and 182). Based on the research data that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are available and the requirements in the New York CGMP, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is proposing the following requirements for air-packaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and vacuum-packaged/modified atmosphere cold-process smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish (Refs. 25, 180, and 184). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Air-packaged products. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is providing in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 5.a.3. of Example 6 of this appendix that air-packed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish should have a minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt content of: (1) 3.5 percent, or (2) 3.0 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent and contain 100 to 200 ppm of sodium nitrite in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product, or (3) 2.5 percent in the finished product if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product is frozen immediately after processing and cooling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is kept frozen throughout holding and distribution. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is providing that the finished product that contains a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt content of 2.5 percent should be frozen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately and kept frozen to ensure the microbiological safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the product, as well as to maintain the shelf-life of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, because these products are not cooked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain a low water-phase salt content, these products may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present a potential public health hazard because they provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ideal environment for the outgrowth of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
spores and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxin production. Therefore, based on the discussion above, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is suggesting that air-packaged cold-process smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish be processed under one of the following sets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of conditions: (1) A maximum 20-hour drying and smoking period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the temperature in the smoking chamber not exceeding 90 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(32 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) (section 5.a.3.i. of Example 6 of this appendix), or (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a maximum 24-hour drying and smoking period with the temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the smoking chamber not exceeding 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) (section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.a.3.ii. of Example 6 of this appendix) except that sablefish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs to be heated to a temperature not to exceed 120 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (49 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a period not to exceed 6 hours (section 5.a.3.iii. of example 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6 of this appendix) (Refs. 25, 180, and 184). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Vacuum-/modified atmosphere-packaged products. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing in section 5.a.4. of Example 6 of this appendix that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish to be vacuum- or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modified atmosphere-packaged should have a minimum water-phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salt content of: (1) 3.0 percent and contain 100 to 200 ppm of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sodium nitrite in the finished product, or (2) 3.5 percent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the finished product when no sodium nitrite is used. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is also providing that vacuum-/modified atmosphere-packaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish should be processed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under one of the following sets of conditions: (1) A maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20-hour drying and smoking period with the temperature in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking chamber not exceeding 90 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (32 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) (section 5.a.3.i. of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Example 6 of this appendix), or (2) a maximum 24-hour drying and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking period with the temperature in the smoking chamber not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) (section 5.a.3.ii. of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix) (Refs. 25, 180, and 184). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency again points out that these processing parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for vacuum-/modified atmosphere-packaged cold-process smoked and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored fish are minimums. Failure to adhere to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters could provide the basis for regulatory action because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product that results may be injurious to health and thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could represent a hazard to consumers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency believes that the proposed processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored products, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air-packed and vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaged, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produce a safe and commercially acceptable product. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because less data and information are available for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products than for hot-process products, the agency is requesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific comments, data, and information about these processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters and any alternative processing parameters that should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be included in the guideline.

&cir;C) or below are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
essential for all smoked, smoke-flavored, and salted fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products to minimize microbial growth. The exceptions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cold-process air-packaged products that contain a water-phase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salt content of 2.5 percent, which should be frozen immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after processing and remain frozen throughout distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the lower water-phase salt content and lower 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing temperatures that may provide an opportunity for food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spoilage microorganisms to flourish during storage (see section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At section 6 of Example 6 of the appendix, the agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommending specific time/temperature controls for processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after smoking. These proposed controls are the same as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed for after cooking in the cooked, ready-to-eat section of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this document (Appendix A, section 6). A full discussion of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls is provided in section VII.J.3. of this document.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Alternative processing parameters.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 As this preamble 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates, FDA has tentatively concluded that the TTS processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters reflected in this appendix are the minimum necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that these products are free from botulinum toxin over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their shelf life. FDA has also tentatively concluded that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
T-T-S parameters, coupled with good sanitation practices, will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also render these products listeria free. Nonetheless, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency does not wish to discourage the development and use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative procedures that are capable of achieving the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, section 11 of Example 6 of this appendix calls 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the use of alternative processing parameters when the user 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can demonstrate the following: (1) For botulism, zero toxin

 in the final product. The data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrating these outcomes would have to be available to FDA to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable the agency to determine whether they have been achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Example 6 of this appendix states that those data should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part of a processor's HACCP records. FDA asks for comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether a third-party scientific expert, or processing authority, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be involved in the development of the data that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate the effectiveness of the alternative procedure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of vacuum- and modified atmosphere-packaging.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained above, vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaged smoked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored, and salted fish products represent an increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health hazard over conventionally packaged products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because these types of packaging provide the ideal environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for spore outgrowth and toxin production. Based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion above, the agency states in section 3 of Example 6 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this appendix that these types of packaging should be used only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
when: (1) As provided in section 5.a.2. of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix the product is a hot-process smoked or smoke-flavored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, is vacuum-packed or modified atmosphere-packed, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contains at least 3.5 percent water-phase salt in the finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, or 3.0 percent salt and 100 to 200 ppm of sodium nitrite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the finished product (section 4.a.1. of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix); (2) as provided in section 5.a.4. of Example 6 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this appendix, the product is a cold-process smoked or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke-flavored product, is vacuum-packed or modified atmosphere- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packed, and contains at least 3.5 percent water-phase salt in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product or 3.0 percent salt and 100 to 200 ppm of sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nitrite. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is providing in Appendix C, section 8.a. that all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaging should be conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the processing plant where the product is manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Ref. 180). FDA considers this limitation appropriate to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any postprocessing contamination of the product from bacterial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogens and to ensure that the fish will be packaged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately after processing to protect its overall quality. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Process monitoring.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 7 of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix, the agency is recommending specifications for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature indicating and recording devices where they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended elsewhere in this appendix. These proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications are the same as those proposed in Appendix A for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooked, ready-to-eat fishery products (Appendix A, section 7). A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
full discussion of these controls is provided in section VII.J.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the preamble to this document. Temperature indicating and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recording devices are specifically recommended in section 5.j. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 5.k. of Example 6 of this appendix for the control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking temperature. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At section 5.b. of Example 6 of this appendix, the agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommending specific controls to ensure that the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water-phase salt and sodium nitrate levels are achieved. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significance of these attributes has already been discussed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this document. In section 5.b. of Example 6 of this appendix, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency recommends that a processor perform or obtain a study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that shows that under certain processing conditions the desired 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water phase salt or sodium nitrite level will reliably be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieved. The processor should monitor those processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions identified by the study as having an impact on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ability of the product to achieve the desired level. The study 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should provide critical limits for each of the relevant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing conditions (e.g. maximum fish size, minimum soak time, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum salt to product ratio). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the existence of numerous variables that affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ability of fish to uniformly take up salt and sodium nitrite, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it may be appropriate for a processor to perform periodic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product water phase salt or sodium nitrite analyses as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification step. The purpose of such analyses would be to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify any variables that have an impact on salt or nitrite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absorption that were not identified by the study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Corrective actions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 At section 9 of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix, the agency is recommending corrective action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. These proposed procedures are the same as those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the cooked, ready-to-eat section of this document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Appendix A, section 8). A full discussion of the procedures is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in section VII.J.5 of the preamble to this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Sanitary zones.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 At section 10 of Example 6 of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appendix, the agency is recommending the institution of sanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zones. This proposed control procedure is the same as that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the cooked, ready-to-eat section of this document 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Appendix A, section 9). A full discussion of the control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure is provided in section VII.J.6 of the preamble to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To further ensure the safety of the product during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution and storage, FDA is considering adopting specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
package labeling requirements for smoked and smoke-flavored fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products to reduce the opportunity of temperature abuse of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product. The agency requests comments on whether it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should require that the label of all shipping containers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retail packages state that the product is perishable, and, more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically, that the product must be kept refrigerated. FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tentatively finds that such labeling is extremely important to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring the safe handling of these products, and, therefore, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers it likely that it will require this labeling in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule. The agency requests comment on whether it should do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so. The agency also requests comment on whether, if it decides 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require such a label statement, the statement should specify a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature at which the product should be refrigerated (e.g. 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below). The agency is also considering requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the label of all frozen smoked products state that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product must remain frozen, that if the product needs to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thawed, it must be thawed at refrigerated temperatures, and that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product must not be refrozen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has authority to adopt these labeling requirements under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 201(n), 403(a), and 701(a) of the act because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections require the inclusion of facts on the food label that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are material with respect to consequences that may result from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the product under conditions of use prescribed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
label or that are otherwise customary or usual. The agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments on whether it is necessary to do so.

Hazard Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Fish and molluscan shellfish may be harvested from waters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are exposed to varying amounts of environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants. Industrial chemicals, pesticides, and many toxic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements may accumulate in fish at levels that can cause public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health problems. Concern for these contaminants primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focuses on fish and shellfish harvested from fresh water, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estuaries, and near-coastal waters rather than from the open 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ocean. Pesticides and herbicides used near aquaculture 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations or for other purposes may contaminate fish and fishery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal tolerances or action levels are established for some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the most toxic and persistent contaminants that are found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and fishery products shipped in interstate commerce. (These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants and their corresponding limits are listed below.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When products exceed these limits, FDA can seize the contaminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish and fishery products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States often use the limits for deciding whether to issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption advisories or to close or classify waters for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
harvesting. Molluscan shellfish waters are controlled by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State Shellfish Control Agency (SSCA) or the equivalent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foreign countries that have Memoranda of Understanding with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States that permit them to export molluscan shellfish to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this country. If local or regional contaminants are not covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by federal limits, contact local health departments to decide if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminant levels in fish and fishery products are of public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The control measures provided in this section are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for the control of methyl mercury contamination in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish, where such contamination is the result of industrial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination in a harvest area. Recommended controls for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem of open ocean species, such as swordfish and shark, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrating methyl mercury from their diet and its diffuse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence in the environment are provided in the ``Mercury'' hazard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section.

Critical Control Point: Receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
There are five options for control at this critical control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Option 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Where the firm receives wild caught fish, other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
molluscan shellfish, directly from the fisher or from a supplier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that has credible knowledge of the harvest area location (e.g., a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tender or related company that pools fish from various fishers), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following applies:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Control Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Find out the harvest area location for each lot or batch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the fisher upon receipt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Find out whether the harvest area is closed to fishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by foreign, Federal, State or local health authorities due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The samples are analyzed for pesticides, PCB's, dioxins, and petrochemicals. Either ABC Fish Co. representatives
visit each pond to assess the potential for ongoing chemical contamination, or information is obtained from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture Extension Service about the use of pesticides and herbicides near each pond. Where there
is a potential for pond contamination, annual samples are collected and analyzed for the same contaminants. Fish
that come from contaminated or suspect ponds are rejected.

Control Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Periodically monitor the incoming fish for environmentally persistent organochlorine pesticides which have
the potential to be present in the fish. These should include, but are not limited to: DDT and its degradation products
(DDE, TDE), chlordane, and heptachlor, also similar chlorinated industrial chemicals, such as PCB's and dioxins.
Sampling should represent all suppliers (i.e., three samples per supplier per year).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Reject all shipments from suppliers that provide fish that exceed the critical limits unless convincing evidence
can be obtained that only acceptable harvest or growing areas are now being used.

ABC Fish Co. receives brown shrimp from an interstate seafood transportation company. The carrier, which buys the
shrimp directly from the fishers, makes no effort to learn the harvest location. ABC Fish Co. collects three samples
per supplier per year and sends them to a contract laboratory for pesticide screening. When positive test results
are obtained, the firm stops using that supplier.

containers and held

refrigerated. Pasteurization is a process applied to a fish or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishery product after that fish or fishery product has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
placed in a final, hermetically sealed package. The process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involves the application of sufficient heat (or other processes) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a sufficient time to cause the reduction of microorganisms of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health concern to levels that, under normal conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage, are unlikely to cause disease.

produce toxin at temperatures as low as 3.3 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (38 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F), and must, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, be eliminated from the hermetically sealed container 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the pasteurization process. Pasteurized products that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored, distributed, and displayed in the frozen state, and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so labeled, are not similarly at risk, and need not be subjected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the constraints of these control measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For there to be assurance that the pasteurization step 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively eliminates the microorganisms of public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significance (e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 type E), a minimum acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process should be scientifically established. This requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expert knowledge of thermal process calculations. Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in establishing the minimum thermal process should be those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are generally recognized and accepted. Sometimes, thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
death time, heat penetration, and inoculated pack studies will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to establish the minimum process. In other instances, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing literature is sufficient to provide the processor with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimum process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In either case, characteristics of the process and/or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product will necessarily affect the ability of the cook step to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively eliminate the microorganisms of public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significance. Such factors should be considered in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishment of the process. Where control of those factors is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to consistently achieve that goal, the process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authority should specify these to the processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is necessary that the pasteurizing equipment be designed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and operated so that every unit of product receives the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established minimum process. This will require that a competent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process authority, who is thoroughly familiar with the dynamics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of heat transfer in processing equipment, evaluate the design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the type of equipment used by the processor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sometimes temperature distribution studies will be necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish the adequacy of the equipment. In other instances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing literature will be sufficient to establish the adequacy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the equipment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical Control Point: Pasteurization Control Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Make sure that the pasteurization process that is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used was designed to ensure an appropriate reduction in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers of viable microorganisms of public health concern. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequacy of the pasteurization process should be established by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process authority. The pasteurization process that is being used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should meet any factors of the process or of the product that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified by the process authority as critical to achieving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathogen destruction. At a minimum, these critical factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should include pasteurizing times and temperatures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Make sure that the pasteurization equipment being used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is properly designed and operated to deliver the process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established by the process authority. The engineering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications of the equipment being used (e.g., pipe sizes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flow rates, loading pattern) should meet or exceed that of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment evaluated by a process authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Deliver the pasteurization process in a way that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no deviation from the minimum established pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Monitor the pasteurization temperature with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature recording device (i.e., temperature recorder). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature recorder should be installed where it can be easily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
read and the sensor for the device should be installed to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it accurately measures the coldest temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurizing equipment. The temperature recorder must show a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuous record of the process. Computerized storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature data may be used for a temperature recorder chart if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of such a system has been validated and can be shown to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be equivalent to the use of a temperature recorder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Check the accuracy of each temperature recorder at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning and end of each production day and adjust it as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to agree as nearly as possible with a temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating device (mercury-in-glass thermometer or equivalent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device). The thermometer should be installed where it can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
easily read and placed to ensure that it accurately measures the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coldest temperature of the pasteurizing equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Calibrate the thermometer at the pasteurizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature against an accurate standard thermometer. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be done when the thermometer is installed and at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
once a year after that, or more frequently, if necessary, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure its accuracy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Monitor the length of the pasteurization cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Monitor other critical factors (e.g., initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature, container size, product formulation) at the start of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each shift or when the product changes during a shift. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The ABC Crab Co. produces pasteurized crabmeat. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pasteurization process being used has been established by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the university extension service (a process authority). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process provided by the extension service includes limits on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how to stack the canned product into the pasteurizer, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process temperature, and the length of time needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve proper pasteurization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pasteurization equipment being used by ABC Crab Co. is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least equivalent to that described by the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received from the extension service. It is equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both a mercury-in-glass thermometer and a recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermometer. The recording thermometer is compared to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mercury-in-glass thermometer during each pasteurization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cycle. It is adjusted as necessary to meet the critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit. The mercury-in-glass thermometer is calibrated at an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent laboratory every 6 months. The temperature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each pasteurization cycle is controlled to meet the critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits using the mercury-in-glass thermometer and the length 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of each cycle is controlled using a wall clock. The loading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the cans is checked before starting each batch.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
When there has been a failure to maintain appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature, time, or other critical factors of the process or of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product, within the critical limits, the affected product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;destroyed; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;reprocessed to eliminate the hazard, keeping full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records of the processing conditions; or, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;segregated and held until an evaluation can be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to determine the effect of a deviation. The evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be made by a process authority following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized procedures. Unless the evaluation shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the product has received adequate pasteurization, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product should be destroyed or reprocessed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminate the hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Indicating or recording thermometers that cannot be adjusted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to within the critical limits should be repaired or replaced. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermometer that has a divided fluid column should be immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repaired or replaced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any critical limit deviation should cause a timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment by management to: Learn whether the process or HACCP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan needs changing to reduce the risk of recurrence of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deviation, and take appropriate followup action.

1. General guidance for smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This section provides consolidated guidance on how to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements of subpart A of 21 CFR part 123, for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing of smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance involves processing procedures for the control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
microbiological hazards to which these products are particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
susceptible. The guidance does not apply to finnan haddie, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoked cod fillets, smoked scotch kippers, or other smoked fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are cooked before being consumed, because these products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be heated to destroy any potential toxins or pathogens. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidance also does not apply to smoked fishery products that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
packaged in hermetically sealed containers, processed to destroy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spores of nonproteolytic 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
C. botulinum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
types B, E, and F, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored and distributed refrigerated, in the same container. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These products are covered by Appendix A relating to Cooked, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ready-to-Eat fishery products. In addition, the guidance does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not cover environmental or other hazards that might occur before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processor takes possession of its product or raw materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Guidance on these hazards may be found in a separate guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
document for all fish and fishery products issued by FDA.)

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Products covered by this guidance should be subjected to one of the following processes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Hot-process smoked or hot-process smoke-flavored fish to be air packaged needs to be heated to a continuous internal
temperature of at least 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (63 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) throughout each fish for a minimum of 30 minutes, and brined to contain not less than 3.0 percent water-phase
salt in the finished product (except that smoked chub containing sodium nitrite as provided for in &sect;172.177
of this chapter must be processed as described in that section); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Hot-process smoked or hot-process smoked-flavored fish to be vacuum packaged, modified atmosphere packaged,
or controlled atmosphere packaged, needs to be heated to a continuous internal temperature of at least 145 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (63 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) throughout each fish for a minimum of 30 minutes. It also needs to be brined to contain not less than 3.5 percent
water-phase salt in the finished product. However, where sodium nitrite is present at not less than 100 parts per million
(as permitted by &sect;&sect;172.175 and 172.177 of this chapter) the water-phase salt content in the finished product
should not be less than 3.0 percent; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Cold-process smoked fish and cold-process smoke-flavored fish to be air-packaged should be brined or dry salted
to contain at least 3.5 percent water-phase salt in the finished product. However, when such fish contains not less
than 100 parts per million sodium nitrite, it should contain not less than 3.0 percent water-phase salt in the finished
product. When cold-process smoked fish or cold-process smoked-flavored fish to be air-packaged is frozen immediately
after smoking and cooling, and remains frozen throughout subsequent storage and distribution, it should contain
not less than 2.5 percent water-phase salt in the finished product. Cold smoked and cold smoke-flavored fish to be
air packaged should be processed under one of the following sets of conditions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The temperature in the smoking chamber does not exceed 90 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (32 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) during a drying and smoking period that does not exceed 20 hours, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The temperature in the smoking chamber does not exceed 50 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (10 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) during a drying and smoking period that does not exceed 24 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For sablefish, the temperature in the smoking chamber does not exceed 120 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (49 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) during a drying and smoking period that does not exceed 6 hours; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Cold-process smoked fish and cold-process smoke-flavored fish, to be vacuum packaged, modified atmosphere
packaged, or controlled atmosphere packaged should be brined to contain at least 3.0 percent water-phase salt in
the finished product and not less than 100 parts per million of sodium nitrite (where permitted by &sect;&sect;172.175
and 172.177 of this chapter) and should be processed as described in section 5(a)(3)(i) or (a)(3)(ii) of this Appendix.
If sodium nitrite is not used, the water-phase salt content in the finished product should be at least 3.5 percent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Brining and dry salting operations should be conducted in a manner that will consistently result in the water phase
salt content or sodium nitrite level (where permitted by &sect;&sect;172.175 and 172.177 of this chapter) recommended
by section 5.a. of this Appendix. This should be achieved by conducting or obtaining a study that establishes that
the appropriate salt content or sodium nitrite level is always met under prescribed processing conditions. The study
should establish the limits of significant variables that could affect the ability of the product to reach the appropriate
levels. These variables may include product size, product condition, soak time, soak temperature, salt-to-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water ratio, and product-to-brine ratio. An adequate study should consist of at least three processing runs under
the prescribed processing conditions. In this case, the processor should monitor and record the prescribed processing
conditions identified by the study at least every 2 hours. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The brining of all fish should take place in a refrigerated area at 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The temperature of the brine should not exceed 60 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (15.6 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) at the start of brining. The temperature of the brine at the start of the each brining process should be determined
and recorded.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
e. For dry salting, the fish should be returned to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refrigerated area of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or lower immediately after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the application of the salt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Different species of fish and fish of dissimilar size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and weight should not be mixed in the same brining tank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Brines should not be reused unless they are subject to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process that effectively returns them to a microbiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition equivalent to the original, unused brine made with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potable water and food-grade salt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. Fish may be rinsed with potable water after brining. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Drying of a product to be cold-smoked should be carried 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out in a refrigerated area at 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. Smoking operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Fish should be arranged without overcrowding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without touching each other within the smokehouse oven or chamber 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to permit uniform smoke absorption, heat exposure, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dehydration. Fish smoked in the same smoke chamber load should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be of relatively uniform size and weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Liquid smoke, generated smoke, or a combination of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liquid smoke and generated smoke needs to be applied to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surfaces of the product. Liquid smoke may be applied to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product before, at the beginning, or during the process. If only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated smoke is to be used, it needs to be applied to the fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the first half of the process. If a combination of liquid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoke and generated smoke is used, the generated smoke may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applied at any stage of the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Each smoking chamber should be equipped with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature recording device to indicate the temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
air and of the fish within the smoking chamber. Additionally, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each chamber should be equipped with a temperature indicating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device to indicate the temperature of the air within the smoking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chamber. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
l. During hot-smoking or cold-smoking, a temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recording device should be used to monitor both the internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the fish and the ambient temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking chamber. The internal temperature readings should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained by inserting probes from the temperature recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device into the thickest flesh portion of three or more of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largest fish in the smoking chamber. The temperature from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
slowest heating fish should be considered the processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Cooling after smoking. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
After smoking, the product needs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be rapidly cooled to minimize recontamination. Continuous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling from 140 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (60 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) to achieve an internal temperature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (21.1 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below within 2 hours and an internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below within an additional 4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours, unless processing after smoking as described in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.b. of this Appendix, occurs during either of these time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods, will effectively minimize recontamination. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time/temperature parameters may also be effective. Processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should ensure that the cooling parameters are met by either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Conducting or obtaining a study that establishes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate cooling temperatures are always met under prescribed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing conditions. The study should establish the limits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant variables that could affect the rate of cooling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These variables may include product size, ambient air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature, and amount of product in the cooler. An adequate

b. Processing after smoking. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Products that will receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing after smoking should not be exposed to ambient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperatures of 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or higher for longer than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cumulative total of 4 hours after smoking. If they are exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to such temperatures for more than 4 hours, unacceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recontamination is the likely result. Processors are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regularly monitor and record the length of time that the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is exposed to temperatures above 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F (4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) under 21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
123.8. FDA recommends that such monitoring and recording be done 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least every 2 hours.

Final product cooling. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To avoid microbiological hazards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for perishable finished products, the internal temperature of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. Conduct or obtain a study that establishes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
internal temperature of the finished product will always be 40 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4.4 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C) or below within 4 hours of placement in a finished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product container under prescribed processing conditions. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
study should establish the limits of significant variables that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could affect the rate of cooling. These variables may include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product size, ambient air temperature, and amount of product in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cooler. An adequate study should consist of at least three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processing runs under the prescribed processing conditions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. Monitoring and recording the prescribed processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Units should be equipped with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both a temperature-indicating device and a temperature-recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device. In lieu of a temperature-recording device, a processor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may equip a refrigeration unit with a high temperature alarm or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum-indicating thermometer and maintain a temperature log 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that notes temperature with such frequency as is necessary to

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Where reference is made in this Appendix to temperature-indicating devices and temperature-recording devices,
the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following conditions should apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Temperature-indicating devices
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Temperature-indicating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices should be installed where they can be easily read and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located to ensure that they accurately measure the warmest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the refrigeration equipment and the coldest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature of the smoking equipment, as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Temperature-indicating devices should be calibrated at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routine operating temperature of the refrigeration, cooling, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smoking equipment against a known accurate standard thermometer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon installation and at least once a year thereafter, or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently, if necessary, to ensure their accuracy. Records of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accuracy checks for temperature-indicating devices required to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained under 21 CFR 123.8 should specify the date, standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used, method used, results, and person performing the test. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating device that has a divided fluid column or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that cannot be adjusted to the standard should be immediately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repaired or replaced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Temperature-recording devices
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. Temperature-recording 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices should be installed where they can be easily read and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensors for such devices should be installed to ensure that they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accurately measure the warmest temperature of the refrigeration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment and the coldest temperature of the smoking equipment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as appropriate. Computerized storage of temperature data may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in place of recorder thermometer charts if the use of such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system has been validated and can be shown to be substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent to the use of a temperature-recording device. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-recording device should be checked for accuracy at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the beginning and end of each production day and adjusted as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to agree as nearly as possible with the reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature-indicating device. A record of these accuracy checks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be maintained that specifies the time, date, temperatures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated by both devices before adjustment, corrective action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken, where applicable, and person performing the accuracy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
check. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Packaging 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Vacuum- or modified atmosphere-packaging should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted only within the facilities in which the product is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Permanently legible code marks should be placed on each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finished product package and shipping container. These marks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should identify the plant where the product was packed and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
date of packing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
9. Corrective Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 21 CFR 123.7, whenever a deviation occurs at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical control point, the processor is required to segregate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and hold the product until a review can be made to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect of that deviation and take corrective action as necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products, when a deviation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs at a brining or smoking critical control point, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor should meet the requirements of &sect;123.7 either by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destroying the product; by fully reprocessing, where possible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that portion of the production involved, keeping full records of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reprocessing conditions; or by setting aside that portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the product involved for further evaluation as to any potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health significance. Such an evaluation should be made by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a process authority and should be in accordance with procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized by process authorities as being adequate to detect any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unacceptable hazard to public health. Unless this evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrates that the product had been rendered safe for its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intended use, the product set aside should be either fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reprocessed to correct the deficiency or destroyed. A record 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be made of the evaluation procedures used and the results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Either upon completion of full reprocessing or after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination that no significant public health hazard exists, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that portion of the product involved may be shipped in normal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution. Otherwise, the portion of the product involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be destroyed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Sanitary Zones 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the requirements of 21 CFR 123.10, sanitary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zones should be established around areas in which a smoked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product is handled or stored. In such areas, objects and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees that have come into contact with waste, raw product, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other insanitary objects are excluded. Packaging material, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, employees, and in-process materials that enter a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sanitary zone should be treated in a manner that will minimize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the risk of the introduction of microorganisms. Air handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems should be designed to minimize the risk of airborne 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination into sanitary zones and to provide positive air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure in the sanitary zone relative to the surrounding areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Alternative Parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A processor of smoked or smoke-flavored fishery products may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use parameters other than those provided in Appendix C, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5.a., if those parameters will achieve the following, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrated by adequate scientific studies: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For botulism, zero toxin production in the product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through a time period slightly beyond the shelf life of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product, demonstrated through inoculated pack studies under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal and moderate abuse conditions, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For listeria, no detectable 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Listeria monocytogenes 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final product. A processor using alternative parameters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should have on file, subject to the requirements of 21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
123.8(d), a description, including the results of, the scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
studies.

For purposes of this investigation, certain stainless steel wire rods (SSWR) are products which are hot-rolled or
hot-rolled annealed, and/or pickled rounds, squares, octagons, hexagons or other shapes, in coils. SSWR are made
of alloy steels containing, by weight, 1.2 percent or less of carbon and 10.5 percent or more of chromium, with or without
other elements. These products are only manufactured by hot-rolling, are normally sold in coiled form, and are of
solid cross-section. The majority of SSWR sold in the United States is round in cross-sectional shape, annealed,
and pickled. The most common size is 5.5 millimeters in diameter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SSWR subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheadings 7221.00.0005, 7221.00.0015,
7221.00.0020, 7221.00.0030, 7221.00.0040, 7221.00.0045, 7221.00.0060, 7221.00.0075, 7221.00.0080 of the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs
purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.

which the foreign market value of the merchandise exceeds the United States price for all entries of certain stainless
steel wire rods from Brazil. These antidumping duties will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of certain stainless
steel wire rods from Brazil entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or before August 5, 1993, the
date on which the Department published its preliminary determination notice in the

In its final determination, the Department found that critical circumstances exist with respect to exports of SSWR
from Brazil by Acos Finos Piratini S.A. and Acos Villares S.A. However, on January 21, 1994, the International Trade
Commission (ITC) notified the Department that retroactive assessment of antidumping duties is not necessary to
prevent recurrence of material injury from massive imports over a short period. As a result of the ITC's determination,
pursuant to section 735(c)(3) of the Act, we shall order Customs to terminate the retroactive suspension of liquidation
of entries of subject merchandise exported from Brazil by Piratini and Villares, and to release any bond or other security
and refund any cash deposit required under section 733(e)(2) with respect to all entries of SSWR exported from Brazil
by Piratini and Villares, and entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption prior to August 5, 1993.

Amendment of Final Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 735 (a) and (d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), on December 29, 1993, the Department
of Commerce (the Department) published its final determination that certain stainless steel wire rods from France
were being sold at less than fair value (58 FR 68865). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 5, 1994, Imphy S.A. and Ugine-Savoie (respondent) alleged that the Department made clerical errors in
its final calculations. Respondent argued that the Department erroneously applied best information available
(BIA) to the Metalimphy Alloys Corporation (MAC) and Ugine Stainless and Alloys (US&amp;A) (both divisions of MAC,
which is a subsidiary of Imphy S.A.) further manufactured sales on the basis that the cost of further manufacturing
data did not include costs associated with certain manufactured sales of MAC. Respondent contends that the further
manufacturing costs were fully provided on the C&hyph;1 U.S. sales database under the field ``FURMANU'', which represented
processing charges by outside subcontractors or by Techalloy as the subcontractor. Respondent further states that
the Department accepted this submission, used it for the preliminary determination, made no request for further
information, and appears to have agreed in the final determination that the appropriate information regarding these
sales had been submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not agree that this is a clerical error. The Department required detailed cost information for
further manufacturing to be reported on the E&hyph;2 further manufacturing cost database. Respondent failed to
provide this detailed cost information with respect to products further manufactured by MAC on the E&hyph;2 database,
even though it indicated it had done so on page 2 of the narrative portion of its May 10, 1993, submission. Respondent
reported detailed costs only for products further manufactured by Techalloy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, in its clerical error allegation, respondent indicated that the cost information for products further
manufactured by MAC was included in the ``FURMANU'' field of the C&hyph;1 U.S. sales tape and that the Department used
this for the preliminary determination. First, we agree that the total further manufacturing costs for MAC were included
on the C&hyph;1 U.S. sales tape. However, at the final determination, we made adjustments to certain elements of the
further manufacturing costs. These elements were only included on the E&hyph;2 further manufacturing database.
Since respondent failed to provide on the E&hyph;2 database those cost elements for the products further manufactured
by MAC, the Department could not adjust the further manufacturing costs of the MAC products. Consequently, we also
could not use the costs reported on the C&hyph;1 U.S. sales tape since this tape included only total costs and not the
individual costs elements that we needed to adjust.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondent's argument that the Department used the further manufacturing cost totals on the C&hyph;1 U.S. sales
tape at the preliminary determination is unavailing. At the preliminary determination, the Department used the
further manufacturing totals from the C&hyph;1 sales tape only because respondent did not provide a means to link
the C&hyph;1 and E&hyph;2 tapes in time for the preliminary determination. Since there was no way to link these tapes
(until after the preliminary determination, when we received new tapes in response to the Department's request),
and since the total product further manufacturing costs were the same on both the E&hyph;2 and C&hyph;1 databases,
we simply used the total cost figures on the C&hyph;1 database. This was not the case at the final determination, where
a way to link these tapes was available and where we had to adjust certain cost elements on the E&hyph;2 database. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 10, 1994, petitioners alleged that the Department made three clerical errors in the final determination.
First, petitioners alleged that the Department miscalculated the test which ensures that selling, general and administrative
(SG&amp;A) expenses are not less than ten percent of the cost of manufacture (COM). Specifically, petitioners stated
that the Department's instructions require COM to be multiplied by one percent and not ten percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We agree that this error is a clerical error. In attempting to make sure that SG&amp;A expenses were not less than ten
percent of the COM, we mistakenly multiplied the COM by one percent instead of ten percent. Therefore, we corrected
this error by multiplying the COM by ten percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondly, petitioners alleged that the Department failed to include United States commissions in the value-added
tax (VAT) readjustment calculation, pursuant to which we made a deduction from foreign market value for purchase
price comparisons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a review of petitioners' allegation and the Department's new VAT calculation methodology, we have determined
that this was a clerical error. Therefore, we have included commissions in the VAT readjustment calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, petitioners alleged that the Department double counted home market indirect selling expenses when deducting
this expense from foreign market value during comparisons of constructed value to exporter's sales price. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department agrees that the double deduction of indirect selling expenses from foreign market value during comparisons
of constructed value to exporter's sales price was a clerical error. To correct this error, the Department eliminated
the separate variable for indirect selling expenses from the foreign unit price string. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further discussion of these clerical errors, see Memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford dated
January 25, 1994.

FINAL DETERMINATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We determine that welded stainless steel pipe from Malaysia is being, or is likely to be, sold in the United States at
less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). The estimated margins
are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.

Case History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the publication of our affirmative preliminary determination on September 7, 1993 (58 FR 47120), the following
events have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 7, 1993, the sole respondent in this investigation, Kanzen Tetsu Sdn. Bhd. (KT), requested a postponement
of the final determination. We granted this request, and on September 9, 1993, we postponed the final determination
until not later than January 21, 1994 (58 FR 48849, September 20, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 13, 1993, KT submitted a response to the Department's cost of production (COP) questionnaire. On September
27, 1993, we issued a supplemental COP questionnaire to KT. We received the response to this questionnaire on October
25, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From November 8 through November 12, 1993, we conducted our verification in Malaysia of KT's responses to the Department's
sales questionnaires. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 8, 1993, petitioners submitted a letter requesting that the Department reject KT's October 25, 1993,
COP response because KT failed to report product-specific production costs, as requested in the cost questionnaire.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 10, 1993, KT responded to petitioners' November 8, 1993, submission. Also on November 10 we informed KT
that we had determined that the cost of manufacture (COM) information contained in the October 25, 1993, submission
was not adequately product-specific to meet the Department's requirements, and that, accordingly, we would not
verify that portion of the October 25, 1993, submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From November 22 through November 25, 1993, we conducted our verification in Malaysia of KT's response to the Department's
September 13, 1993, COP questionnaire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both petitioners and respondent filed case briefs on December 20, 1993, and rebuttal briefs on December 28, 1993.

On December 23, 1993, KT submitted revised sales, COP, constructed value (CV), and concordance databases, correcting
minor errors discovered at verification. On January 5, 1994, petitioners submitted a letter requesting that the
Department reject this submission because it contained revisions to KT's data which were unsupported by the record
of this investigation. On January 7, 1994, KT replaced its COP, CV, and concordance databases in order to correct clerical
errors made in its December 23, 1993, submission. We reviewed this submission and confirmed that it contained no new
information.

Scope of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The product covered by this investigation is welded austenitic stainless steel pipe of circular cross section (WSSP).
WSSP is produced according to standards and specifications set forth by the American Society for Testing and Materials
(ASTM). The designations for this product include, but are not limited to, ASTM A&hyph;312, ASTM A&hyph;358, ASTM
A&hyph;409, and ASTM A&hyph;778. Welded pipes are generally used as conduits to transmit liquids or gases. The major
applications for WSSP are: Digester lines; blow lines; pharmaceutical lines; petrochemical lines; brewery process
and transport lines; general food processing lines; automotive lines; and paper processing machines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This product is classified under the following Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) subheadings:
7306.40.1000, 7306.40.5005, 7306.40.5015, 7306.40.5045, 7306.40.5060, and 7306.40.5075. These subheadings
are defined to encompass welded stainless steel tube as well as WSSP; however, the only product subject to this investigation
is WSSP. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Period of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The period of investigation (POI) is September 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Such or Similar Comparisons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have determined that the product covered by this investigation comprises a single category of ``such or similar''
merchandise. We made similar merchandise comparisons on the basis of: (1) ASTM or equivalent specification, (2)
grade of steel, (3) nominal size, (4) hot or cold finish, (5) wall thickness schedule, and (6) end finish, as described
in Appendix V of the questionnaire. We made adjustments for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise,
in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Fair Value Comparisons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether sales of WSSP from Malaysia to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared
the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign
Market Value'' sections of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
United States Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold
to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to importation and because exporter's sales price methodology
was not otherwise indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After correcting the data used in our calculations for errors and omissions found at verification, we calculated
purchase price based on packed F.O.B. prices to unrelated customers. In accordance with section 772(d)(2)(A) of
the Act, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, foreign brokerage and handling, ocean
freight, marine insurance, and containerization expenses. Regarding marine insurance, KT paid an insurance premium
plus a commission to one of its marine insurance suppliers. At verification, we found that KT had inconsistently reported
its marine insurance expense for this supplier (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, KT included the commission in one observation yet excluded it in another observation). KT explained that this commission
was an intracompany service fee which its parent company charged KT for holding the group policy with the insurance
company. However, KT could not substantiate at verification that it had properly excluded this commission. As a result,
we resorted to the use of best information available (BIA), in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act. As BIA, we
have made an adverse assumption and increased the amount reported for marine insurance to account for this commission
for all transactions (except those we found at verification to be correct) by the amount of the commission.

Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of WSSP in the home market to serve as a viable basis for calculating
FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of WSSP to the volume of third country sales of the same product, in accordance
with section 773(a)(1)(B) of the Act. KT had a viable home market with respect to sales of WSSP during the POI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in our preliminary determination, the Department initiated an investigation under section 773(b) of the
Act to determine whether KT made home market sales at less than their COP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If over 90 percent of respondent's sales of a given model were at prices above the COP, we did not disregard any below-cost
sales because we determined that the below-cost sales were not made in substantial quantities. If between ten and
90 percent of the sales of a given model were made at prices below the COP, and such sales were made over an extended period
of time, we discarded only the below-cost sales. Where we found that more than 90 percent of respondent's sales were
at prices below the COP, and such sales were over an extended period of time, we disregarded all sales of that model and
calculated FMV based on CV. No evidence was presented to indicate that below-COP prices would permit recovery of all
costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to determine that below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time, we performed the following analysis
on a model-specific basis: (1) If respondent sold a model in only one month of the POI and there were sales in that month
below the COP, or (2) if respondent sold a model during two months or more of the POI and there were sales below the COP
during two or more of those months, then below-cost sales were considered to have been made over an extended period
of time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to determine whether home market prices were below the COP, we calculated the COP based on the sum of the respondent's
cost of materials, fabrication, and general expenses. We corrected the reported COP and CV data for errors and omissions
found at verification. We relied on the submitted COP and CV data, except in the following instances where the costs
were not appropriately quantified or valued: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. We increased KT's general and administrative expenses (G&amp;A) to (1) account for G&amp;A incurred by KT's parent
company because KT was unable to demonstrate that it had included these expenses in its reported G&amp;A, (2) account
for the amortization of pre-operating expenses which were not included in the submission, and (3) adjust for a clerical
error found at verification. (See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the ``Interested Party Comments'' section of this notice.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We increased KT's cost of materials to offset the gain on foreign exchange reported by KT that was related to the acquisition
of machinery used to produce non-subject merchandise. (See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 8.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 773(e)(1)(B)(i) of the Act, we included in CV the greater of respondent's reported general
expenses, adjusted as detailed above, or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the COM. For profit, we used the actual
profit on home market sales because this amount was greater than the statutory minimum of eight percent of COM and general
expenses. See, section 773(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases where we made price-to CV comparisons, we made circumstances-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate,
for bank charges and credit expenses. Regarding credit expenses, KT calculated both home market and U.S. credit expenses
using its respective average short-term interest rates in Malaysian Ringitts during the POI. We recalculated home
market credit expenses using the consolidated short-term interest rate of KT and its parent company, which was based
upon KT and its parent company's borrowings denominated in Malaysian Ringitts. In addition, KT failed to deduct discounts
from the gross unit price in its home market credit calculation. We made the appropriate deductions in our recalculation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding U.S. credit expenses, we recalculated KT's U.S. interest rate using the amounts of all U.S. dollar-denominated
loans stated in U.S. dollars. (See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 13.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) We also recalculated the payment period for each transaction as the time between the date of shipment from KT's factory
and the date of payment by the U.S. customer. (See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 14.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) We then recalculated U.S. credit expenses using the revised interest rate and payment period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In cases where we made price-to price-comparisons, we compared U.S. sales to home market sales made at the same level
of trade, where possible, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.58 (1993). In addition, we disregarded home market sales of
odd-length merchandise because we determined that these sales were made outside the ordinary course of trade. We
also disregarded certain sales to end user customers, because we found at verification that the dates of sale for these
transactions were outside the POI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We adjusted the reported home market data for errors and omissions found at verification. We then calculated FMV based
on packed F.O.B. prices charged to unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions, where appropriate,
for discounts and rebates. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for inland freight. We deducted home market
packing costs and added U.S. packing costs, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56(a)(1) and 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance-of-sale adjustments, where appropriate,

Verification

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we verified information provided the respondent by using standard verification
procedures, including the examination of relevant sales and financial records, and selection of original source
documentation containing relevant sales information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical Circumstances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners allege that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of WSSP from Malaysia. Section
735(a)(3) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determine that there is a reasonable basis to
believe or suspect that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the class or kind of merchandise which is the
subject of the investigation, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise was imported knew or should have known that the exporter
was selling the merchandise which is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) There have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation over
a relatively short period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding a history of dumping, petitioners have argued that the existence of U.S. antidumping orders on WSSP from
Taiwan and Korea is sufficient for the Department to find a history of dumping in this case. However, the Department's
practice in this area is to consider only those orders on subject merchandise from the country under investigation
as sufficient evidence of a history of dumping. Consequently, because there have been no antidumping orders on WSSP
from Malaysia, we find no history of dumping. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether any importer had knowledge of dumping, we normally consider margins of 25 percent or more sufficient
to impute knowledge of dumping under section 735(e)(1)(A) of the Act when USP is based on purchase price. Because the
final dumping margin for KT is less than 25 percent, we do not impute importer knowledge of sales at less than fair value,
under section 735(a)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act. Since the criteria necessary to find the existence of critical circumstances
under section 735(a)(3)(A) are not present, we do not need to determine whether imports of subject merchandise have
been massive over a relatively short period, in accordance with section 735(a)(3)(B) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, we determine that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to imports of WSSP from Malaysia.

Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners argue that KT was unable to substantiate its cost data at verification. As a result, petitioners contend
that these data are unusable and the Department is required to reject KT's cost data completely and base the final determination
on BIA. Petitioners maintain that, under the statute and the Department's regulations, the Department must use BIA
to set antidumping duty margins whenever a respondent ``refuses or is unable to produce information requested in
a timely manner and in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation'' (see, section 776(b)
of the Act). Petitioners further assert that the Department must also use BIA if it is ``unable to verify the accuracy
of the information submitted'' by a respondent (see, section 776(c) of the Act).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to petitioners, the problems that the Department discovered during verification are significant and
pervasive. (See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 2 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 8 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for the specific issues raised by petitioners.) Petitioners contend that, because of the serious nature of the deficiencies
in KT's cost data, the Department cannot, and should not, develop an alternative basis for constructing KT's production
costs. Rather, petitioners argue that the Department should resort to total BIA. In selecting the BIA rate, petitioners
assert that the Department should use the highest rate possible, which is the highest margin contained in the petition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KT argues that the Department is authorized to use BIA if a party ``refuses or is unable to produce information requested
in a timely manner and in the form required,'' or if a party ``significantly impedes an investigation.'' KT asserts
that, in order for these conditions to be satisfied, the Department must have requested the information and the respondent
must have either failed to supply the information or have been unable to comply with the request. Furthermore, KT argues
that, even where the Department has requested information, it is not authorized to use BIA unless it has provided respondent
with a warning and an opportunity to correct any deficiencies. KT asserts that, since it (1) provided all of the information

KT claims that if the Department determines that it is appropriate to use BIA for purposes of the final determination,
it should use a non-punitive, partial BIA, to reallocate KT's fabrication costs. (See,

Comment 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
KT contends that the Department should accept the material costs reported in its September 13, 1993, response. KT
argues that the Department verified that KT accurately reported in this response its actual production quantities
and actual material costs incurred during the POI. According to KT, since the submitted product-specific material
costs are the result of actual material expenses divided by actual production quantities, there is no basis for suspecting
that the reported per unit material costs are incorrect. KT also maintains that its calculation of steel coil costs
on a grade-by-grade basis is appropriate because the cost of the coil did not vary based on gauge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, KT maintains that, contrary to petitioners' assertions, product-specific material costs reported
in its September 13 submission are different from product-specific material costs reported in its October 25 submission
for a legitimate reason_because the methodologies used in each submission were different. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, KT notes that although the weighted-average material expenses decreased slightly between the September
and October responses, the percentage of the five most frequently sold home-market products that were sold at prices
below the cost of production remained exactly the same, regardless of which response's material costs are used. Thus,
KT maintains that the difference between the two submissions in material expenses does not materially affect the
margin calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to petitioners, since KT did not submit actual costs on a product-specific basis, acceptance of its cost
data would be improper and inconsistent with the Department's normal practice. Thus, petitioners contend that KT's
cost submission should be rejected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Moreover, petitioners claim that the calculation methodologies used to prepare KT's September and October responses
were virtually identical. According to petitioners, for both the September and October responses, KT calculated
its material costs by multiplying the average per-kilogram material cost by the nominal weight of the pipe. Petitioners
assert that the nominal weights used for these calculations were identical because KT stated that the nominal weight
of the pipe was determined according to ASTM A&hyph;312 specifications. Thus, petitioners contend that differences
in the materials costs could only arise if KT used different average per kilogram materials costs for its September
and October responses. Petitioners maintain that these per kilogram materials costs are different for no apparent
reason and are therefore suspect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners contend that KT is incorrect in its assertion that the difference in the material costs reported in the
two cost responses is immaterial to whether home market sales were made at prices below KT's cost of production. According
to petitioners, KT's analysis mistakenly assumes that the understatement of its costs can be corrected by merely
using the costs in KT's unverified October response. Consequently, petitioners argue that the Department should
reject both of KT's cost responses and use BIA to establish KT's final dumping margin.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DOC Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree with KT. The Department verified that KT accurately reported its actual material expenses incurred during
the POI. Although the Department noted at verification that KT did not break out material costs between specific dimensions
of pipe within a particular grade for the verified submission, the record indicates that the company incurred the
same per kilogram cost for differing gauges of coil within a particular grade of steel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We find that a comparison of the methodologies used in September and October responses is irrelevant because we only
verified the methodology used in the September response. Prior to verification, we determined that the costs contained
in the October submission were not adequately product-specific to meet the Department's requirements; therefore,
we informed KT that we would not verify the COM portion of that response. Rather, the Department verified the material
costs used in the September submission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the methodologies used to compile the data in the two submissions were different, the costs reported in the
submissions also differed. Therefore, the fact that the September data differed from the October data does not provide
sufficient grounds to reject these costs. Because we verified the reasonableness of the September costs, we have
accepted them for purposes of the final determination.

Comment 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners argue that the Department should reject the cost of production data contained in KT's original cost submission
because the Department was unable to verify the reported fabrication costs. Specifically: (1) The fabrication costs
reported by KT in its September 13, 1993, submission were allocated to cost centers based on budgeted usage rates which
could not be reconciled to KT's actual POI experience; (2) KT's methodology of allocating fabrication costs between
industrial and ornamental pipe yields a result which is inconsistent with its reported production process steps;
and (3) total manufacturing costs for industrial pipe were allocated to each subject product based on the weight of
production rather than machine time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners note that, to the extent the Department resorted to weight-based allocations in a previous case involving
WSSP (see, Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Certain Welded Stainless Steel Pipe from Taiwan (58
FR 53705, November 12, 1992) (WSSP from Taiwan)), that case represents an aberration from the Department's usual
practice and is clearly distinguishable from the facts in the present case. Petitioners maintain that in WSSP from
Taiwan the Department accepted the Taiwanese respondent's allocation because it concluded that the allocation
``did not materially affect the cost calculation because labor and overhead represented a small part of total cost
of production.'' In this case, however, petitioners contend that KT's submitted data demonstrate that fabrication
costs can hardly be considered immaterial in relation to the submitted total cost of production. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, petitioners contend that KT's reliance on WSSP from Taiwan as a basis for claiming that weight-based allocations
are acceptable is misplaced. Alternatively, petitioners assert that the Department accepts allocation methodologies
based on weight only when a respondent affirmatively shows that such allocations make sense in light of the specific
fabrication process for the product under investigation and when allocations based on machine time cannot be performed.
According to petitioners, neither criterion has been satisfied by KT, and thus the Department should reject KT's
weight-based allocations in favor of BIA.

KT disagrees, claiming that the cost verification report clearly indicates that KT accurately reported all direct
labor and factory overhead expenses incurred during the POI. Thus, KT contends that petitioners' claim that the Department
was unable to verify KT's fabrication costs should be dismissed out of hand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KT states that it allocated fabrication costs between industrial and ornamental pipe production based on the actual
staffing for factory laborers, the actual usage of production equipment, the company's actual production experience
and, for variable overhead expenses, budgeted usage rates. According to KT, the difference between fabrication
expenses per kilogram for industrial and ornamental pipe reflects the fact that KT produces more industrial pipe
than ornamental pipe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, KT claims that the Department should accept its submission methodology of allocating fabrication
costs on the basis of weight for three reasons. First, the methodology conforms with the way in which KT calculates
the cost of goods sold in the normal course of business, and there is no evidence on the record that allocating fabrication
expenses on the basis of weight is in fact distortive. Second, during the POI, KT did not track the information needed
to allocate fabrication costs on the basis of machine time. Third, the Department has accepted weight-based allocations
of these costs in past cases involving stainless steel pipe. Accordingly, KT argues that the Department should accept
its allocation of fabrication expenses for purposes of the final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DOC Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At verification, we determined that KT accurately reported its aggregate fabrication costs during the POI. Therefore,
we disagree with petitioners that KT's fabrication costs should be dismissed for purposes of the final determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In cases where machinery or processes were dedicated to the production of specific product types (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 WSSP), KT assigned costs directly to these products without allocation. For example, KT assigned depreciation expenses
on machinery dedicated to the production of WSSP directly to WSSP. Only in cases where KT incurred fabrication costs
common to the production of both subject and non-subject merchandise did KT allocate these costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We recognize that KT's basis for the allocation of these costs to the subject merchandise used budgeted estimates
which KT was unable to reconcile to its actual production experience during the POI. However, we found at verification
that KT did not maintain the level of detailed records in its normal accounting system that permitted such a reconciliation.
Moreover, the Department determined that these estimates are reasonable based on visual inspection of the production
process and analysis of KT's documentation. Contrary to petitioners' assertions, during the POI KT did not maintain
its records at a sufficient level of detail to perform a more product-specific allocation (e.g., records of machine
time, etc.). Accordingly, we find that KT's allocation methodology is reasonable, in light of the specific circumstances
of this case. Thus, we have accepted the use of KT's methodology in this case for purposes of the final determination.

Comment 4:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners argue that KT calculated its production costs on the basis of theoretical production weights that overstate
the weight of finished production, thus artificially lowering its submitted per unit production costs. Therefore,
petitioners contend that the cost data in KT's September 13, 1993, submission is unusable and should be rejected by
the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KT contends that the use of theoretical weights does not affect the accuracy of its submitted production costs. According
to KT, since KT used the same conversion factor for its calculation to convert (1) pipe production stated in feet to
production stated in kilograms, and (2) production cost per kilogram to a production cost per foot, the conversion
factors are uniformly over- or under-stated by the same amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DOC Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with KT. KT's calculation of theoretical production weights overstates the actual weight of production
during the POI. However, as information on the record indicates, this same theoretical production weight was used
to convert the production costs from a per kilogram cost to a per foot cost. Thus, the effect of overstating the weight
of production is offset by the use of the same formula in converting the per kilogram cost back to a per foot cost. Accordingly,
no adjustment is deemed necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 KT contends that it properly reported all expenses associated with management and financial services provided to
KT by its parent as part of its submitted G&amp;A. KT states that fees for these services are charged directly to KT and
are reflected in the management fee amount KT's parent company received from its subsidiaries in FY 1993. According
to KT, because all management fees that are properly allocable to KT are already charged directly to the company, there
is no basis for charging any additional amount to KT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners contend that KT understated its submitted G&amp;A by not including a portion of its parent company's
expenses incurred during 1992. Petitioners argue that, since KT's parent is principally an investment holding company,
all G&amp;A incurred by the parent directly relate to its investment holdings. Petitioners maintain that KT's claim
that all management fees and financial services provided by its parent company to KT are accounted for in its submission
is unverified and unsupported. According to petitioners, the Department has no way of knowing if KT's management
fees were correctly calculated and reported. Additionally, petitioners claim that the Department should increase
KT's submitted G&amp;A by the omitted amortization of pre-operating expenses as noted at verification.

We agree with petitioners. In cases where a parent company is an investment holding company, it is the Department's
practice to allocate a portion of G&amp;A expenses incurred by the parent company to the respondent under the theory
that the parent's G&amp;A expenses are incurred on behalf of the parent's investment holdings. (See, e.g., Final
Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon from Venezuela (58 FR 27524, May 10, 1993).) Since there
is no verified information on the record to support KT's claim that all G&amp;A expenses incurred by KT's parent for
the benefit of KT were already charged to KT and included in the submitted G&amp;A calculation, we adjusted KT's G&amp;A
to include a proportional amount of its parent's administrative costs based on KT's parent's stock ownership of KT.
Additionally, we revised KT's G&amp;A expense computation to include the omitted amortization of pre-operating
expenses as recorded on the company's financial statements, as well as to correct for a clerical error found at verification.

Petitioners claim that the production yields reported by KT are inaccurate and unrealistic and cannot be relied upon
by the Department for its final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KT argues that production yields are irrelevant because the costs used for the final determination are KT's actual
material expenses, not standard costs. Thus, KT maintains that whether or not the production yield used under the
standard cost system is accurate is irrelevant to the Department's analysis.

DOC Position: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The apparent unrealistic production yields appear to be generated from KT's usage of theoretical production weights.
Since this same theoretical weight was used to convert production costs from a unit of weight basis to a unit of length
basis, the effect of the apparent unrealistic yield rate is offset. (See, Comment 4, above.) Therefore, no adjustment
was deemed necessary for the final determination.

Petitioners contend that the stainless steel coil costs KT used in its original response were not consistent with

the coil costs reported by KT in its second cost questionnaire response. Petitioners argue that the Department, therefore,
should reject the stainless steel coil costs reported by KT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KT argues that petitioners' claim that KT reported inconsistent stainless steel costs is incorrect. KT asserts that
petitioners are basing this claim on a comparison of non-comparable figures. Specifically, KT states that the figures
taken from Exhibit 16 of its original cost response are net of all adjustments for work in process, exchange gains,
and scrap expense and revenue, whereas the figures in the second response include these expenses.

We disagree with petitioners. The Department verified the accuracy of the coil costs contained only in the first submission.
(See, the ``Case History'' section of this notice for further discussion.) Thus, any differences between the first
and second responses are irrelevant. Moreover, it is not relevant that the weighted-average material costs reported
in the first submission differ from selected invoices included as exhibits to the cost verification report. Specifically,
the weighted-average prices are based on the entire population of invoices which comprise KT's raw material requisition
values, while the invoices included as verification exhibits are only a selected portion of them. To the extent that
the individual values are not identical, they should differ from the average value.

variance for FY 1993.

Comment 11:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 KT reported an average home market packing labor expense for the POI based on the packing labor expenses incurred during
each month of the period. Petitioners contend that the Department should use the monthly packing labor expenses in
calculating KT's home market packing expenses instead of the POI average. Petitioners assert that the Department's
longstanding policy is to use data that are as sales-specific as possible. According to petitioners, in this case
the most specific data available are the monthly costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KT argues that using monthly packing labor costs would distort KT's per unit packing expenses. KT maintains that it
is appropriate to spread packing labor expenses over the sales quantities during the entire six-month POI because
of fluctuations in monthly sales volumes. KT asserts that this methodology yields a more representative per unit
expense for the POI because packing labor is a fixed cost.

 We agree with KT. Normally, the Department prefers respondents to report transaction-specific expenses under the
theory that individual prices are set to cover individual (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, transaction-specific) costs. In this case, however, the costs are not transaction-specific. Moreover, because
KT's packing labor expenses are fixed, they do not vary by sales volume. Therefore, fluctuations in the monthly sales
volumes create differences in the monthly average expense amounts. Because these fluctuations in sales expenses
are not translated into changes in the per unit prices, they distort the margin calculation. We agree with KT that using
the POI-average minimizes the effect of these fluctuations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we find that the POI average is more representative of KT's per unit packing labor costs. Accordingly,
we have accepted this average for purposes of the final determination.

 Respondent argues that the Department should calculate KT's U.S. credit period using the date of invoice, rather
than date of shipment from the factory. Respondent states that the invoice date is same as the bill of lading date and
is the date on which the merchandise is shipped from Malaysia. Respondent adds that because the bill of lading date
is the date on which the merchandise leaves KT's possession, the Department would be overstating KT's credit expenses
for its U.S. sales if it used an earlier date. However, KT contends that, should the Department find it necessary to
use shipment dates, the Department should use the shipment dates in its October 29, 1993, submission. KT notes that
these data were verified by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners argue that KT's proposed methodology of using bill of lading date in its U.S. credit calculation should

should use the shipment dates submitted by KT on October 29, 1993.

DOC Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with petitioners. As stated in our preliminary determination, it is the Department's practice to calculate
credit expenses using the period between shipment of the merchandise from the factory and payment. (See, e.g., Final
Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon From Venezuela, 58 FR 27522 (May 10, 1993) and Final Determination
of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products From the United Kingdom,
58 FR 6207 (January 27, 1993).) Moreover, we note that using the date of shipment from the factory does not overstate
KT's U.S. credit expense because, contrary to KT's assertion, KT's factory shipment date generally follows the date
of invoicing.

Comment 15:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Petitioners argue that the Department should not make a difference in merchandise (difmer) adjustment in any instance
where such an adjustment would lower KT's FMV. Petitioners base their argument on the fact that the difmer adjustments
are based on KT's cost data which petitioners claim is unreliable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent maintains that the Department should make difmer adjustments in cases where sales of non-identical merchandise
are compared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
DOC Position:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with respondent. Because the Department has relied on KT's COP data, we have used this data to make our difmer
adjustments.

Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation

We are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of all entries of WSSP that are entered, or
withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after September 7, 1993, the date of publication of our affirmative
preliminary determination in the

FMV of the merchandise subject to this investigation exceeds the USP as shown below. This suspension of liquidation
will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows:

Decision: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approved. No instrument of equivalent scientific value to the foreign instrument, for such purposes as these instruments
are intended to be used, was being manufactured in the United States at the time the instruments were ordered. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasons: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each foreign instrument is a conventional transmission electron microscope (CTEM) and is intended for research
or scientific educational uses requiring a CTEM. We know of no CTEM, or any other instrument suited to these purposes,
which was being manufactured in the United States either at the time of order of each instrument or at the time of receipt
of application by the U.S. Customs Service.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this notice is to announce the revised proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for
Standard Security Label for the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile. This proposed FIPS was originally
announced in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 37948) on August 21, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NIST received comments from 28 government and industry organizations in response to the first notice on the proposed
FIPS for Standard Security Label for the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile. While many of the comments
supported the proposed standard, other comments particularly those received from the Department of Defense, recommended
changes to broaden the scope of the standard and make it compatible with other government efforts to develop secure
communications processes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIST has been working with the Department of Defense and other organizations to revise the original proposal and to
develop a common standard for security labels that will meet the needs of the interested parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIST solicits views from the public, manufacturers, and Federal, State and local government users on this revised
proposed standard prior to submission to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revised proposed standard contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning
the applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals
with the technical aspects of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice.
Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications section from the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP),
National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building, room B64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone
(301) 975&hyph;2816.

Explanation:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This standard specifies the security label for the U.S. Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP).
GOSIP security labels carry information used by protocol entities to determine how to handle data communicated between
open systems. Information on a security label can be used to control access, specify protective measures, and determine
additional handling restrictions required by a communications security policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This standard specifies the syntax for the labels and relies on a Computer Security Objects Register (CSOR) to provide
the semantics. The separation of the label syntax from its semantics enables a common label format to support multiple
security policies and facilitate cross-domain communications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the inherent differences in layer functionality the security label defined in this document is expressed both
as an abstract label syntax specification for the OSI Application Layer and an encoding optimized for use at the Network
Layer. The Application and Network Layers are the initial targets of GOSIP security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The label presented here defines security tags that may be combined into tag sets to carry security-related information.
Five basic security tag types allow security information to be represented as bit maps, attribute enumerations,
attribute range selections, hierarchical security levels, or as user-defined data.

Scope:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This standard specifies a security label for GOSIP-complaint implementations. It includes two label specifications,
one suitable for the OSI Application Layer, and the other for the Network Layer. GOSIP will call for the use of this standard
when optional security protocols at these layers require the use of security labels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The specified Standard Security Label (SSL) applies to OSI communications systems handling U.S. Government unclassified
but sensitive data. The SSL shall be used on OSI systems required to label data as indicated in the security chapter
of GOSIP. Although this standard is intended for use on systems handling unclassified information, it could be adopted
by the appropriate authorities for use on systems handling classified information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SSL may be used by OSI protocols to control access, specify protective measures, and indicate handling restrictions
required by a network security policy as registered in a Computer Security Objects Register.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Complying implementations shall be capable of transmitting, receiving, and obtaining information from security
labels based on the specifications in this document.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Implementation Schedule:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This standard becomes effective six months after publication of a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of its approval by the Secretary of Commerce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Waiver Procedure:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may redelegate such authority only to a senior official
designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of title 44, United States Code. Waiver shall be granted only when:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
computer system; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Compliance with a standard would cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator which is not offset by Government-wide
savings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision which explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified, shall
be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; ATTN: FIPS Waiver Decisions, Technology Building, room

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this notice is to announce a proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for Open Document
Architecture (ODA) Raster Document Application Profile (DAP). This proposed standard will enable Federal agencies
to exercise more effective control over the production, management, and use of Government's raster graphics applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed FIPS will adopt the proposed Draft International Standard Profile (pDISP) FOD112 Open Document Architecture
(ODA) Document Application Profile (DAP), ``ODA Raster DAP,'' which specifies the use of a subset of the Open Document
Architecture (ODA) and Interchange Format Standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to the submission of this proposed FIPS to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval, it is essential

3. Explanation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This Federal Information Processing Standard adopts the International Standard Profile (ISP) FOD112 Open Document
Architecture (ODA) Document Application Profile (DAP), ``ODA Raster DAP,'' which specifies the use of a subset of
the Open Document Architecture (ODA) and Interchange Format Standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ODA standard supports the interchange of compound documents containing up to three types of contents: Character
(text), raster graphics, and geometric graphics. Developed by international standards organizations, the ODA
standard specifies rules for describing the logical and layout structures of documents as well as rules for specifying
character, raster graphics, and geometric graphics content of documents, thus providing for the interchange of
complex documents. The ODA standard was developed primarily by the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO/IEC JTC1) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Telecommunication Standardization Sector
(TSS), formerly the Consultative Committee on International Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A DAP is a functional subset of the ODA standard and facilitates the interchange of documents among different document
systems by specifying the constraints on document structure and content according to the rules of the ODA Standard.
The ODA Raster DAP specifies an interchange format suitable for the transfer of structured documents between systems
designed for raster graphics applications. The documents supported by this standard are based on a paradigm of an
electronic engineering drawing, illustration, or other electronic image. Only raster content in an ODA document
is supported by this FIPS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ODA Raster DAP was initially developed by an ad-hoc Continuous Acquisition and Life-Cycle Support (CALS) Tiling
Task Group. CALS, formerly known as the Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistic Support, is a Department of Defense
(DoD) initiative. The ODA Raster DAP was further developed by vendors and users of computer networks/systems participating
in the Open Systems Environment Implementors' Workshop (OIW), and finally harmonized with the International organizations
participating in the Profile Alignment Group for ODA (PAGODA). It has been submitted to ISO/IEC JTC1/Special Group
on Functional Standards (SGFS) for processing of an International Standard Profile (ISP).

9. Applicability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The ODA Raster DAP is available for use by Federal Government agencies when acquiring and developing raster graphics
applications. This FIPS applies to systems processing, generating, and receiving raster graphics images. It specifies
the structure and parameters for describing and interchanging bi-level compressed images as well as tiled raster
images. Each system acquired or developed by Federal agencies shall include appropriate system-to-DAP and DAP-to-system
translators, such that incoming data streams are interpreted correctly and that outgoing data streams are generated
correctly. Use of the standard is independent of the communications used to transfer documents produced by these
applications, that is, this standard may be used within the existing framework of communication protocols.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
10. Specifications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This FIPS adopts all provisions of the FOD112 ODA Raster DAP which is affixed. The document and raster layout specifications
of ISO 8613 that are essential for raster graphics applications apply to the FIPS for ODA Raster DAP. The specifications
for ODA data streams are also defined in ISO 8613 and apply to the FIPS for ODA raster DAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All implementations claiming conformance to this FIPS must adhere to the specific requirements defined in the ``Conformance''
clause of the ODA Raster DAP and to the general rules below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conformance Rules for Data Streams. A conforming data stream shall be syntactically, semantically, and structurally
correct as defined in this standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conformance rules for Generators. A generator which claims conformance to this standard shall create only conforming
data streams which correctly represent the raster graphics image which was input to the generator.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conformance Rules for Receivers. A receiver which claims conformance to this standard shall be capable of reading
and correctly processing any conforming data stream without halting or aborting such that it produces the correct
results.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
11. Implementation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The implementation of this standard involves three areas of consideration: acquisition of raster graphics implementations,
interpretations of the standard, and validation of ODA Raster DAP implementations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
11.1 Acquisition of Raster Graphics Applications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This standard is effective six months after date of publication of final document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For a period of twelve (12) months after the effective date, agencies are permitted to acquire alternative software
that provides equivalent functionality to the ODA Raster DAP. Agencies are encouraged to use this standard for solicitation
proposals for new raster processing systems to be acquired after the effective date. This standard is mandatory for
use in all solicitation proposals for new raster application products acquired twelve (12) months after the effective
date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
11.2. Interpretation of the Standard.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NIST provides for the resolution of questions regarding FIPS for ODA Raster DAP specifications and requirements,
and issues official interpretations as needed. Procedures for interpretations are specified in FIPS PUB 29&hyph;2.
All questions about the interpretation of FIPS for ODA Raster DAP should be addressed to: Computer Systems Laboratory,
ATTN: Raster Graphics Interpretation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
11.3. Validation of ODA Raster DAP Implementations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Validation of ODA Raster DAP implementations is not mandatory at this time. Future versions of this FIPS may mandate
the validation of ODA Raster DAP implementations for government use. Testing of an implementation's conformance
to this FIPS will be optional by the agency. Until a formal conformance testing service is available, government agencies
acquiring implementations in accordance with this standard may wish to require testing for conformance, interoperability,
and performance. The tests to be administered and the testing organization are at the discretion of the government
agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
12. Waivers.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under certain exceptional circumstances, the heads of Federal departments and agencies may approve waivers to Federal
Information Processing Standards (FIPS). The head of such agency may delegate such authority only to a senior official
designated pursuant to section 3506(b) of title 44, U.S. Code. Waivers shall be granted only when:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Compliance with a standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of an operator of a Federal
Computer system, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Cause a major adverse financial impact on the operator that is not offset by Government wide savings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency heads may act upon a written waiver request containing the information detailed above. Agency heads may also
act without a written waiver request when they determine that conditions for meeting the standard cannot be met. Agency
heads may approve waivers only by a written decision that explains the basis on which the agency head made the required
finding(s). A copy of each such decision, with procurement sensitive or classified portions clearly identified,
shall be sent to: National Institute of Standards and Technology; Attn: FIPS Waiver Decision, Technology Building,
Room B&hyph;154; Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, notice of each waiver granted and each delegation of authority to approve waivers shall be sent promptly
to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Government Affairs
of the Senate and shall be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the determination on a waiver applies to the procurement of equipment and/or services, a notice of the waiver
determination must be published in the Commerce Business Daily as a part of the notice of solicitation for offers of
an acquisition or, if the waiver determination is made after that notice is published, by amendment to such notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the waiver, any supporting documents, the document approving the waiver and any supporting and accompanying
documents, with such deletions as the agency is authorized and decides to make under 5 U.S.C. 552(b), shall be part
of the procurement documentation and retained by the agency.

Related On-Line Information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Information on the NIST POSIX Testing Program is available on an electronic mail (Email) file server system. Documents
available are: registers of validated products, general information on NIST POSIX testing policy, and information
on requirements for certificates of validation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To access the system:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You must be able to send and receive Email via the Internet. For most Email systems, send a message to posix@nist.gov.
When the Email system responds with ``Subject'', you may type anything. The next line should be a basic command for
the Email server to send you one or more of the available documents. For example, to receive a listing of all available
files, enter: send index.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After you issue your send command and a carriage return, the next line should signal the end of the Email message as required
by your Email system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your Email system may respond with EOT for the end of transmission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mail server program reads the message and sends the requested document to the requester's Email address.

Objectives.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This FIPS permits Federal departments and agencies to exercise more effective control over the production, management,
and use of the Government's information resources. The primary objectives of this FIPS are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. To promote portability of computer application programs at the source code level.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. To simplify computer program documentation by the use of a standard portable system interface design.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. To reduce staff hours in porting computer programs to different vendor systems and architectures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. To increase portability of acquired skills, resulting in reduced personnel training costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. To maximize the return on investment in generating or purchasing computer programs by insuring operating system
compatibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. To allow people to operate a wide range of application platform implementations without additional training or
study.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government-wide attainment of the above objectives depends upon the widespread availability and use of comprehensive
and precise standard specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This FIPS shall be used for POSIX command language interpreters and utilities that are either developed or acquired
for Government use. This FIPS is applicable to the entire range of computer hardware, including:

Specifications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The specifications for this FIPS are the specifications contained in the Draft International Standard ISO/IEC 9945&hyph;2:1992,
Information Technology_Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part 2: Shell and Utilities, with the modifications
specified below. ISO/IEC 9945&hyph;2:1992 defines a command language interpreter (shell) and a set of utility programs.
ISO/IEC 9945&hyph;2:1992 (hereinafter referred to as POSIX.2) refers to and is a complement to ISO/IEC 9945&hyph;1,
Information Technology_Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part 1: System Application Program Interface
(API) [C Language].
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
POSIX.2 contains a number of features that are labelled obsolescent. These features violate the general syntactic
guidelines of POSIX.2. They were included in POSIX.2 to provide upward compatibility of existing applications,
and may be deleted from POSIX.2 at some future date. The POSIX.2 standard requires that strictly conforming applications
do not use any of these features. It is strongly recommended that agencies that require the POSIX.2 FIPS prohibit users
from using these features. Therefore, the following obsolescent features are not required for a system to be compliant
with the POSIX.2 FIPS. (For each feature a reference to the associated POSIX.2 text is provided):

Users of this standard should be aware that it does not require the Portable Operating System Interfaces (POSIX)_Part
2: Shell and Utilities to be implemented on a FIPS 151&hyph;2 conforming implementation. Users should also be aware
that certain utilities and functions are optional in ISO/IEC 9945&hyph;2:1992. To provide the greatest support
for application portability, it is recommended that an implementation conforming to this FIPS also provide the following
features:

Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that Federal users require Feature 1 and, in addition, ensure that purchased
systems are capable of supporting Features 2&hyph;5, listed above. Even when these features are not needed at the
time of initial purchase, changed requirements may demand some or all of these in the future, either for the development
of new applications, for the importing of applications from other systems, or to maximize compatibility among multiple
in-house systems.

The POSIX Shell and Utilities FIPS is the second component of a series of specifications needed for the operating system
services area of an applications portability profile. FIPS 151&hyph;1 (and its replacement, FIPS 151&hyph;2) provided
the crucial first step by providing a vendor independent interface specification between an application program
and an operating system. When fully extended, POSIX will provide the functionality required to support source code
portability for a wide range of applications across many different machines and operating systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NIST has published Special Publication 500&hyph;210, Application Portability Profile (APP), The U.S. Government's
Open System Environment Profile, OSE/1, Version 2.0, June 1993. The APP has been developed to provide sufficient
functionality to accommodate a broad range of application requirements. The functional components of the APP constitute
a framework for organizing standard elements that can be used to develop and maintain portable applications. A key
aspect of the APP is that it is based on an open system environment defined by non-proprietary specifications. Components
may be added or deleted as technology changes and as Federal government requirements change.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has received a request to establish a laboratory accreditation
program. In a letter dated September 16, 1993, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association, Washington,
DC requested that NIST establish an accreditation program for testing electric motors for energy efficiency (but
not for safety). A copy of the request letter is set out as an appendix to this notice. Announcement of this request by
the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), and of the NIST request for comments with respect thereto,
are being made under the procedures of the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) (15 CFR part
7, subpart B, &sect;7.11(d)) of the referenced Procedures.

Scope of Laboratory Accreditation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The request letter called for accreditation of test laboratories based on standard test methods for performance
of energy efficient electric motors for the proposed program. The accreditation program will assist the efforts
of industry to meet the requirements of the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992 regarding electric motors. The test methods
for accreditation discussed at NEMA and DoE meetings with industry will be for IEEE Standard 112 Test Method B, and
NEMA Standards Publication MG1&hyph;1987, as set forth in the EPACT legislation and other standards when and if the
Secretary (DoE) amends the test procedures. NVLAP Procedures have recently been modified to be fully in accord with
ISO Guide 25 that extends ISO 9002 recognition; such criteria will beneficially impact on the qualified applicants
granted accreditation if approval is made to proceed with the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a normal extension of support by NVLAP to other agencies the applicable requirements of DoE to be established under
the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) would be made an integral part of the program for accreditation of laboratories.

After the 60 days comment period, NIST will thoroughly evaluate all comments pertaining to the proposed accreditation
program. Notification to all interested persons will be made by copy of a FR notice of the decision by the director of
NIST regarding development of this program. Interested persons are the submitters of comments, or those requesting
copy by placement on a NVLAP mailing distribution list. Approval of the program will call for technical assistance
and input from interested and qualified parties and for comments to be made on the program handbook, test methods,
and criteria applied in the program. NVLAP Procedures provide for public comment prior to final publication of the
accreditation requirements.

Dear Dr. Prabhakar: This letter is written on behalf of the Motor and Generator Section of NEMA to request that the National
Institute of Standards and Technology establish a laboratory accreditation program (LAP) for electric motors through
the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the program will be to accredit testing laboratories to certify that standard test methods for product
performance (and not safety) are properly followed in testing electric motors. Standard test methods and related
performance standards will be those developed through such accredited standards-making organizations as NEMA
and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of a NVLAP program on energy efficient motors will be beneficial to industry in meeting the requirements
of the Energy Policy Act (EPACT) of 1992 regarding electric motors. The EPACT requires that certain types and sizes
of electric motors meet minimum efficiency standards and that a program be established to verify the efficiencies.
A NVLAP program will assure that data used to verify motor efficiencies are measured in competent testing laboratories.
The NVLAP program on energy efficient lighting, developed in response to a previous request by NEMA, will serve as
a model for a program on electric motors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NEMA Motor and Generator Section is willing to assist the National Institute of Standards and Technology in identifying
and obtaining the necessary technical resources to establish the accreditation program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Please give this request your immediate attention.

Categories 340/640, 342/642, 347/348, 443 and 447 for the period beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through
December 31, 1994. Guaranteed access levels (GALs) are being established for Categories 340/640, 342/642 347/348

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 15, November 29, and December 10, 1993, the committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely
Disabled published notices (58 FR 60181, 62646 and 64932) of proposed additions to the Procurement List.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide
the commodities and services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors,
the Committee has determined that the commodities and services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal
Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
major factors considered for this certification were:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small
entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities and services to the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and services to the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day
Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement
List. Accordingly, the following commodities and services are hereby added to the Procurement List:

factors considered for this certification were: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than the small organizations that will furnish the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodity and services to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current contractors for the commodity and services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnish the commodity and services to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would

accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodity and services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 22, 1993, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notice (58
FR 54560) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received from the two current contractors for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
folders. One of the commenters enclosed letters in support of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments from three nonprofit agencies employing people with severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabilities which have subcontracts to package folder tabs for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
folders. That commenter indicated that addition of the folders to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Procurement List would have a severe impact on the firm and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees, particularly when other recent Committee actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacting the firm are taken into account. The commenter also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicated that these folders provide most of the work it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcontracts to three agencies employing people with severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabilities which make tabs for use with the folders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the figures available to the Committee, the impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the loss of sales for the folders on this company, together with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the impact of the earlier actions, does not rise to a level which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Committee normally considers severe adverse impact. As for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible loss of employment for the commenter's workers, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee feels that it is outweighed by the creation of jobs for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people with severe disabilities, whose unemployment rates greatly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed those of people without disabilities. In addition, for at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
least the first two years after the JWOD agencies assume supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility, the commenter will be afforded the opportunity to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compete as a supplier of folder tabs to the nonprofit agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which will produce the folders. Thus, any impact on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters and its employees would be mitigated by the opportunity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they will have initially to compete to supply the folder tabs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the three nonprofit agencies which are the commenter's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcontractors for the folder tabs participates in the JWOD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program. According to that agency, its subcontract with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter only recently produced work for its people with severe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabilities, and at very low wages. While the nonprofit agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been led to expect a constant flow of this work, it has no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guarantee that this will occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the JWOD-participating agency's subcontract work volume is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typical of that provided to the other two nonprofit agencies (which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both the JWOD agency and the figure for subcontractor employees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by the commenter suggest it is), the commenter's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government business for these folders is only a portion of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total folder business. Consequently, even if the commenter is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful in competing to supply the folder tabs to the nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies which will produce the folders, addition of these folders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Procurement List should not markedly diminish the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcontract work which would be available to the three nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies employing people with disabilities. Moreover, if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter (or the JWOD-participating subcontractor agency) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful in bidding to supply the folder tabs to the nonprofit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies which will produce the folders, the work for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcontractor agencies could actually increase for at least two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
years since the commenter currently provides less than half of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government requirement for the folders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, it should be noted that the commenter could discontinue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing this work to the nonprofit agencies employing persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with severe disabilities if it chose. The commenter indicated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it would take only a small investment to automate this work. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the other hand, placing the folders on the Procurement List 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guarantees that people with severe disabilities will be involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producing them for the Government. The Committee believes the jobs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its action would create outweigh the possible loss of employment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for employees of the commenter's subcontractors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other commenter also indicated that it was being significantly impacted by this and other recent additions to
the Procurement List. It also provided a small amount of information to 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
substantiate its claim that small businesses like itself are being forced out of the commercial market by large office
products companies. Because of this development, the impact of additions to the Procurement List is magnified as
there are fewer opportunities to recoup losses to the Procurement List in the commercial market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The impact of this and other recent Procurement List additions on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this commenter, as a percentage of the commenter's sales, is less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than half the impact on the first commenter. In the Committee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
view, neither impact rises to the level of severe adverse impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the small impact figure for this commenter, the Committee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not believe that the effect of a shrinking office products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market for small businesses, if such is the case, is significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enough to make the impact on this commenter severe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After consideration of the material presented to it concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commodities, fair market price, and impact of the addition on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the commodities listed below are suitable for procurement by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I certify that the following action will not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors considered for this certification were:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (``CME'') and the Board of Trade Clearing Corporation (``BOTCC'') have submitted
to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') a proposal to establish a common banking and settlement
system, pursuant to Section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act''), 7 U.S.C. 7a(a)(12)(A), and Commission
Regulation 1.41(b), 17 CFR 1.41(b) (CME and BOTCC together being the ``participating clearing organizations'').
The proposal requires that participants be limited to entities that are themselves members of both the CME and BOTCC
(``joint clearing members''), and provides for computing and transferring performance bond margin, settlement
variation, and option premiums in respect of commodity futures and options contracts of such joint clearing members.
The proposal also includes procedures governing the distribution of excess performance bond margin deposits between
the CME and BOTCC in certain cases of suspension or expulsion of joint clearing members.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the common banking and settlement procedures provide for performance bond margin deposited by joint clearing members
to be held in the joint names of the participating clearing organizations at one or more depositories; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the common banking and settlement procedures provide for the netting of daily settlement variation and option premium
payments that joint clearing members pay to or receive from the participating clearing organizations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the common banking and settlement procedures can be used to reallocate cash performance bond margin deposits of joint
clearing members between the participating clearing organizations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
it is not intended that the common banking and settlement procedures result in a novation of the joint clearing members'
obligations to either of the participating clearing organizations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in the event of the suspension or expulsion of a joint clearing member, the common banking and settlement procedures
prohibit any excess performance bond margin, or proceeds thereof, attributable to customer origin positions from
being transferred between the CME and the BOTCC to satisfy any deficit or unsatisfied settlement obligations attributable
to proprietary origin positions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
by letter dated September 29, 1993, the participating clearing organizations acknowledge that, in the event of the
suspension or expulsion of a joint clearing member, the common banking and settlement procedures would permit the
transfer of any excess performance bond margin, or proceeds thereof, between the CME and the BOTCC only if there was
no shortfall in the funds required to meet the joint clearing member's customer segregated funds requirements for
all of its customers, and, by letter dated December 13, 1993, the participating clearing organizations acknowledge
that the proposed agreement among the joint clearing members and the participating clearing organizations is expressly
subject to the terms of this Order; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
by letter dated December 9, 1993, the participating clearing organizations have represented that, before implementation
of the proposal, the agreement between the participating clearing organizations will be amended to make clear that,
in the event of a default by a joint clearing member, the clearing organization at which the default occurred will transfer
funds to the other clearing organization in accordance with its respective gross payment obligations if there is
a deficit in payment flows to the other clearing organization resulting from the netting of payment obligations pursuant
to the common banking and settlement procedures, and will otherwise satisfy its gross payment obligations to non-defaulting
joint clearing members in accordance with the routine settlement schedule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the proposal requires that participants be limited to entities that are themselves members of both the CME and BOTCC
and does not permit participation by affiliated entities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Whereas, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the Commission has reviewed the common banking and settlement proposal, the proposed agreement between the participating
clearing organizations, the proposed agreement among the joint clearing members and the participating clearing
organizations, the representations of the participating clearing organizations as to the operation of the common
banking and settlement system, and such other documents as constitute the complete record in this matter (``Record'');

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Now Therefore, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
based on the Record in this matter, and provided that the common banking and settlement proposal submitted by the CME
and the BOTCC is implemented consistently with the representations and agreements cited herein; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is Hereby Ordered, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Sections 4d and 20 of the Act, 7 U.S.C. 6d and 24, and consistent with the Bankruptcy Code, that, in the event
of the suspension or expulsion of a joint clearing member by both the CME and the BOTCC, the clearing organization to
which performance bond margin has been allocated may transfer any excess performance bond margin, or proceeds thereof,
to the other clearing organization only if there is no shortfall in the funds required to meet the joint clearing member's
customer segregated funds requirements for all of its customers for whom segregation must be maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is Further Ordered, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 5a(a)(12)(A) of the Act that the CME and the BOTCC's request for Commission approval of their proposal
to establish a common banking and settlement system, including approval of proposed CME Rule 802, proposed amendments
to CME Rule 832, proposed BOTCC Bylaws 118, 119, and 517, and proposed amendments to BOTCC Bylaws 503, 508, 604, and
804 is hereby granted.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Public Law 101&hyph;510, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, the Defense Base
Closure and Realignment Commission recommended the closure of Sacramento Army Depot and transfer of depot missions
to other installations/agencies. Maintenance missions would be competed to determine location of transfer. In
accordance with the Act, the Secretary of Defense must implement all recommendations for closure or realignment.
Subject document focuses on the environmental and socioeconomic impacts and mitigations associated with the disposal
and reuse of Sacramento Army Depot.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No long-term adverse ecological or environmental health effects are expected due to this action. The increase in
population anticipated by the reuse and disposal activities is expected to have a net positive impact on the local
economy. The preferred alternative, prepared with the cooperation of the local community, is not expected to significantly
impact environmental resources.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No fees will be charged for entrance to any Corps operated area. Fees will be charged for the use of developed day use
recreation facilities provided by the Corps, as prescribed below and shown in Appendix C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Day user fees will be charged for the use of Corps operated day use facilities which meet the requirements described
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Fees will be charged for the use of certain boat launching ramps and designated, developed swimming beaches in
Corps operated day use recreation areas. Fees will not be charged for drinking water, wayside exhibits, roads, scenic
drives, overlook sites, picnic tables, toilet facilities, surface water areas, undeveloped or lightly developed
shoreland, or general visitor information. Day user fees will not be charged for the use of visitor centers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Day user fees will be charged only where there is reasonable expectation that revenues will significantly exceed
costs of collection, to include implementation costs. Estimates of annual revenue from a fee facility must exceed
annual estimated cost to collect, including the cost of implementation amortized over the design life of the improvements,
by 10% or $3,000, whichever is greater. The estimate should be reviewed periodically by Division Commanders to determine
the justification for modifying the project fee collection program.

Boat Launch User Fee. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A day user fee of $2.00 will be charged to launch a boat at a ramp in a Corps operated day use recreation area, provided
that the net revenue test in paragraph 5.a.(2) is met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fee will be charged at recreation areas having a boat ramp and one or more of the following facilities: restrooms,
security lighting, picnicking facilities, swimming facilities, or other developed recreation facilities. The
boat launch fee will not be charged at boat ramps located in recreation areas which are exclusively campgrounds and
reserved exclusively for the use of campers, or in recreation areas which provide only a boat ramp and courtesy dock.

Swimming Beach User Fee. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A day user fee of $1.00 per person, up to $3.00 per vehicle, will be charged for the use of a designated, developed swimming
beach in a Corps operated day use recreation area, provided that the net revenue test in paragraph 5.a.(2) is met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The swimming beach fee will be charged at Corps operated, designated, developed swimming beaches, with the exception
of swimming beaches located in recreation areas which are exclusively campgrounds and reserved exclusively for
the use of campers. A designated, developed swimming beach is properly signed, buoyed and delineated in accordance
with established design and safety requirements contained in EM 1110&hyph;1&hyph;400.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Payment of this fee entitles the user to use any developed beach at any Corps operated recreation area at any Corps
project on that day, with the exception of swimming beaches located within fee campgrounds and reserved exclusively
for the use of campers.

Daily User Fee Exclusivity. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The daily boat launch ramp and swimming beach user fees are mutually exclusive. Payment of a daily boat launch ramp
user fee does not permit swimming at a designated beach, and vice versa.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Annual Day User Fee Pass. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An annual pass may be purchased for $25.00, which permits the holder and all accompanying passengers in the vehicle
to use any or all boat launch ramps and/or designated, developed swimming beaches at any Corps operated recreation
area at any Corps project for that calendar year, except at facilities located within a fee campground and reserved
exclusively for the use of campers. A sample annual pass is shown in Appendix D.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paid Camping Permits. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A paid camping permit will entitle the holder to use any or all day use facilities without paying additional day user
fees at the same project, on any day for which the permit is valid. In certain instances, some form of vehicle pass may
be required for campers who have more than one vehicle or where the camping unit is also the mode of transportation.
A separate pass, locally printed for this situation, is acceptable. Resource managers should consider local situations
when determining applicability.

Lessees may not charge a fee for Corps operated facilities. They may charge, however, for Corps constructed facilities
located on their leasehold in accordance with real estate policy, prescribed in CERE&hyph;MC memorandum, dated
15 Oct 1993, Subject: Fees Charged at Leased Recreation Sites.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The district commander will provide the established schedule of day user fees to the major subordinate command
NLT 30 December each year, beginning in 1994. The major subordinate command commander will periodically review/audit
the district's establishment of fee schedules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Information on approved user fee areas and charges will be submitted through the National Resource Management
System (NRMS), as outlined in ER 1130&hyph;2&hyph;414.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Cost of Collection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since day user fees will be collected only at facilities where revenue significantly exceeds cost of collection,
strict attention must be given to tracking costs associated with the collection of day user fees at designated facilities.
An annual analysis of revenues versus cost of collection, including amortized implementation costs, must be available
for review by Major Subordinate Commands and by HQUSACE by 30 December of each year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effective Dates for Fee Collection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
District commanders will assess seasonal visitation patterns of individual fee areas to determine the period during
which a fee program will be in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Signs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All areas designated as recreation user fee areas will be marked with appropriate signs that provide necessary instructions
to users of the area with regard to collection of fees. The official U.S. fee area symbol will be displayed at the entrance
to designated user fee areas. The U.S. fee area symbol will be installed prior to collection of fees in the area. All
signs and symbols will conform to the guidance provided in EP 610&hyph;1&hyph;6a and b and ER 1130&hyph;2&hyph;431.

<DOCTITLE>Notice of Intent To Reopen Scoping for a Joint Environmental Impact Statement for Proposed Disposal and Reuse of Long
Beach Naval Hospital, Long Beach, CA</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) as implemented by the Council on Environmental Quality
(CEQ) regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), the Department of the Navy announces its intent to reopen scoping
for an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to evaluate the environmental effects of the disposal and reuse of Naval
Hospital (NAVHOSP) Long Beach, Long Beach, California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with requirements of the 1991 Base Closure and Realignment Commission, the Navy plans to disestablish
NAVHOSP Long Beach on 31 March 1994. Operations conducted at NAVHOSP Long Beach are currently relocating to other
naval hospitals located in the continental United States. The proposed action involves the disposal of land, buildings,
and infrastructure of NAVHOP Long Beach for subsequent reuse. The property currently occupied by the hospital totals
65.2 acres located at 7500 E. Carson Street and generally bounded by Carson Street, Dovey Drive, El Dorado Regional
Park, and the 605 Freeway. However, a parcel of approximately 35 acres will revert to ownership by the City of Long Beach
in accordance with the deed conveying that parcel to the Navy. The disposal and reuse of the remaining approximately
30 acres will comprise the focus of the NEPA documentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Navy intends to analyze the environmental effects of the disposal of NAVHOSP Long Beach based on the reasonably
foreseeable reuse of the property, taking into account uses identified by the City of Long Beach and as determined
during the scoping process. Potential reuses of NAVHOSP Long Beach that have been identified include (1) demolition
of the existing hospital complex and accessory structures and construction of approximately one million square
feet of retail, restaurant, and entertainment commerical space, (2) continued use of the existing hospital complex
for medical use, and (3) use of the existing facilities for educational, office, and administrative spaces.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The City of Long Beach owns the adjacent property to the west of the hospital site and plans to develop it, along with
the property that will revert to City control as soon as possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Major environmental issues that will be addressed in the EIS include, but are not limited to, air quality, water quality,
wetlands, endangered species, cultural resources, transportation, and socioeconomic impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In May 1993, the Navy initiated a scoping process for the purpose of determining the scope of significant issues to
be addressed related to this action. A scoping meeting was held in the City of Long Beach on 27 May 1993 and the process
of preparing the EIS was begun. More recently, however, the Navy has become aware that additional potential reuses
of the hospital site may have been identified that need to be evaluated through the NEPA process. Therefore, the scoping
process is being reopened for a period of 90 days from the date of this notice to allow communities, organizations,
and the public to submit to the Navy additional reuse alternatives or substantive environmental issues of concern.
The Navy will then fully evaluate potential reuse recommendations that have a reasonable basis for implementation
and which would generate jobs and/or revenues for the local economy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public scoping meetings will be conducted in late March 1994 to allow oral public scoping comments. A notice of time
and place for these meetings will be advertised in local newspapers and mailed to local city officials. It is important
that federal, state, and local agencies and interested individuals take this opportunity to identify environmental
concerns that should be addressed during the preparation of the EIS. Agencies and the public are invited and encouraged

<DOCTITLE>Intent To Prepare a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed Dredging of the Pier D Area at Naval
Shipyard, Puget Sound, Bremerton, WA</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as implemented by the Council on Environmental
Quality regulations (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), the Department of the Navy announces its intent to prepare a Supplemental
Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) to further assess impacts associated with dredging, dredge material disposal,
and other in-water work to support the homeporting of two Fast Combat Support Ships (AOE&hyph;6 Class) at Puget Sound
Naval Shipyard (PSNS), Bremerton, Washington.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) for the AOE&hyph;6 Class West Coast Homeporting Program,
issued in the fall of 1991, included the tiered analysis of the proposed homeporting at PSNS. The AOE&hyph;6 PEIS proposed
the upgrading of Pier D to a deep-draft pier by dredging 170,400 cubic yards of material adjacent to both sides of the
pier to deepen the berthing area. The impact analysis assessed anticipated impacts resulting from dredging operations,
open water dredged materials disposal, and upland dredged materials disposal. A Record of Decision for this action
was issued by the Department of the Navy in March 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Suquamish Indian Tribe appealed a permit for this project that was issued by the City of Bremerton under the Washington
State Shorelines Management Act and the City of Bremerton Shorelines Master Program. The permit is required by the
State of Washington before certifying a proposal under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. The appeal was resolved
when the Navy, State of Washington, City of Bremerton, and the Suquamish Tribe agreed that the Navy would prepare an
SEIS addressing the Pier D upgrade dredging project and additional work related to the dredging project and operations
at the pier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pier D upgrade project involves dredging sediment and making upgrades to Pier D at PSNS in Sinclair Inlet at Puget
Sound. The proposed action will provide two upgraded berths at Pier D capable of handling a minimum of two AOE&hyph;6
Class ships and will also provide the flexibility to berth other deep-draft ships assigned to PSNS. Dredging is proposed
to enlarge the berths at Pier D, currently used for inactive ships. Depths at the AOE&hyph;6 berth (1,073 feet &times;
117 feet) would be increased by this project from the current depths to ^44.4 feet mean lower low water (MLLW). The deep
draft berth (1,073 feet &times; 145 feet) would be increased to ^46.4 feet MLLW, and include a 400 feet &times; 116 feet
area for sea chest intake clearance that would be increased to ^49.4 feet MLLW. A new steel fender pile system will be
added to Pier D to increase the capacity of the existing timber fender piles; remaining timber fender piles will be
replaced. As currently designed, approximately 105,000 cubic yards of marine sediments would be dredged and disposed
of at one or more disposal sites approved for this purpose by various federal, state, and local environmental laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As agreed during the appeal process, the scope of the SEIS will be limited to the potential impacts associated with
the proposed dredging in the vicinity of Pier D, including rehandling dredged material, transportation of dredged
material, and disposal of dredged material. The SEIS will address, but not be limited to, the following issues: (1)
Potential alternatives to the proposal and appropriate mitigation measures; (2) project monitoring to ensure that
environmental quality is maintained; and (3) potential environmental impacts at the Pier D dredge site, including
impacts to land, air, water, plants and animals, environmental health, land and shoreline uses, transportation,
public services, utilities, and related socioeconomic conditions. Specific dredging related impacts to be analyzed
include: (1) Potential impacts to aquatic species; (2) potential impacts associated with the resuspension and exposure
of contaminated sediments in the vicinity of Pier D during dredging operations; (3) potential impacts associated
with post-dredging exposure of contamination, future contamination associated with Pier D dredging activities,
and coordination with cleanup efforts to be undertaken pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act; and (4) potential impacts associated with the handling, transportation, and disposal of dredged
material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies and the public are invited and encouraged to provide written comments regarding issues of concern. To be
most helpful, these comments should clearly describe specific issues or topics which the commentor believes the
SEIS should address. Written statements and/or questions regarding the SEIS should be mailed no later than 30 days
from the date of this publication to Mr. Peter Havens, Code 232, Engineering Field Activity Northwest, Naval Facilities
Engineering Command, 3505 NW Anderson Hill Road, Silverdale, WA 98383&hyph;9130, telephone (206) 396&hyph;5976.

<DOCTITLE>Finding of No Significant Impact; Short-Term Storage of Naval Spent Fuel; Availability for Public Review</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
summary: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program has prepared an Environmental Assessment of short-term storage of Naval spent
nuclear fuel. The preferred alternative is the ``No Action'' alternative. Naval spent fuel removed from nuclear
powered ships would be retained in shipping containers at five shipyards: Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery,
Maine; Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia; Newport News Shipbuilding in Newport News, Virginia; Puget
Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington; and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Naval spent
fuel also would remain in the Surface Ship Support Barge at Newport News Shipbuilding. The Department of Energy (DOE),
with the Navy as a cooperating agency, is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement on longer-term storage of all
DOE spent fuel, including Naval spent fuel. The time period evaluated in the short-term storage Environmental Assessment
is the period through implementation of the Record of Decision for the DOE Environmental Impact Statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Assessment discusses alternatives to the preferred alternative and evaluates the environmental
impacts of both the preferred and other alternatives. The Environmental Assessment concludes that the environmental
impact of any of the alternatives would be very small. Therefore, there is no basis for determining that any of these
alternatives would be environmentally preferable to the others. The No Action alternative, which is the preferred
alternative, would allow all shipyard work, including refueling and defueling of nuclear powered ships, to continue
unimpeded by the short-term accumulation of Naval spent fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program provided a draft of this Environmental Assessment to officials of Virginia,
Maine, New Hampshire, Washington, and Hawaii for review and comment. Letters were received from Congressman Norm
Dicks of Washington and Mr. T.R. Strong of the State of Washington Department of Health, both of whom agreed that the
No Action alternative is appropriate, and Mr. Brian Choy of the State of Hawaii Office of Environmental Quality Control,
who had no comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Strong suggested that the Navy and the State of Washington collaborate in monitoring of radiation levels in the
vicinity of Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and share results of past radiation monitoring. The Program agreed with these
suggestions. Mr. Strong also suggested that the Navy pro-actively inform the public of its plans, emphasizing that
this is a short-term measure, and not in consideration as a long-term solution. In the letters seeking State comments
on the Environmental Assessment, the Navy stated that if the Environmental Assessment justified a Finding of No Significant
Impact, the Navy would make the Finding available for public review prior to a final determination. Accordingly,
the Program is making this Finding and the Environmental Assessment available to State and local officials, the news
media, and the public for a 30 day comment period. The Environmental Assessment on short-term storage of Naval spent
fuel evaluates short-term storage only, and the Finding of No Significant Impact would only cover short-term storage.
However, it should be noted that long-term storage at shipyards is one of the alternatives being considered for Naval
spent fuel in a separate Environmental Impact Statement which DOE is preparing with Navy assistance on spent fuel
management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the analysis in the Environmental Assessment, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program considers that the preferred
alternative is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, within the
meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.). In accordance with the Council
on Environmental Quality regulations which allow agencies to determine circumstances under which public review
of Findings of No Significant Impact are appropriate, the Program is making this Finding available for public comment
for a period of 30 days following the date of

Program prior to a final determination. To facilitate review of this matter, copies of the Environmental Assessment
have been placed in public libraries in the vicinity of the five shipyards. Additionally, persons desiring a copy

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program is a joint Navy/Department of Energy (DOE) organization responsible for all
matters pertaining to Naval nuclear propulsion. The Program is responsible for the nuclear propulsion plants aboard
more than 120 warships powered by over 140 Naval reactors; two moored training ships used for Naval nuclear propulsion
plant operator training; nuclear work performed at eight shipyards; two DOE government-owned laboratories devoted
solely to Naval nuclear propulsion research, development, and design; and eight land-based prototype Naval reactors
used for research and development work and training of Naval nuclear propulsion plant operators. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beginning in 1957, spent fuel removed from nuclear powered ships and prototypes has been sent to the Expended Core
Facility for examination to evaluate its performance and confirm design and operational predictions. The Expended
Core Facility is part of the Naval Reactors Facility which is located within the DOE Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Government has been involved in litigation with the State of Idaho regarding spent nuclear fuel issues
at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho. The Navy became involved in this lawsuit when Idaho requested
an injunction in 1992 against shipments of all spent fuel, including Naval fuel, until DOE completed an Environmental
Impact Statement under the National Environmental Policy Act evaluating activities involving all spent nuclear
fuel at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 28, 1993, the Federal District Court in Idaho granted the State of Idaho's request for an injunction and directed
DOE to evaluate ``The direct and indirect environmental effects of all major federal actions involving the transportation,
receipt, processing, and storage of spent nuclear fuel at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.'' Furthermore,
the Court Order directed DOE to consider the alternative of ``transporting, receiving, processing, and storing
spent nuclear fuel at sites other than the [Idaho] National Engineering Laboratory.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DOE is separately preparing an Environmental Impact Statement on spent nuclear fuel management throughout the
DOE, which includes Naval spent fuel. The Navy is a cooperating agency in this effort. The DOE Environmental Impact
Statement will evaluate alternatives for managing Naval spent fuel from 1995 through 2035, and will consider Naval
Shipyards and other sites for this purpose. A previous 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcement provides further information (Vol. 58, No. 170, page 46951). The DOE Environmental Impact Statement
is scheduled to be published in April 1995 with a Record of Decision by June 1, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Preferred Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If no action were taken, loaded Naval spent fuel shipping containers would accumulate at five shipyards: Portsmouth
Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine; Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia; Newport News Shipbuilding in
Newport News, Virginia; Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington; and Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Naval spent fuel also would remain in the Surface Ship Support Barge at Newport News Shipbuilding.
The No Action alternative, which is the preferred alternative, would allow all shipyard work, including refueling
and defueling of nuclear powered ships, to continue unimpeded by the short-term accumulation of Naval spent fuel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Consolidation Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Consolidation alternative, Naval spent nuclear fuel in shipping containers would be consolidated at Norfolk
Naval Shipyard on the east coast and at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for the Pacific Ocean shipyards. The Surface Ship
Support Barge would remain in use at Newport News Shipbuilding. All other shipyard work, including refueling and
defueling of nuclear powered ships, would continue unimpeded under the Consolidation alternative. However, this
alternative offers no operational advantages to the Navy compared to the No Action alternative, and it would entail
otherwise unnecessary shipping of naval spent fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Moored Ship Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Moored Ship alternative, nuclear powered ship inactivations would be deferred. The nuclear propulsion
plants would be taken to a cold shutdown condition and physically modified to prevent reactor operation, such as by
eliminating the capability to withdraw control rods. Only the ship systems necessary to support eventual defueling
would be maintained. The ship would be tied up at a pier within the controlled industrial area of the shipyard where
it was scheduled to be defueled. Reduced crews would provide surveillance and necessary maintenance of the ships.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Moored Ship alternative has operational disadvantages compared to the No Action and Consolidation alternatives.
It would disrupt shipyard work schedules, idle skilled shipyard defueling and inactivation workers, and utilize
highly trained Navy nuclear ship operators in the unproductive task of watching over shut down ships.

Other Alternatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are no other alternatives for short-term storage of Naval spent fuel which could be implemented within the time
frame under consideration. Alternatives which were considered but found to be impractical for short-term storage
included (1) shipment to Idaho as in the past, which is precluded by the Federal District Court injunction; (2) storage
in commercial dry storage casks, which could not be procured and adapted quickly for use with Naval fuel; and (3) storage
in Navy or DOE water pools, which is precluded in the short-term by space limitations and lack of the necessary storage
racks.

Environmental Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The impacts of the three alternatives have been evaluated both in terms of their specific impacts and the cumulative
impacts of shipyard operation. Since the radioactivity in the spent fuel is totally isolated from the environment
in either the shipping containers, the Surface Ship Support Barge, or in shutdown ships, short-term storage under
any of these alternatives would not result in any additional release of radioactivity under normal conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Environmental Assessment considers several hypothetical accidents involving Naval spent fuel including release
of radioactivity from the fuel during the accident. To summarize, all of the overall accident risks are very small,
less than one chance in 10,000 of a single fatal cancer in the entire population. While the numerical results of the
calculations differ for the various storage modes and locations, the overall risks are so small that accident risks
provide no realistic basis for selecting among the alternatives.

Proposed Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the information and analysis in the Environmental Assessment, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program considers
the No Action alternative not to constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human
environment, within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act. Therefore, the Naval Nuclear Propulsion
Program issues this Finding of No Significant Impact and will make a final determination following a 30 day public
review period.

Site, Richland, Washington. One EIS will address the proposed Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) activities,
and the second will address the proposed construction of six new tanks for the storage of high-level radioactive waste
as an interim action to the TWRS EIS.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces its intent to prepare two EISs pursuant to the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->

.), in accordance with the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations for implementing the procedural provisions
of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508) and the DOE implementing procedures (10 CFR part 1021), and to conduct a series
of public scoping meetings. It is intended that the TWRS EIS cover all TWRS activities that are ripe for decision. In
addition, DOE proposes to prepare an EIS for the construction and operation of six new storage tanks as an interim action
while the TWRS EIS is being prepared, consistent with the provisions of 40 CFR 1506.1. The public scoping period being
announced in this NOI provides an opportunity for the public to comment on the scope of issues to be addressed in both
the TWRS EIS and the new tanks EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The TWRS program is conducted in concert with the Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (also called
the Tri-Party Agreement or TPA) among DOE, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Washington State
Department of Ecology (Ecology). The scope of the TWRS Program includes: Resolution of high-level radioactive waste
tank safety issues; management of high-level waste tank farm operations; upgrading the tank farm infrastructure;
waste characterization; storage of wastes generated from Hanford cleanup activities; tank farm waste retrieval,
conditioning (e.g., evaporation/ dilution), pretreatment (e.g., radionuclide separation), and immobilization
(e.g., vitrification); construction of new high-level waste tanks; storage of immobilized high-activity waste;
storage/disposal of immobilized low-activity waste; management of encapsulated strontium and cesium; and technology
development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE has identified the immediate need for additional interim high-level waste storage capacity to support the resolution
of safety issues associated with ``Watchlist'' tanks as identified pursuant to ``Safety Measures for Waste Tanks
at Hanford Nuclear Reservation,'' section 3137 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991, P.L.
101&hyph;510. As an interim action to the TWRS EIS, the new tanks EIS will address the proposed construction and operation
of six new underground storage tanks to support the resolution of safety issues concerning the high-level waste in
existing tanks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In March 1993, DOE completed a rebaselining of the TWRS program to ensure that the program to remediate Hanford tank
wastes is comprehensive, integrated and technically sound. Subsequently, the TPA was renegotiated and revised.
Public meetings on the revised TPA were held in several locations statewide during November 1993. The revised TPA
is expected to be signed by all parties on January 25, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TWRS program actions constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the environment and,
accordingly, DOE has developed a strategy for providing the appropriate NEPA reviews for the actions. The strategy
consists of a TWRS EIS for the overall proposed action to treat, store, and dispose of Hanford's stored high-level
tank waste, and an EIS for the new tanks as an interim action. In addition, separate NEPA reviews for other interim actions
may need to be initiated during preparation of the TWRS EIS and the new tanks EIS. Such interim actions would include
activities needed to maintain the current waste management system; collect data and resolve urgent pretreatment
issues; and protect both the workers, the public and the environment. The TWRS EIS will address the cumulative impacts
of the TWRS program including the new tanks and other interim actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In December 1987 the DOE completed the ``Final Environmental Impact Statement on the Disposal of Hanford Defense
High-Level, Transuranic and Tank Wastes'' (HDW EIS), which addressed the environmental consequences of alternatives
for disposal of wastes generated during national defense activities and stored at the Hanford site. A Record of Decision
(ROD) issued in April 1988 has formed the basis for DOE's programs to manage these wastes at the Hanford site.

In the HDW EIS ROD, DOE deferred final disposal decisions for the tank wastes contained in single-shell tanks (SSTs),
pending further evaluations in a supplemental EIS. However, to meet regulatory requirements, DOE's current planning
basis is to retrieve SST waste, and to integrate double-shell tank (DST) and SST waste management activities leading
to final disposal. Because DOE now proposes to integrate SST and DST waste management programs, the TWRS EIS described
in this NOI will replace the previously planned supplement to the HDW EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TWRS EIS will address the DOE's proposal for the management, treatment, storage, and disposal of the waste currently
stored in the existing 149 SSTs and 28 DSTs and other wastes to be generated during future decontamination and decommissioning
activities at Hanford. DOE recognizes that removal of waste from the tanks may trigger Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (RCRA) treatment and disposal requirements to complete closure of the tanks. However, the impacts of
tank closure cannot be meaningfully evaluated at this time. DOE will conduct an appropriate NEPA review, such as an
EIS to support tank closure, in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The planned interim action EIS will address the construction of six new tanks and associated new transfer lines, and
the tank operations. For the purposes of this interim action EIS, operations considered would be limited to the retrieval,
pH adjustment or alkalinity control, and storage of wastes from the Watchlist safety tanks. The primary focus of the
EIS would be the resolution of safety issues related to the three tanks that are on the Watchlist because of hydrogen
generation (241&hyph;SY&hyph;101, 241&hyph;SY&hyph;103 and 241&hyph;AN&hyph;104), but the tanks may also be
used to alleviate safety concerns in other Watchlist tanks (50 tanks are currently on the Watchlist). Further decisions
regarding the retrieval, treatment and disposal of wastes from the Watchlist tanks will be the subject of the TWRS
EIS.

Each scoping session will begin with a welcome and introduction of DOE officials, followed by short presentations
by DOE officials on the EIS process, the Hanford TWRS program and the proposed interim actions. Individuals and organization
spokespersons will then have an opportunity to present oral comments to DOE representatives. The agenda will be repeated
twice a day at each location, in afternoon and evening sessions. The hours for the sessions are: 1 pm to 4:30 pm and 6:30
pm to 10 pm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requests to speak at these meetings may be made by calling the toll-free telephone number, 1&hyph;800&hyph;500&hyph;1660,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meetings will be chaired by a presiding officer but will not be conducted as evidentiary hearings; speakers will
not be cross-examined although the presiding officer and DOE representatives present may ask clarifying questions.
Individuals requesting to speak on behalf of an organization must identify the organization. A 5-minute limit will
be imposed on each individual speaker except that a speaker representing an organization (one per organization)
will be given a 10-minute limit. These limits are to ensure that all who wish to speak have an opportunity to do so. Comments
will be recorded by a court reporter and will become part of the scoping meeting record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who have not submitted a request to speak in advance of the scoping meetings may register at the meetings and
will be called on to speak on a first-come first-served basis as time permits. Written comments will also be accepted
at the meetings, and speakers are encouraged to provide written versions of their oral comments for the record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE will review scoping comments to determine their applicability to the two proposed EISs. Records of, and responses
to, the scoping comments will be provided as appropriate in either the Implementation Plan (IP) for the TWRS EIS or
the IP for the new tanks EIS. The IPs will provide guidance for preparation of the TWRS and new tanks EISs and establish
their scopes and content (10 CFR 1021.312). The IPs will be issued prior to the release of the draft EISs and copies will
be available for inspection in public reading room locations to be announced.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal government created the Hanford Site, near Richland, Washington, in 1943, as part of the Manhattan Project,
to produce plutonium for national defense. Metallic uranium fuel was irradiated in nuclear reactors and then the
fuel was chemically processed to recover plutonium. Plutonium production at the Hanford Site stopped in 1988.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Processing of reactor fuel and other waste management activities created a wide variety of radioactive wastes, including
high-level wastes that have been stored in underground tanks. The high-level wastes came from many different processes
and sources, and they have been processed and transferred among tanks so that chemical and physical characteristics
of the wastes vary greatly among tanks and even within individual tanks. Typically, the tank wastes are highly radioactive
and chemically hazardous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSTs have one steel wall, surrounded by reinforced concrete; they were constructed between 1944 and 1964 and received
waste until 1980. The capacity of most SSTs is 0.5 million gallons (Mgal) to 1.0 Mgal. The tanks are situated below grade
and are covered with 6 to 10 feet of earth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste in SSTs consists of liquids, sludges, and saltcake, i.e., crusty solids made of crystallized salts. Some of
the liquids in the SSTs are contained in the pores of the sludges and saltcake, and some liquids are free standing in
the tanks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are 149 SSTs storing about 36 Mgal of waste. This waste is comprised of approximately 0.6 Mgal of free-standing
liquid, 23.2 Mgal of saltcake, and 12.5 Mgal of sludge. About half of the SSTs have leaked or are assumed to have leaked.
Approximately 0.6 to 0.9 Mgal of waste has leaked or spilled into the nearby soil. Over the years, much of the liquid
stored in SSTs has evaporated or been pumped to DSTs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are 28 one Mgal DSTs at Hanford. The DSTs were constructed between 1970 and 1986. Most of these tanks are designed
for up to 50 years of storage. DSTs have a second steel containment wall. The space between the two walls is monitored
for leaks. DOE has used the DSTs since 1970 and none has been known to leak. The DSTs are used to treat and store a variety
of liquid radioactive wastes from the SSTs and from various Hanford Site processes. The wastes are stored in tanks
based upon composition, level of radioactivity, or origin. The DSTs now contain about 25 Mgal of waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1960s and 1970s, radioactive strontium and cesium were extracted from wastes in some SSTs. The strontium and
cesium were converted to salt forms and placed in double-walled capsules. Most of the 610 strontium capsules and 1323
cesium capsules are stored at Hanford. Some capsules were shipped offsite for beneficial use as heat or radiation
sources. Because the capsules were only leased from DOE, it is anticipated that they will be returned to Hanford. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the April 1988 HDW EIS ROD, DOE decided to proceed with preparing the DST waste for final disposal because it was readily
retrievable. Wastes were to be processed in a pretreatment facility (planned to be the Hanford B-Plant and AR Vault)
to separate DST waste into two portions. The larger portion would be low activity waste, and a much smaller portion
would be highly radioactive. The low activity waste was to be mixed with a cement-like material to form grout. The grout
was to be poured into large, lined, concrete, near-surface, underground vaults where it would solidify. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The high activity waste fraction was to be made into a borosilicate glass and poured into stainless-steel canisters
(approximately 0.6 m diameter by 3 m long) at the proposed Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant (HWVP). The canisters
were to be stored there until a geologic repository was ready to receive this waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing and future DST wastes were to be characterized for hazardous chemical constituents as well as other constituents
that might affect glass or grout formulations before processing. This characterization would also help ensure that
proper treatment, in accordance with hazardous waste regulations, occurred before disposal of the waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HDW EIS ROD also called for storage of cesium and strontium capsules to continue until a geologic repository is
ready to receive this waste for disposal. Before shipment to the repository, the capsules would be packaged to meet
repository acceptance criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the HDW EIS ROD, DOE decided to conduct additional development and evaluation before making decisions on final
disposal of SST wastes. This development and evaluation effort was to focus both on methods to retrieve and process
SST wastes for disposal and to stabilize and isolate the wastes near-surface. SST waste would continue to be stored
and monitored. Before a decision on the final disposal of the wastes could be made, the alternatives were to be analyzed
in a supplement to the HDW EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several significant changes have occurred subsequent to the HDW EIS. These include the identification of significant
waste tank safety issues; the DOE, EPA and Ecology signing the TPA; the elimination of B-Plant from consideration
as a waste pretreatment facility; the delay of the HWVP; and the proposal to treat SST waste with DST waste. These changes
resulted in DOE's proposal to integrate all Hanford tank waste remediation efforts. As a result, resolving waste
tank safety issues, planning for SST waste retrieval, and developing pretreatment facilities have become major
elements of the proposed Hanford tank waste remediation program.

DOE needs to take action to treat, store, and dispose of Hanford's stored high-level tank waste and encapsulated strontium
and cesium and to reduce the overall potential risks posed by the tank wastes. This entails addressing four major programmatic
elements: Retrieval, pretreatment, immobilization, and storage/disposal. More specifically, these programmatic
elements include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Retrieval of SST and DST wastes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Conditioning (e.g., evaporation/dilution) of wastes.

&bull;Management of encapsulated strontium and cesium inventory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE also needs to address closure of tanks (including disposal of tanks, piping, ancillary facilities, and contaminated
soil). Although tank closure is included in the TPA, closure is not included in the proposed action for the TWRS EIS
because the impacts of tank closure cannot be meaningfully evaluated at this time. DOE will conduct an appropriate
NEPA review, such as preparing a tank closure EIS, in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
TWRS EIS Alternatives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of alternatives can be constructed from the range of options available for the four major subcomponents of
the TWRS, which are retrieval, pretreatment, immobilization and storage/disposal. Combinations of these options
comprise the range of reasonable alternatives currently envisioned for TWRS. The TPA establishes one specific case
within the range of alternatives to be considered in the TWRS EIS. The TWRS EIS will also evaluate a number of other alternatives
constructed from the range of options described for the four major subcomponents of the TWRS and a no-action alternative
in order to adequately evaluate the full range of potential environmental impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
TPA Preferred Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 31, 1993, DOE, EPA, and Ecology agreed to enter into formal negotiations on matters relating to Hanford tank
waste remediation, environmental restoration activities, cost control, and implementation and administration
of the Hanford Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. The negotiations were concluded in September 1993,
with tentative agreement on all matters under negotiation. The revised TPA received public review during November
1993, and the TPA was scheduled to be signed by the three parties on January 25, 1994. The full TPA covers subjects outside
the purview of the TWRS program. The elements of the TPA which are within the scope of the TWRS program constitute elements
of the preferred alternative for purposes of the TWRS EIS. Accordingly, the TPA preferred alternative consists of
the following activities: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Upgrading the infrastructure of the high-level waste tank farms to provide improved facility management
and operation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Characterization of the wastes in all 177 SSTs and DSTs to facilitate treatment, immobilization and disposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Construction and operation of additional DSTs (beyond the six tanks proposed in the interim action EIS noticed
here) as necessary to support waste management and disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Stabilization of SST waste by removing and storing the pumpable liquids in DSTs, thus reducing the potential
for leaks to the surrounding soil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Retrieval of the waste from SSTs and DSTs with priority on the SSTs. The retrieval criterion is removal of 99%
of the waste from all SSTs on a tank-by-tank basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Construction and operation of a waste pretreatment facility to treat the tank waste and to prepare the low-activity
fraction for final processing. The high-activity fraction of the waste would be stored pending final processing.
Separate complexes would be constructed to house enhanced sludge washing and cesium and strontium ion exchange processes.
An evaporator would be included in the low-activity waste pretreatment complex. These complexes could be stand-alone
facilities, a set of distributed facilities, or part of a central processing complex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Construction and operation of a low-activity waste vitrification plant of appropriate capacity. Bounding

to restart the grout facility if its operation is necessary before new DSTs are available to provide tank space to resolve
safety issues.

Options for Retrieval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Waste can be retrieved by hydraulic sluicing, pneumatic or mechanical systems. Hydraulic sluicing injects liquid
into the tank to dislodge and mobilize or dissolve the waste. Pumps transfer the liquid and slurry out of the tank. Mechanical
or pneumatic systems are placed in contact with the waste. This equipment conditions the waste and transfers it out
of the tank. The retrieved waste is transferred to the pretreatment process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Options for Pretreatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pretreatment is performed to separate the waste into its high-activity and low-activity components. One option
is to perform no pretreatment. Another option is to limit the volume of waste going to a geologic repository by pretreating
waste to accomplish some level of high- and low-activity waste separation. Two bounding alternatives for pretreating
tank wastes have been identified, corresponding to the reasonable limits of waste pretreatment (such as evaporation,
acid digestion, nuclide separation, ion exchange) to concentrate the radionuclides in a smaller volume. For purposes
of this discussion, these bounds are referred to as ``minimal'' and ``extensive'' pretreatment. The pretreatment
bounds may also influence the relative volumes of high- and low-activity wastes to be stabilized and stored/disposed
of. The pretreated waste would be transferred to the waste immobilization process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Minimal pretreatment would use sludge washing to separate the waste into a smaller volume fraction of high-activity
waste (containing the majority of radionuclide activity), and a larger volume fraction of low-activity waste. The
low-activity waste might be subjected to an evaporation step to reduce the volume resulting from the sludge washing
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Extensive pretreatment would use advanced solvent extraction methods to provide the maximum level of radionuclide
partitioning. Hazardous nitrates, metals, and other selected chemicals would be removed from the low-activity
waste stream, and the volume of the high-activity waste fraction would be minimized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Options for Immobilization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The immobilization would stabilize the waste coming from the pretreatment process. Both the low-activity waste
stream and the high-activity waste stream would be stabilized. The stabilized waste would be transferred to storage
or disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
High-activity waste stabilization options include vitrification, ceramic forms and calcination. After stabilizing,
the high-activity waste fraction would comply with any likely waste form criteria for geologic repository acceptance
and transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Low-activity waste stabilization options include vitrification, glass cullet in a sulfur cement and cement polymer-based
grout. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current plan provides that the encapsulated cesium and strontium would meet the waste form criteria for geologic
repository acceptance and transportation. The first option is overpacking the capsules. If the repository waste
form criteria cannot be achieved by overpacking, the capsules would be stabilized the same as the high-activity waste
fraction above (e.g., vitrification, ceramic or calcination).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Options for Disposal/Storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The disposal options include disposal onsite, disposal offsite and interim storage pending disposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
High-activity waste disposal options include emplacement of the stabilized waste in an offsite geologic repository
or in interim storage onsite pending availability of an offsite geologic repository. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Low-activity waste disposal options depend on the stabilized waste form and include: Burial in onsite landfills
in containers; burial in onsite vaults; burial onsite in steel culverts with liners and leachate collection; and
soil melt slurry injection to a landfill. Some of these options would accommodate retrievability if desired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

No Action Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The no action alternative for TWRS would be continued storage of tank wastes and encapsulated cesium and strontium
without preparation for disposal. However, the no action alternative includes continued maintenance, monitoring,
and safety upgrades. No action also includes maintaining the low-activity waste grouting facility in a standby condition
in case its operation is necessary before new DSTs are available to provide tank space to resolve safety issues. The
no-disposal action alternative was analyzed in the HDW EIS and the DOE intends to update the HDW EIS analyses in the
TWRS EIS. The no action alternative is included to comply with the CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1502.14(d)) for consideration
of a no action alternative.

Interim Actions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOE plans to complete the TWRS EIS by approximately October 1996. DOE may need to undertake interim actions while the
TWRS EIS is being prepared. Any interim actions undertaken would have to be independently justified because, for
example, they are activities needed to maintain the current waste management system; collect data and resolve urgent
pretreatment issues; or protect workers, the public and the environment. Any interim actions would be actions on
which decisions were needed prior to the scheduled completion of the TWRS EIS. None of the interim actions would prejudice
the ultimate decision to be made on the basis of the TWRS EIS because they would be needed regardless of which alternatives
are selected in that EIS. As described previously in this notice, DOE has already identified the construction of new
tank capacity needed to resolve tank safety issues (identified in the TPA as the Multi-function Waste Tank Facility)
as an interim action, and is planning to prepare a separate EIS for that project. DOE plans to complete the new tanks
EIS by September 1994 to support a near-term TPA milestone.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Other interim actions may include system and infrastructure upgrades, replacement of the cross-site transfer system,
waste characterization, technology development and demonstration activities including a compact processing
unit, and initial retrieval or pretreatment and immobilization activities. These activities, if undertaken, would
also require preparation of independent NEPA reviews while the TWRS EIS is in preparation.

Proposed Actions, New Tanks EIS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed new tanks would provide waste storage space needed for resolution of tank safety issues and would not
be used for storage of newly generated high-level waste. The new tanks would be improved versions of the existing DSTs.
Each tank would be constructed of double shell stainless steel surrounded by a concrete liner, and would have a 1 million
gallon capacity. All tanks would have leak detection monitoring systems and filtered ventilation systems. The EIS
will address the construction of new tanks and associated new transfer lines, and the tank operations. For the purposes
of this interim action EIS, operations considered would be limited to the retrieval, pH adjustment or alkalinity
control, and storage of wastes from the Watchlist safety tanks. The primary focus of the EIS would be the resolution
of safety issues related to the three tanks that are on the Watchlist because of hydrogen generation (241&hyph;SY&hyph;101,
241&hyph;SY&hyph;103 and 241&hyph;AN&hyph;104), but the tanks may also be used to alleviate safety concerns in
other Watchlist tanks (50 tanks are currently on the Watchlist). Further decisions regarding the disposition of
these wastes will be addressed by the TWRS EIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Alternatives, New Tanks EIS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new tanks EIS will evaluate all reasonable alternatives. Alternatives which have been tentatively identified
for possible evaluation in this EIS include but are not limited to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
TPA Preferred Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The TPA preferred alternative is to construct two DSTs in the 200 West Area by 1997 and four DSTs in the 200 East Area by
1998. These new tanks would be utilized to store wastes retrieved from Watchlist tanks in order to resolve tank safety
issues. Resolution of safety issues for these Watchlist tanks may include up to a three-to-one dilution of the wastes
with water and/or caustic solutions. In order to achieve this dilution a combination of new and existing tank space
would be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Construct Fewer Tanks
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this alternative, the need for additional tanks would be reduced using alternatives to retrieval for tank safety
issue mitigation. An example would be the use of mixer pumps for mitigating the flammable gas safety issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
No Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EIS will also address the no action alternative, under which no additional underground high-level waste storage
tanks would be built in the near term. No action would leave the safety issues for the Watchlist safety tanks unresolved.

Regulatory Framework 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The TPA sets milestones to achieve coordinated cleanup of the Hanford Site and provides a legal and procedural framework
for regulatory compliance during cleanup. During the development of both EISs, DOE intends to fully comply with the
TPA, as modified by the change control process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal and State laws that are of major importance to waste management activities at Hanford include the Atomic Energy
Act of 1954; RCRA; the Washington State Hazardous Waste Management Act, Chapter 70.105 RCW; and the Federal Facility
Compliance Act of 1992. The Atomic Energy Act requires the management, processing, and use of radioactive materials
in a manner that protects workers, public health, and the environment. RCRA and the Washington State Hazardous Waste
Management Act establish requirements for management of hazardous waste, including generation, treatment, storage,
transportation, and disposal. RCRA also requires cleanup of hazardous waste releases from past and present operations
when the releases pose a threat to human health or the environment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This is a Floodplain Statement of Findings for the Proposed Installation of Bedrock and Unconsolidated Monitoring
Wells on the Oak Ridge K&hyph;25 Site, prepared in accordance with 10 CFR part 1022. A Notice of Floodplain Involvement
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 4, 1993, and a floodplain assessment was prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To facilitate future remedial actions at the K&hyph;25 Site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act (CERCLA), DOE is proposing to drill four borings. Two borings would be into bedrock to depths ranging
from approximately 30 to 150 feet, and the two other borings would be in the unconsolidated sediments overlying the
bedrock to depths from approximately 15 to 50 feet. Two locations would be involved, with one bedrock and one unconsolidated
monitoring well at each location. Each borehole would be converted to a monitoring well for the purpose of collecting
hydrologic and water quality data. The wells are proposed to be located in the floodplain because the sites were selected
to intersect and monitor subsurface flow paths near Poplar Creek. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives to the proposed action included (1) No action, and (2) alternate sites. The no action alternative would
result in DOE being unable to accurately measure possible contaminant releases to the local environment. Alternate
sites away from Poplar Creek (outside of the floodplain) could not adequately monitor subsurface flow paths. The
proposed action is necessary to enable DOE to pursue future remedial actions and meet the requirements of CERCLA.
The assessment reveals that the installation of monitoring wells at the K&hyph;25 site would have no adverse impact
on the 100-year floodplain of Poplar Creek, nor alter the existing normal channel cross section or storage capacity
of Poplar Creek. No measures are needed to minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplain. The proposed
action would conform to applicable State or local floodplain protection standards. DOE will endeavor to allow 15
days of public review after publication of the Statement of Findings prior to implementing the proposed action.

The order required Panhandle to make certain modifications to the tariff sheets previously submitted. Thus, Section
18.1 of the General Terms and Conditions has been modified to define the method of calculating load factors for new
customers. In addition, as required by the Order, Panhandle has clarified the rate tariff sheets to reflect that the
minimum GRI surcharge is zero.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

sheets and applicable state regulatory commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825

in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(December 30 Order), Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) on January 14, 1994, submitted for
filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, the tariff sheets listed on Appendix A of the filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Eastern states that the December 30 Order accepted tariff sheets filed on December 1, 1993 (December 1 Filing)
by Texas Eastern to recover gas supply realignment costs (GSR Costs). The December 1 Filing was Texas Eastern's third
quarterly filing to recover such costs and was filed pursuant to section 15.2(C) of the General Terms and Conditions
of Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1. Ordering Paragraph (A) of the December 30 Order required
certain tariff sheets be ``refiled within fifteen days of this order to conform to the conditions set forth in the body
of this order, and the ordering paragraphs below.'' Texas Eastern states that the tariff sheets listed in Appendix
A are submitted to satisfy the requirements of the December 30 Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Eastern states that section 15.2(C) of the General Terms and Conditions has been revised in compliance with
the December 30 Order as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Section 15.2(C)(2)(a) has been revised to extend the amortization and recovery period to two (2) years for buyout
costs which are incurred after January 1, 1994 and which, in the aggregate, exceed fifteen (15) million dollars for
a quarterly filing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Section 15.2(C)(2)(a)(i) has been revised to reflect that applicable customers under Rate Schedules CDS, FT&hyph;1,
LLFT and VKFT will be billed each month for a GSR Demand Surcharge Amount calculated by multiplying their current MDQ
for a month times the GSR Demand Surcharge rate;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Section 15.2(C)(2)(a)(ii) has been revised to reflect that with the exception of the GSR Demand Surcharge component
already designed to be paid over twenty-four (24) months, each customer shall have the option of paying its GSR Demand
Surcharge obligation for any quarter in twenty-four (24) monthly installments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Section 15.2(C)(2)(a)(iv) has been revised to clarify that the payment obligation for the GSR Demand Surcharge
Amounts, together with applicable carrying charges, accrues in full as of the close of the month in which service was
provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Section 15.2(C)(5) has been added to reflect an annual true-up, as of any twelve (12) month period ending June 30,
of the recovery of GSR costs allocated to be recovered from customers under Rate Schedules CDS, FT&hyph;1, LLFT and
VKFT.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Eastern states that pursuant to section 15.2(C) of the General Terms and Conditions, ninety percent (90%) of
GSR Costs are allocated to customers under Texas Eastern's Rate Schedules CDS, FT&hyph;1, LLFT, and VKFT in the form
of a CSR Demand Surcharge calculated using customer MDQs. Texas Eastern's December 1 Filing allocated $12,701,656
of GSR Costs, inclusive of prior period adjustments and carrying charges, to its customers under Rate Schedules CDS,
FT&hyph;1, LLFT and VKFT. However, Texas Eastern states that total customer MDQs under Rate Schedules CDS, FT&hyph;1,
LLFT and VKFT have changed slightly since the December 1 Filing. Attachment A details the calculation of the new GSR
Demand Surcharge unit rate based upon MDQs effective January 1, 1994. As a result, Texas Eastern submits Sub Sixth
Revised Sheet No. 25, Sub Sixth Revised Sheet No. 30, Sub Third Revised Sheet No. 34A, Sub Third Revised Sheet No. 34B,
Sub Third Revised Sheet No. 42A, and Sub Second Revised Sheet No. 42B to reflect this slight change in total firm customer
MDQs. Texas Eastern states that the rates for Rate Schedules IT&hyph;1, PTI, LLIT and VKIT are not impacted by the slight
change in total firm customer MDQs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed effective date of the tariff sheets is January 1, 1994, consistent with the December 30 Order or the effective
date of the tariff sheets they replace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Eastern states that copies of the filing were served on firm customers of Texas Eastern and interested state
commission. Copies were also served on all parties to Docket No. RP94&hyph;66&hyph;000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas Eastern states that in compliance with the Order, Section 15.4 of the General Terms and Conditions has been modified
to define the method of calculating load factors for firm customers without a historical load factor for purposes
of the GRI Surcharge. In addition, as required by the Order, Texas Eastern states that it has added a column to the affected
rate sheets to reflect that the minimum GRI Surcharge is zero.

Take notice that on January 11, 1994, Valero Transmission, L.P. (Valero), P.O. Box 500, San Antonio, Texas 78215,
filed an application in Docket No. CP91&hyph;2778&hyph;001, pursuant to Section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), 15
U.S.C. 717b, part 153 of the Commission's Regulations, Executive Order Nos. 10485 and 12038, and the Secretary of
Energy's Delegation Order No. 0204&hyph;112. Valero seeks to amend its Presidential Permit and prior authorizations
granted in Docket No. CP91&hyph;2778&hyph;000
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 to permit the use of its existing facilities at the United States-Mexico Border for the importation, as well as exportation
of natural gas. Valero's request is more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public
inspection.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Valero states that the facilities are currently being used to export natural gas to Mexico. Valero states that the
opening-up of these facilities to a two-way gas trade will provide needed flexibility to respond to changing market
conditions. Valero indicates that its border facilities will be available on an ``open-access'' basis to any shipper/supplier
with authorization from the Department of Energy (DOE) to import or export natural gas from or to Mexico. Finally,
Valero states that the switch to two-way gas trade will not require the construction of any additional facilities.
Therefore, there will be no adverse environmental impact associated with the approval of its application.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given that the State of Florida is revising its approved State Public Water Supply Supervision Primacy
Program. Florida has adopted drinking water regulations for Lead and Copper, and Phase II (IOCs/SOCs). EPA has determined
that these sets of State program revisions are no less stringent than the corresponding Federal regulations. Therefore,
EPA has tentatively decided to approve these State program revisions in accordance with the conditions set forth
in the December 22, 1993 letter from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to the USEPA, Region IV.

<DOCTITLE>Environmental Leadership Program: Update </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA announces the next steps in the development of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Leadership Program (ELP). After reviewing many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible options, the Agency has decided to proceed with pilot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects to test the feasibility of a voluntary program to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognize industrial facilities. The pilots will explore ways to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage facilities to develop innovative audit and compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs and to reduce the risk of non-compliance through pollution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevention practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wide variety of public comments on the original ELP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal (published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 15, 1993) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly indicated an interest in a program to recognize and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage ``environmental excellence.'' While no true consensus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emerged on the best structure or goals for the program, several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
themes were common to the majority of the comments: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;EPA should encourage companies and facilities of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 sizes and from all industries to participate in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;EPA should focus its program on individual facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 rather than on entire corporations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Any EPA-developed statement of environmental principles 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 would duplicate existing private-sector efforts and would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 be difficult to enforce. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to these comments, EPA has decided to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing a voluntary, facility-based program. The Agency will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop pilot projects with specific industries and states to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate the many unresolved issues raised during the comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. These include a possible multiple-tier structure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encourage broad participation, determining the role of compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-reporting of violations, public accountability, the role of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incentives in encouraging companies to exceed minimum requirements, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and how pollution prevention practices can help facilities reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or avoid the risk of non-compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Deputy Administrator Bob Sussman and Steve Herman, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assistant Administrator for the Office of Enforcement and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance Assurance (OECA) have been asked to coordinate this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effort. The Agency will provide more information on the process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for selecting pilot participants and on the development of test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects in the early spring of 1994. The Office of Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within OECA will be responsible for this process. Please call Mike 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Schiavo at (202) 260&hyph;2824 for more information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also in response to the comments, the Agency has concluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it will not issue its own guidelines for corporate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental principles, but rather work cooperatively with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
many other organizations that have developed corporate and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry-wide codes of environmental conduct. The Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pollution Prevention and Toxics will take responsibility for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representing the Agency in this area, and for ensuring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involvement of other EPA offices where appropriate. Please call 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
David Kling at (202) 260&hyph;3557 for more information. EPA thanks all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of those who have expressed an interest in the ELP concept and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
looks forward to making this program an exciting and effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach to pollution prevention and compliance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Innovative Technology Council, comprised of EPA management and staff
from across the Agency, has drafted a strategy to focus and target its efforts to accelerate environmental technology
development, commercialization and use. The Council recognizes a need to accelerate the development, commercialization,
and use of innovative environmental technologies to maintain and improve environmental quality at home and abroad
into the 21st century. Environmental quality would deteriorate, given foreseeable population growth and industrialization,
unless technology is developed and more broadly applied, that is more effective in preventing and reducing pollution
levels, less costly than existing technology and supportive of sustainable development. EPA, state and local agencies
are in a unique position to influence the rate and focus of environmental technology innovation and use because of
their legislative and programmatic mandates and regulatory responsibilities (which often influence the demand
for environmental technologies, goods and services). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In funding the President's Environmental Technology Initiative, the House Committee on Appropriations directed
EPA, ``*&blank;*&blank;* to develop a comprehensive environmental technology strategy characterized by innovation
and a nonbureaucratic approach.''

EPA's draft Strategy provides a plan to directly and indirectly support private sector innovation and diffusion
activities sponsored by the public and private sector and close coordination among Federal agencies. It focuses
on creating incentives for the development and use of innovative technologies in federal and state environmental
regulations, reducing barriers to technology innovation and use, and improving the competitiveness of the environmental
technology industry in domestic and international markets. EPA and other Federal, state and local agencies, universities,
trade associations and consortia, and numerous private companies are already working in many of the areas identified
in the Strategy. EPA is seeking public comment on the Strategy to focus and target efforts to accelerate environmental
technology development, commercialization and use. The Agency's Innovative Technology Council plans to revise
and update the Strategy based on the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of ``environmental technologies'' being addressed in the Strategy varies widely for a number of reasons.
The ``environmental technology industry'' has only recently become a focal point for market analysts and policy-makers,
and it is highly diversified in terms of the current demand for and supply of technologies, goods and services. Demand
often varies based on local environmental conditions. ``Environmental technologies'' include technologies,
goods, and services whose development is triggered primarily by environmental improvement objectives. Sometimes
referred to as ``dark green'' technologies, these include: products and services to monitor and assess pollutant
releases and exposure levels; innovative technologies which prevent pollution, control air and water pollution
levels, and remediate contaminated soil and groundwater; and, manage environmental data. EPA's Strategy also addresses
``light green'' technologies that are developed primarily for non-environmental reasons; those technologies
can have indirect, but important consequences for improving environmental quality. An example, would be local area
computer networks designed to enhance office communication, but which also reduce paper use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is interested in promoting all phases of technological change such as: the research and development of new concepts;
preliminary design testing and pilot applications of evolving technologies; performance demonstrations and testing;
evaluations of early commercial applications; and diffusion into domestic and international markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft ``Technology Innovation Strategy'' outlines the general principles that guide EPA in its efforts to foster
innovation in its existing programs and new projects being initiated under the President's Environmental Technology
Initiative (see below). It outlines four objectives: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Adapt EPA's policy, regulatory, and compliance framework to promote innovation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Strengthen the capacity of technology developers and users to succeed in environmental technology innovation;

solutions to environmental problems? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Do you agree with the Strategy's objectives and with EPA's approaches to achieving them? Which objectives should
receive the highest priority for action? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Are there additional areas of emphasis that EPA should address in planning and funding its technology development,
commercialization, and diffusion activities? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Are there particular environmental technology needs or impediments to development on which you feel the Agency
should focus more of its attention?

Environmental Technology Initiative (ETI) FY 1994 Program Plan, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
described later in this notice, provides detailed descriptions of the ETI budget themes and projects being funded
this fiscal year. Planning for FY 1995 is now underway and EPA is interested in receiving comments from the public on
specific focus areas that should be emphasized in funding projects next year. These focus areas may be within the broad
context of an entire technology innovation area or may be specific to one facet of EPA's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strategy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An example of a broad focus area recommendation would be the need for EPA assistance in all aspects of encouraging the
development and use of more cost-effective technologies for small businesses. An example of a focus area recommendation

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In his State of the Union speech on February 17, 1993, President Clinton outlined a new initiative to improve environmental
quality and strengthen the American economy. The goal of the President's Environmental Technology Initiative (ETI)
is to spur the development and use of more advanced environmental systems and treatment techniques that can yield
domestic environmental benefits and increase exports of American technologies to other countries. ``Dark green''
environmental technologies are being emphasized in the Initiative that is, technologies, goods, and services whose
development is triggered primarily by environmental improvement objectives. ``Dark green'' technologies include:
products and services to monitor and assess pollutant releases and exposure levels; innovative technologies which
prevent pollution, control air and water pollution levels, and remediate contaminated soil and groundwater; and,
manage environmental data. The Initiative is funded at $36 million in FY 1994 and, in the President's plan, is to be
funded at $80 million in FY 1995, with overall funding projected to be $1.8 billion over nine years. In approving funding
for Fiscal Year 1994, the Senate Appropriations Committee instructed the Agency to develop a detailed program plan

The Program Plan released today is not a solicitation or request for proposals for grants or contracts from EPA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It describes the nature and scope of work in each project area and invites interested parties to contact individual
project managers, especially if they are working on a similar project or they are interested in becoming a project
partner. Project managers will, in turn, be developing partnerships among interested parties who can share in the
projects' activities and results. EPA anticipates that federal agencies, state and local governments, tribes,
educational institutions, non-profit and not-for profit entities, and private sector parties may be interested
in discussing partnership opportunities. By this approach, EPA is seeking to engage and leverage the creativity,
expertise, and resources of other government agencies and the private sector in areas of mutual interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both the Administration and the Congress have stressed the need for partnerships that provide both direct support
to private sector innovation and close coordination with other Federal agencies. These partnerships may take many
forms. For example, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the ``Clean Car Technology Demonstration Program'' (Project No. 11), EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions
laboratory and Office of Air and Radiation, the Department of Energy, and the National Institute for Science and Technology,
other Federal laboratories, and domestic manufacturers are demonstrating ways to improve passenger car and light
truck fuel economy and technologies which lower carbon dioxide emissions. To promote technologies that prevent
pollution in small businesses, EPA, the International Fabricare Institute, Neighborhood Cleaners Association,
Greenpeace, and the Occupational Health Foundation are working on dry and wet cleaning technologies that do not use
perchloroethylene (Project No. 33). To improve the U.S. environmental technology industry's competitiveness
abroad, EPA, the Agency for International Development, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, the Export-Import
Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation are proposing ways to demonstrate the performance of pollution
control, monitoring and pollution prevention technologies globally and at sites to be selected in Asia, Central
or Eastern Europe or Mexico (Project No. 53).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For some projects, EPA may transfer funding to another Federal agency that will match those funds with funds of their
own or with those of a private sector partner. Not all collaborative efforts, however, may entail transfers of funding
among Federal partners or private partners. Rather, EPA is more interested in finding partners who can offer collaboration,
resources and expertise to make each project a success. Many partnership opportunities are available. For example:

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66, Title VI, Section 6002(b), 107 Stat 312, 395
(1993), amended Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 153(n) and 332, to create
a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services. Under the amended statute, certain private
land mobile radio licensees will be reclassified as ``commercial mobile radio service'' licensees will be treated
as common carriers subject to the foreign ownership and control restrictions of Section 310(b) of the Communications
Act. A ``grandfathering'' provision, however, permits the Commission to grant waivers of Section 310(b) to private
land mobile licensees that petition the Commission by February 10, 1994. This present action clarifies the filing
procedures for such petitions and reminds all potentially affected private radio licensees of the February 10, 1994
filing deadline.

The FCC Forms 495A and 495B implement the FCC's Joint Cost Order, CC Docket No. 86&hyph;111, which requires that certain
telephone plant investments used for both regulated and nonregulated purposes be allocated on the basis of forecasted
regulated and nonregulated use. The detection and correction of forecasting errors requires reporting of both forecasted
and actual investment usage data. The Forecast of Investment Usage Report is used by carriers to submit the forecasts
of investments used. The Actual Usage of Investment Report is used to submit the actual investments used. These reports
are part of the Automated Reporting and Management Information System (ARMIS). The information contained in these
two reports provides the necessary detail to enable the Commission to fulfill its regulatory responsibility to ensure
that the regulated operations of the carriers do not subsidize the nonregulated operations of those same carriers.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The GSA will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the construction of a Border Station in Highgate Springs,
Vermont. The proposed Border Station will contain approximately 37,800 occupiable square feet of space and house
75 employees. The operations of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and U.S. Customs Service at the existing
Border Station in Highgate Springs are severely hindered due to the functional obsolescence of the existing facilities.
The proposed project is being undertaken to accommodate the expansion requirements of the U.S. Customs Service,
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EIS will evaluate alternatives, including the no-action alternative. The EIS will evaluate impacts on the affected
environment for the following resource areas: subsurface and geological conditions, landforms, vegetation and
wildlife, natural hazards, air quality/meteorological conditions, population/fiscal conditions, land use and
zoning, traffic and transportation, utilities, cultural resources, and hazardous wastes.

is to assure that individuals are not being denied categories of Federal assistance for which they are eligible and
to take necessary corrective measures to reduce the incidence of improperly authorized or denied assistance. Specifically,
categories of assistance covered by this collection of information are Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC)
and Medicaid in all States and jurisdictions, and Adult Assistance Programs under titles I, X, XIV, and XVI of the Social
Security Act in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Quality Control Negative Case Action system is a joint State/Federal effort to obtain data on the correctness
of State actions to deny or terminate AFDC/Adult financial assistance or Medicaid eligibility. This information
is utilized in determining the principal causes of incorrect actions and in developing appropriate corrective action.
The Quality Control Negative Case Action system promotes proper State administration of their AFDC and adult programs
by helping to assess performance in the denial or termination of benefits. Negative case action quality control therefor
provides: (a) Continuous review of a statistically reliable statewide samples of negative actions; and (b) periodic
compilation and analysis of findings to determine the incidence of incorrect actions. The Negative Case Action review
supplements the Quality Control review of active cases and, thus, provides a balanced quality control system capable
of measuring overall program performance.

The Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) is a component of the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF)
in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The Bureau administers five Federal programs dealing with
children, youth and families:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The mission of FYSB is to provide national leadership on youth issues and to empower individuals and organizations
to provide effective, comprehensive services for at-risk youth and their families, ensuring the safety and maximizing
the stability and long-term self-sufficiency of the youth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two of the FYSB programs listed above, the Runaway and Homeless Youth (Basic Center) Program and the Transitional
Living Program for Homeless Youth, are authorized under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (Title III of the Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended, hereinafter cited as ``the Act'') and are the subject
of the priorities proposed in this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act specifically authorizes the Secretary to make grants to entities that establish and operate local runaway
and homeless youth centers (Basic Centers) to address the immediate needs of at-risk youth. Currently, 348 such projects
are being funded. The Act also authorizes activities that support the local centers, and that increase knowledge
about the conditions of runaway and homeless youth and their families.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Act further authorizes the Secretary to make grants to entities that establish and operate Transitional Living
projects for homeless youth to enable the youth to become self-sufficient and to avoid long-term dependency on social
services. Currently, 73 such projects are being funded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also authorizes financial support for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A National Communications System (NCS, a toll-free 25-hour runaway hotline) which serves as a neutral channel
of communication between at-risk youth and their families and as a source of referral to needed services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Grants to statewide and regional non-profit organizations for the provision of Training and Technical Assistance
(T&amp;TA) to agencies and organizations eligible to establish and operate runaway and homeless youth centers;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Grants to conduct research, demonstration, and evaluation projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Annual Program Priorities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Sections 384(a) and 384(b) of the Act instruct the Secretary to develop for each fiscal year, and to publish annually
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for public comment, a proposed plan specifying the priorities the Department will follow in making grants under the
Basic Center and the Transitional Living Programs. The Secretary is further instructed to take into consideration
the comments received in developing and publishing the subsequent plan specifying the final fiscal year priorities.
This notice constitutes the Department's proposed priorities in these two program areas for fiscal year (FY) 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No acknowledgement will be made of the comments received in response to this notice, but all comments received by the
deadline will be considered in preparing the runaway and homeless youth final priorities. Final priorities will
be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at the time of solicitation of grant applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One program announcement soliciting applications for both Basic Center Program grants and Transitional Living
Program grants will appear in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as in previous years. Because all current grants to carry out training and technical assistance (T&amp;TA) activities
will expire this fiscal year, the announcement will also request proposals to provide T&amp;TA to staff of FYSB-funded
projects. Finally, the announcement will solicit grant proposals to analyze and interpret the considerable data
that are being produced by the Runaway and Homeless Youth Management Information System, the Runaway and Homeless
Youth Monitoring System, a number of Runaway and Homeless Youth Evaluation Studies, and recent Research and Demonstration
projects. Copies of the announcement will be sent to all persons who comment on these proposed priorities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Priorities for Basic Centers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approximately 350 Basic Center grants, of which about two-thirds will be non-competitive continuations and about
one-third competitive new starts, will be funded in FY 1994 to support organizations which provide services to fulfill
the four major goals of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program (RHYP): alleviating the problems of runaway and homeless
youth; reuniting youth with their families; strengthening family relationships; and helping youth decide upon
a future course of action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The goals of the RHYP are achieved through the Basic Centers, which provide services in support of the immediate needs
(temporary shelter, food, clothing, counseling, and related services) of runaway or homeless youth and their families
in a manner which is outside the law enforcement system, the child welfare system, the mental health system, and the
juvenile justice system. Further, the Basic Centers provide services, directly and through referrals, to promote
the long-term stability and safety of such youth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Funds for Basic Center grants are allotted annually among the States and other qualifying jurisdictions on the basis
of their relative populations of individuals who are less than 18 years of age. For the past several years, Basic Center
grants have been awarded for three-year project periods. Approximately one-third of the Basic Center grants expire
each year, requiring these agencies to compete for new awards. The remaining two-thirds of the Basic Center grants
receive non-competitive continuation awards. Within any given State, in consequence, individual grantees may
fall within any one of three different funding cycles: new starts, second-year continuations, and third-year continuations.
In FY 1994, this cyclical funding pattern will be continued, assuming satisfactory performance on the part of current
grantees and the availability of funds. Thus, approximately two-thirds of the current grantees will be awarded noncompetitive
continuation funds, and the remaining grantees (those whose grant periods expire in FY 1994) will have the opportunity
to submit new competitive applications. All other eligible youth-serving agencies not holding current awards may
also apply for these new competitive funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 385(a)(2) of the Act requires that not less than 90 percent of the funds appropriated under Part A (The Runaway
and Homeless Youth Grant Act) be used to establish and strengthen runaway and homeless youth Basic Centers. Total
funding under Part A of the Act for FY 1994 is expected to be approximately $36.1 million. Approximately $32.5 million
will be allocated to the Basic Centers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An announcement of the availability of funds for the Basic Centers, along with the instructions and forms needed to
prepare and submit applications, will be published in a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcement as early as possible in calendar year 1994 after the comment period ends.

B. Priorities for Transitional Living Grants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part B, Section 321 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, as amended, authorizes grants to establish and operate Transitional
Living projects for homeless youth. This program is structured to help older homeless youth achieve self-sufficiency
and avoid long-term dependency on social services. Transitional Living projects provide shelter, skills training,
and support services to homeless youth ages 16 through 21 for a continuous period not exceeding 18 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first 45 Transitional Living Program (TLP) grants were added in September 1990 for three-year project periods.
An additional 32 grants were awarded in FY 1991 and 10 grants in FY 1992, also for three-year project periods. All funds
available under this program in FY 1993 were awarded in the form of non-competitive continuation awards to then-ongoing
grantees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to award new TLP grants as early as possible in FY 1994, however, an open competition was held in the summer of
calendar year 1993 for new awards to be supported with FY 1994 funds. Project periods of the new grants were to begin
on October 1, 1994, or as soon thereafter as funds were available. This was to allow grantees with project periods ending
in September 1994 to compete for new grants and to continue their existing projects with minimal disruption of services
if they were successful in the competition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirty-two new TLP grants were awarded following the competition, with starting dates on or after October 1, 1993
(the first day of FY 1994). First-year funding for these projects totaled approximately $6.0 million. It is anticipated
that remaining FY 1994 TLP funds will be awarded to continuation grantees initially funded in earlier years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inasmuch as funds for additional new-start TLP grants will probably be available in FY 1995, an open competition will
be held in the summer of calendar year 1994 for new awards to be supported with FY 1995 funds. Project periods of these
new awards will begin no sooner than October 1, 1994. It is anticipated that approximately $6.0 million will be available
for these new grants in FY 1995.

C. Priorities for the National Communications System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part C, Section 331 of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, as amended, mandates support for a National Communications
System to assist runaway and homeless youth in communicating with their families and with service providers. In FY
1991, a three-year grant was awarded to the National Runaway Switchboard, Inc., in Chicago, Illinois, to operate
the system. This grant will expire in February 1994. An announcement soliciting competing grant applications to
operate the system for five years will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 late in 1993 or early in 1994. Priority will be given to applicants having experience in providing telephone services
to runaway and homeless youth. It is anticipated that $826,900 in first-year funds will be awarded to the grantee in
FY 1994.

A. Training and Technical Assistance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part D, Section 342 of the Act authorizes the Department to make grants to statewide and regional nonprofit organizations
to provide training and technical assistance (T&amp;TA) to organizations that are eligible to receive service grants
under the Act. Organizations eligible to receive this T&amp;TA include the Basic Centers authorized under Part A
of the Act and the Transitional Living grantees authorized under Part B. In addition, Section 3511 of the Anti-Drug
Abuse Act of 1988, which authorized the Drug Abuse Prevention Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth (DAPP), authorizes
support for T&amp;TA to runaway and homeless youth service providers. The purpose of this T&amp;TA is to strengthen
the programs and to enhance the knowledge and skills of youth service workers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1991, the Family and Youth Services Bureau awarded ten Cooperative Agreements, one in each of the ten Federal
Regions, to provide T&amp;TA to agencies funded under the three Federal programs for runaway and homeless youth (the
Basic Center Program, the Transitional Living Program, and the Drug Abuse Prevention Program). Each Cooperative
Agreement was unique, being based on the characteristics and different T&amp;TA needs in the respective Regions.
Each of the Cooperative Agreements had a three-year project period that will expire in FY 1994.

early in 1994. Earlier cooperative agreements allowed support for networking and membership efforts. We are proposing
that these activities not be continued under the new agreements. Instead, we are proposing that the agreements provide
for T&amp;TA focused on findings resulting from the monitoring of runaway and homeless youth grantees. Grantee project
periods will be for five years, and approximately $1.5 million in first-year funds will be available in FY 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In June 1992, a five-year contract was awarded by the Department to establish and operate the National Clearinghouse
on Runaway and Homeless Youth. The purpose of the Clearinghouse is to serve as a central information point for professionals
and agencies involved in the development and implementation of services to runaway and homeless youth. To this end,
the Clearinghouse:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In FY 1992, a five-year contract was awarded to implement the Runaway and Homeless Youth Management Information System
(MIS) across three FYSB programs: the Runaway and Homeless Youth Basic Center Program, the Transitional Living Program,
and the Drug Abuse Prevention Program. The MIS data elements include identification of the program in which the youth
is enrolled, a profile on each youth served (demographics, presenting problems, services received), and an agency
profile (agency description, program information, staff profile, and related information). Participation in
the MIS is mandatory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1993, using an existing computer-based, information gathering protocol, the contractor began providing training
and technical assistance to grantees in the use of the MIS. The system will become fully operational by the end of FY
1994. The data generated by the system will be used to produce reports and information regarding the programs, including
information for the required reports to Congress on each of the three programs. The MIS is also designed to serve as
a management tool for FYSB and for the individual programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that continuation funding for the MIS will be provided in FY 1994.

D. Monitoring Support for FYSB Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In FY 1992, FYSB awarded a contract for initial development of a comprehensive monitoring instrument and set of site
visit protocols, including a peer-review component, for the Runaway and Homeless Youth Basic Center Program, the
Transitional Living Program, and the Drug Abuse Prevention Program. Pilot testing of the instrument and related
protocols began in FY 1993. Also in FY 1993 an expanded contract was awarded to provide nationwide logistical support
for the peer review monitoring process. The projected nationwide use of the new instrument and peer review process
will improve Federal oversight of the programs and will identify program strengths and weaknesses. The findings
will also be used to direct T&amp;TA activities and FYSB policy development.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 343 of the Act authorizes the Department to make grants to States, localities, and private entities to carry
out research, demonstration, and service projects designed to increase knowledge concerning and to improve services
for runaway and homeless youth. These activities are important in order to identify emerging issues and to develop
and test models which address such issues.

A. Services for Youth in Rural Areas
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of geographic distances, low population density and, in some cases, cultural differences, it is difficult
to provide effective services to runaway and homeless youth in rural areas. In many such areas, scarcity of funds and
other resources precludes the funding of separate, autonomous Basic Center programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a need for innovative and effective models for the provision of runaway and homeless youth services in rural
areas, including Indian reservations. These models would make services accessible to youth without setting up inordinately
expensive service agencies in low populated areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1993, first-year funding was awarded to eight grantees to develop such models. These grants are expected to produce
written descriptions of the proposed service models, identify issues related to model implementation, and generate
information on youth and program outcomes. The models will also incorporate formal collaboration with other major
youth-serving agencies in the areas served.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that continuation funding of these eight grants will be provided in FY 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the past few years, systems for the accumulation of new knowledge have been developed regarding the delivery
of services to runaway and homeless youth and their families through programs administered by FYSB. These systems
currently provide, or during FY 1994 will provide, new data of considerable interest. The four main sources of this
new information are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Management Information System (MIS)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The information now being collected by the MIS includes descriptions of FYSB's grantee agencies and detailed data
on the youth and families served, including demographic profiles, presenting problems, services provided, and
service outcomes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. The Monitoring System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data now being collected through the monitoring system will identify program strengths and weaknesses in such areas
as outreach and intake; provision of appropriate shelter, food, clothing, and counseling; making of referrals,
as needed, for health care, employment, and educational services; family reunification and aftercare; and program
administration.

There is need for analysis, synthesis, and interpretation of this new information, leading to the identification
of issues and trends in regard to both the client population served and the services being provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information will be used to initiate a dialogue with the field around current program requirements, practices,
and concerns, and to identify needed changes in the manner in which FYSB programs are funded and implemented. For example,
directors of FYSB grantee agencies and Federal officials have raised a number of program and management issues that
an analysis, synthesis and interpretation of the emerging data will help clarify and prioritize. These issues include
youth eligibility for FYSB's Runaway and Homeless Youth programs, fees for services, consolidation of Runaway and
Homeless Youth programs, availability of physical and mental health care for runaway and homeless youth, and State
and local laws affecting runaway and homeless youth programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Readers are invited to suggest other areas in which program guidance is needed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This Ruling concerns whether the 30-day period for filing an application for attorney's fees under the Equal Access
to Justice Act (EAJA) begins immediately upon expiration of the time for appeal of a remand order issued by a court under
sentence four of section 205(g) of the Social Security Act (the Act), or after the administrative proceedings on remand
are complete. Sentence four states, ``[t]he court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and transcript of
the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversing the decision of the Secretary, with or without remanding
the cause for a rehearing.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The claimant filed for and was denied title II disability benefits. The claimant sought review in district court under
section 205(g) of the Act. Reversing the Secretary, the district court held that the Secretary had erred in her decision
on this case and remanded the case under sentence four of section 205(g) of the Act to the Secretary for further consideration.
The Secretary subsequently awarded benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
More than a year later, the claimant filed a petition for attorney's fees under the EAJA. The Secretary, in response,
noted that the claimant was required to file the petition for EAJA fees ``within 30 days of final judgment in the action''
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(1)(B), and argued that the ``final judgment'' in this case was the administrative decision
on remand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The district court relied on

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Schaefer 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
to the circuit court, the court declined the Secretary's suggestion for

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, a district court cannot retain jurisdiction of a case after a remand under sentence four of section 205(g) of the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court's decision to award EAJA fees, it rejected its analysis. The
Court held that, under the clear language of section 205(g) of the Act, a district court may not retain jurisdiction
after a sentence four remand. The Court found that a sentence four remand is an appealable final judgment of the district
court that terminates the action and makes a plaintiff a ``prevailing party'' for the purposes of the EAJA. The Court
clarified dicta in

, emphasizing that a sentence four remand (as opposed to a remand under sentence six of section 205(g), in which the
court retains jurisdiction of the case) confers prevailing party status on the plaintiff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Court also clarified that, in a sentence four remand, the time period in which an EAJA petition must be filed begins
at the conclusion of the appeal period following the district court's entry of a judgment. However, in this case, the
Court found that, because the district court failed to enter a judgment pursuant to Rule 58 of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, neither the appeal period nor the EAJA 30-day filing period had lapsed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the foregoing reasons, the Court affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This case concerns the proper timing of an application for attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA)
in a Social Security case. Under 42 U.S.C. 405(g), a claimant has the right to seek judicial review of a final decision
of the Secretary of Health and Human Services denying Social Security benefits. One possible outcome of such a suit
is that the district court, pursuant to sentence four of section 405(g), will enter ``a judgment *&blank;*&blank;*
reversing the decision of the Secretary *&blank;*&blank;* (and) remanding the cause for a rehearing.'' The issue
here is whether the 30-day period for filing an application for EAJA fees begins immediately upon expiration of the
time for appeal of such a ``sentence-four remand order,'' or sometime after the administrative proceedings on remand
are complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1986, respondent Richard Schaefer filed an application for disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security
Act, 49 Stat. 622, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1988 ed. and Supp. III). He was denied benefits at the administrative level, and sought judicial review by filing
suit against the Secretary as authorized by section 405(g). Schaefer and the Secretary filed cross-motions for summary
judgment. On April 4, 1989, the District Court held that the Secretary had committed three errors in ruling on Schaefer's
case and entered an order stating that ``the Secretary's decision denying disability insurance benefits to [Schaefer]
is reversed, that the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are denied, and that the case is remanded to the
Secretary for further consideration in light of this Order.'' App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with this order, Schaefer's application for benefits was reconsidered at the administrative level,
and was granted. On July 18, 1990, Schaefer returned to the District Court and filed an application for attorney's
fees pursuant to EAJA. In response, the Secretary noted that Schaefer was required to file any application for EAJA
fees ``within thirty days of final judgment in the action,'' 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(1)(B), and argued that the relevant
``final judgment'' in the case was the administrative decision on remand, which had become final on April 2, 1990.
The District Court stayed action on Schaefer's EAJA application pending this Court's imminent ruling in

 the Secretary changed positions to argue that EAJA's 30-day clock began running when the District Court's April 4,
1989 order (not the administrative ruling on remand) became final, which would have occurred at the end of the 60 days
for appeal provided under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a). Thus, the Secretary concluded, Schaefer's time
to file his EAJA application expired on July 3, 1989, over a year before the application was filed. The District Court,
however, found Schaefer's EAJA application timely under the controlling circuit precedent of

and remanded the case to the Secretary for further proceedings.

 He argues, however, that a district court proceeding under that provision need not enter a judgment at the time of remand,
but may postpone it and retain jurisdiction pending completion of the administrative proceedings. That argument,
however, is inconsistent with the plain language of sentence four, which authorizes a district court to enter a judgment
``with or without'' a remand order, not a remand order ``with or without'' a judgment.

Nor is it possible to argue that the judgment authorized by sentence four, if it includes a remand, does not become a
``final judgment''_as required by section 2412(d)_upon expiration of the time for appeal. If that were true, there
would never be any final judgment in cases reversed and remanded for further agency proceedings (including those
which suffer that fate after the Secretary has filed the results of a sentence-six remand). Sentence eight of section
405(g) states that ``(t)he judgment of the court''_which must be a reference to a sentence-four judgment, since that
is the only judgment authorized by section 405(g)_``shall be final except that it shall be subject to review in the
same manner as a judgment in other civil actions.'' Thus, when the time for seeking appellate review has run, the sentence-four
judgment fits squarely within the term ``final judgment'' as used in section 2412(d), which is defined to mean ``a
judgment that is final and not appealable.'' 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(G). We described the law with complete accuracy

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

490 U.S. 877, 892, 109 S.Ct. 2248, 2257, 104 L.Ed.2d 941, (1989), which held that fees incurred during administrative
proceedings held pursuant to a district court's remand order could be recovered under EAJA. In order ``to effectuate

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hudson,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' Schaefer contends, a district court entering a sentence-four remand order may properly hold its judgment in abeyance
(and thereby delay the start of EAJA's 30-day clock) until postremand administrative proceedings are complete;
otherwise, as far as fees incurred during the yet-to-be-held administrative proceedings are concerned, the claimant
would be unable to comply with the requirement of section 2412(d)(1)(B) that the fee application include ``the amount
sought'' and ``an itemized statement *&blank;*&blank;* [of] the actual time expended'' by attorneys and experts.
In response, the Secretary argues that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hudson 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
applies only to cases remanded pursuant to sentence six of section 405(g), where there is no final judgment and the
clock does not begin to run. The difficulty with that, Schaefer contends, is that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hudson itself 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
clearly involved a sentence-four remand. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the last point, Schaefer is right. Given the facts recited by the Court in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hudson
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the remand order there could have been authorized only under sentence four. See 490 U.S., at 880&hyph;881, 109 S.Ct.,at
2252; cf. n. 2, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
supra. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, the facts in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hudson
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 also show that the District Court had not terminated the case, but had retained jurisdiction during the remand. And
that was a central element in our decision, as the penultimate sentence of the opinion shows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We conclude that where a court orders a remand to the Secretary in a benefits litigation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
and retains continuing jurisdiction over the case pending a decision from the Secretary which will determine the
claimant's entitlement to benefits, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
the proceedings on remand are an integral part of the ``civil action'' for judicial review, and thus attorney's fees
for representation on remand are available subject to the other limitations in the EAJA. 490 U.S., at 892, 109 S.Ct.,
at 2258 (emphasis added).

Finkelstein, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 The Secretary not only failed to object to the District Court's retention of jurisdiction, but affirmatively endorsed
the practice as a means of accommodating the lower court cases holding that a section 405(g) plaintiff does not become

Schaefer's second argument is that a sentence-four remand order cannot be considered a ``final judgment'' for purposes
of section 2412(d)(1)(B) because that provision requires the party seeking fees to submit an application ``show[ing]
that [he] is a prevailing party.'' That showing, Schaefer contends, cannot be made until the proceedings on remand
are complete, since a Social Security claimant does not ``prevail'' until he is awarded Social Security benefits.
The premise of this argument is wrong. No holding of this Court has ever denied prevailing-party status (under section
2412(d)(1)(B)) to a plaintiff who won a remand order pursuant to sentence four of section 405(g). Dicta in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hudson
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 stated that ``a Social Security claimant would not, as a general matter, be a prevailing party within the meaning of
the EAJA merely because a court had remanded the action to the agency for further proceedings.'' 490 U.S., at 887, 109
S.Ct., at 2255. But that statement (like the holding of the case) simply failed to recognize the distinction between
a sentence-four remand, which terminates the litigation with victory for the plaintiff, and a sentence-six remand,
which does not. The sharp distinction between the two types of remand had not been made in the lower-court opinions

Finally, Schaefer argues that, even if the District Court should have entered judgment in connection with its April
4, 1989 order remanding the case to the Secretary, the fact remains that it did not. And since no judgment was entered,
he contends, the 30-day time period for filing an application for EAJA fees cannot have run. We agree. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An EAJA application may be filed until 30 days after a judgment becomes ``not appealable''_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

a federal officer is a party, the time for appeal does not end until 60 days after ``entry of judgment,'' and that a judgment
is considered entered for purposes of the rule only if it has been ``entered in compliance with Rul[e] 58 *&blank;*&blank;*

Since the District Court's April 4 remand order was a final judgment, see ante
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

done. The Secretary does not dispute that, but argues that a formal ``separate document'' of judgment is not needed

Absent a formal judgment, the District Court's April 4 order remained ``appealable'' at the time that Schaefer filed

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 supplemental
funds for current awardees of the National/Regional Minority Organizations (NRMO) program to provide technical
assistance and training to community planning groups and the State and local health departments working with them
to facilitate representation, inclusiveness, and parity in the implementation of HIV-prevention community planning.
This competitive announcement is an addendum to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 4, 1993 [58 FR 31721], in which current recipients are collaborating with community organizations and health
agencies to coordinate technical assistance and training programs that serve racial and ethnic minority populations.
Approximately $750,000 is expected to be available for a one-time award in FY 1994 to supplement up to 5 cooperative
agreements. The awards are not expected to exceed $150,000 each and will not be funded beyond the current budget period.
It is expected that these supplemental awards will be made on or about February 28, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this addendum to Program Announcement 305 is to provide State and local health departments and other
community organizations with the necessary technical assistance and training to: (1) Assure that inclusion, representation,
and parity occur in the community planning process; and (2) Enhance selection processes for equitable representation
in HIV prevention planning activities, thereby enhancing the capacity of affected communities and non-governmental
organizations to participate effectively and equally in the planning process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CDC shall be responsible for coordinating all requests for technical assistance and training between the NRMO
and the community organizations (via State and local health departments) that are requiring the technical assistance;
providing consultation and technical assistance in planning, operating, and evaluating program activities under
this announcement; assisting in developing plans for evaluation of all program activities and services and interpreting
evaluation findings; assisting successful applicants in collaborating with State and local health departments
and other PHS grantees; facilitating the transfer of successful prevention interventions and program models to
other areas; monitoring the successful applicant's program activities, protection of client confidentiality,
and compliance with other requirements; and facilitating the exchange of program information and technical assistance
among community organizations, health departments, and NRMOs.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing the availability of the ``Food Code: 1993 Recommendations of
the United States Public Health Service/Food and Drug Administration'' (the 1993 Food Code). The 1993 Food Code consists
of model requirements for regulating the retail segment of the food industry to safeguard public health and to ensure
that the food is not adulterated and is honestly presented when offered to the consumer. The 1993 Food Code updates,
combines, and replaces three separate preceding models: The 1976 Food Service Sanitation Code; the 1978 Food and
Beverage Vending Code; and the 1982 Retail Food Store Sanitation Code. It covers management and personnel; food;
equipment, utensils, and linens; water, plumbing, and waste; physical facilities; poisonous or toxic materials;
and compliance and enforcement. This project was initiated at the recommendation of the Conference for Food Protection
(the Conference).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is responsible under section 311 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243) and 21 CFR 5.10(a)(2) and (a)(4),
and the statutory provisions cited therein, for providing assistance to State and local governmental jurisdictions
with respect to the prevention of communicable disease and the enforcement of their public health regulations. For
many years, FDA has used model food codes as one means of assisting the several thousand Federal, State, and local agencies
that have primary responsibility for regulating retail-level food establishments such as restaurants, institutions,
grocery stores, and food vending locations. The model codes that FDA has prepared are not Federal laws or regulations
and are not preemptive but are widely referenced, adopted, and applied at all levels of government. FDA periodically
updates and reissues the model codes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has determined that a new model food code revision is necessary for the retail segment of the food industry because
new technologies are being applied by the industry; new information about the nature, contributing factors, and
means of preventing foodborne illness have become available; and new approaches to inspection have been developed
since FDA last revised its three existing model codes on retail food. FDA has also concluded that there was a need to
combine the provisions of these codes into a single document because the traditional lines of demarcation between
the types of food operations covered by each of the separate codes, as well as between food service firms versus food
stores, have largely disappeared. Pursuant to this determination, FDA issued a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 13, 1987 (52 FR 11885), that announced the agency's plan to revise the retail food codes. In that notice, FDA
cited the problems that States were having with the model codes and the opportunities offered by a new unified code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 9, 1988 (53 FR 16472), FDA announced the availability for comment of a draft model Food Protection Unicode that
would update and combine the food protection and sanitation provisions contained in the separate model codes covering
food service, food vending, and retail food stores. Interested persons were given until August 8, 1988, to comment.
FDA subsequently extended the comment period until October 7, 1988 (53 FR 29953, August 9, 1988), in response to requests
from three trade associations, one State agency, and the Conference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA received over 150 letters, each containing 1 or more comments, in response to the draft model Food Protection Unicode.
FDA considered each of the comments and modified the document as appropriate based on the information that it received.
Among the comments that FDA considered were those of the Conference, which were submitted after the Conference's
1992 meeting in Baltimore, MD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1993 Food Code provides definitions of terms; standards for management and personnel, food operations, equipment,
and facilities; and guidance on food establishment plan review, permit issuance, inspection, restriction of infected
food employees, holding and examination of food, and permit suspension. This new combined model code also includes:
(1) New provisions covering management responsibilities and knowledge and employee health and practices; (2) a
new framework for the application of hazard analysis critical control point principles at the retail level; (3) a
variance procedure for approving food processing at the retail level; (4) enhanced and more flexible criteria for
safe time/temperature management of potentially hazardous foods; (5) new provisions pertaining to consumer information
and public disclosure; and (6) more comprehensive code enforcement provisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program Background and Objectives 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Pediatric AIDS Demonstration Program was initiated in 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The program grew from 13 projects funded at $4.4 million to a total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 44 projects funded at $20.8 in 1993. Since 1988, the program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has evolved from a primary focus on the coordination of services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the management and care of infected children and their families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to also address the broader prevention and care needs of youth and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women affected by the HIV infection, AIDS or related conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In FY 1994, Congress funded the Pediatric AIDS Demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program under Title IV of the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Resources Emergency (CARE) Act (Title IV). The program will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanently authorized in section 2671 of the Public Health Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act. Title IV authorizes demonstration grants to organizations to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide comprehensive services and enhance access to clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research trials for children, youth, women, and families with or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by HIV infection. As a result of this transfer to Title 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IV, the focus of the program is further expanded to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
innovative models that link systems of comprehensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary/community-based medical and social services for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected population with NIH and other clinical research trials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The purpose of the funding is to improve and expand the system of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive care services for children, youth, women, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families who are infected with or affected by HIV and AIDS and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
link comprehensive care systems with clinical research. Funds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorized and appropriated under Title IV will be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate and test potentially replicable models of service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivery and clinical research to respond to the unique and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
challenging problems of access to a comprehensive care system faced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by HIV and AIDS affected children, youth, women, and families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While children, youth, and women represent the most rapidly growing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population groups affected by HIV and AIDS, they also represent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
groups facing the greatest barriers in accessing care and research. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These groups disproportionately are minorities and living in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
poverty. Children, youth, and women have a complex array of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic and social problems that increase their need for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive services and increase the cost and intensity of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, since they comprise the most recent and fastest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
growing population groups impacted by HIV and AIDS, the care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infrastructure and provider capacity are often not developed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require targeted resources and efforts to develop an appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given these unmet needs, activities under the demonstration grants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should address the following goals: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=2 -->
_Foster the development of comprehensive care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infrastructures, including primary care, that increase access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
culturally-competent, family-centered, community-based, coordinated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Emphasize prevention within the comprehensive care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system in order to reduce the spread of the HIV infection to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vulnerable populations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Funding Categories 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Two categories of projects will be funded in FY 1994. Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which do not fall within these program categories will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first category of grants, the HIV Demonstration Projects for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Children, Adolescents, and Families, continues development of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive care demonstrations, including efforts to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
innovative models that foster collaboration between clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research institutions and family-centered primary/community-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical and social service programs for children, youth, women and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their families. Projects will focus on local capacity-building, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making maximum use of all available public and private resources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for reaching and providing health care and supportive services to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the target population. Projects should strengthen the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infrastructure for the comprehensive system of care by broadening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the coalition of agencies, providers, community organizations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
families participating in services planning, coordination, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financing. These include other appropriate Federal, State, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local programs serving children with special health care needs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Title V Maternal and Child Health programs, hemophilia 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment centers, Ryan White Title I, II and III programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration (SAMSHA) and Centers for Disease Control and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prevention (CDC), and other programs serving the target population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e.g., Medicaid, developmental disabilities, special education) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providers, payers, organizations, and support groups in the private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector with a similar focus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Preference for funding in this category will be given to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competing renewal of currently funded Pediatric/Family AIDS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Demonstration projects serving children, youth, women, and families 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infected with or affected by the HIV infection which demonstrate an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established model of a comprehensive and coordinated system of care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is culturally-competent, family-centered, and community-based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This means that these projects will be funded ahead of new groups 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of applications in this category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second category of funding will be used to initiate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of comprehensive care systems for HIV affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children, adolescents and families in cities or states where there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no currently funded pediatric health care demonstration project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nor well organized care system for the target population and where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are barriers to access to care and clinical research trials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants for funding in this category will be supported for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial planning activities to develop their infrastructure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comprehensive care with the ultimate goal of a mature demonstration of family-centered, community-based coordinated
care described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category (1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The MCHB places special emphasis on improving service delivery to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
women and children from culturally identifiable populations who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been disproportionately affected by barriers to accessible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care. This means that projects are expected to serve and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriately involve in project activities members of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ethnoculturally distinct groups, unless there are compelling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programmatic or other justifications for not doing so. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau's intent is to ensure that project interventions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outcomes are of benefit to culturally distinct populations and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insure that the broadest possible representation of culturally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinct and historically under-represented groups is supported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through programs and projects sponsored by the MCHB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will review applications for funds under the above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mentioned categories as competing applications and, with particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attention to inclusion of women and persons from culturally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinct populations, will fund those which, in the Department's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
view, best meet the statutory purposes of the HIV Demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program for Children, Adolescents, and Families and address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achievement of the Healthy People 2000 objectives related to HIV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infection.

planning agencies, as implemented by 45 CFR part 100. Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12372 allows States the option of setting up a system for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing applications from within their States for assistance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under certain Federal programs. The application packages to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports promotes and encourages the development of physical fitness
and sports programs for all Americans. In 1990, as part of its agenda, the PCPFS initiated the first Great American
Workout as a major event to focus on exercise. A second and third workout were held in 1991 and 1992 respectively. The
south lawn of the White House served as the backdrop for this fitness event for the Nation. The Great American Workout
for this year is scheduled to take place on May 2, 1994, pending approval from the White House.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Evaluation Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The events planning organization will be selected by the PCPFS, following a review of the proposals, based on the following
review criteria:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Organization's qualifications and capabilities to perform duties that are required for events of this nature;
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Adequacy of current staff to perform all required duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The ability of the organization to arrange for the funding of the event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the selection of the events planning organization, the PCPFS staff will meet separately with those organizations
whose written submissions best meet the evaluation criteria. Since it is anticipated that the Great American Workout
will involve events held on the grounds of the White House, certain restrictions apply to the commercial use of an events
planning organization's source or sources of funding. The successful organization will be required to enter into
a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Health and Human Services setting forth the details of the event.
In addition, agreements with other interested parties may be required. Participation by any organization or source
of funding may in no way be construed as an endorsement of any commercial product by the PCPFS.

This notice announces changes in the interest rates to be paid on debentures issued with respect to a loan or mortgage
insured by the Federal Housing Commissioner under the provisions of the National Housing Act (the ``Act''). The interest
rate for debentures issued under section 221(g)(4) of the Act during the six-month period beginning January 1, 1994,
is 53/4 percent. The interest rate for debentures issued under any other provision of the Act is the rate in effect on
the date that the commitment to insure the loan or mortgage was issued, or the date that the loan or mortgage was endorsed
(or initially endorsed if there are two or more endorsements) for insurance, whichever rate is higher. The interest
rate for debentures issued under these other provisions with respect to a loan or mortgage committed or endorsed during
the six-month period beginning January 1, 1994, is 65/8 percent.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 224 of the National Housing Act (24 U.S.C. 1715o) provides that debentures issued under the Act with respect
to an insured loan or mortgage (except for debentures issued pursuant to section 221(g)(4) of the Act) will bear interest
at the rate in effect on the date the commitment to insure the loan or mortgage was issued, or the date the loan or mortgage
was endorsed (or initially endorsed if there are two or more endorsements) for insurance, whichever rate is higher.
This provision is implemented in HUD's regulations at 24 CFR 203.405, 203.479, 207.259(e)(6), and 220.830. Each
of these regulatory provisions states that the applicable rates of interest will be published twice each year as a
notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Section 224 further provides that the interest rate on these debentures will be set from time to time by the Secretary
of HUD, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, in an amount not in excess of the interest rate determined
by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to a formula set out in the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary of the Treasury (1) has determined, in accordance with the provisions of Section 224, that the statutory
maximum interest rate for the period beginning January 1, 1994, is 65/8 percent and (2) has approved the establishment
of the debenture interest rate by the Secretary of HUD at 65/8 percent for the six-month period beginning January 1,
1994. This interest rate will be the rate borne by debentures issued with respect to any insured loan or mortgage (except
for debentures issued pursuant to Section 221(g)(4)) with an insurance commitment or endorsement date (as applicable)
within the first six months of 1994.

Section 221(g)(4) of the Act provides that debentures issued pursuant to that paragraph (with respect to the assignment
of an insured mortgage to the Secretary) will bear interest at the ``going Federal rate'' in effect at the time the debentures
are issued. The term ``going Federal rate'', as used in that paragraph, is defined to mean the interest rate that the
Secretary of the Treasury determines, pursuant to a formula set out in the statute, for the six-month periods of January
through June and July through December of each year. Section 221(g)(4) is implemented in the HUD regulations at 24
CFR 221.790.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary of the Treasury has determined that the interest rate to be borne by debentures issued pursuant to Section
221(g)(4) during the six-month period beginning January 1, 1994, is 53/4 percent.

In the Dillon MFP, it was decided that selective aerial predator control be the only means by which predatory animals,
other than wolves be removed from the BLM land between the town of Lima and Bloody Dick Creek. The rationale was that
the most positive indication of gray wolf occupancy recorded at that time had been documented in the Lemhi Pass area.
Since then, however, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has better defined occupied wolf habitat in Montana.
The area between Lima and Blood Dick Creek is not considered occupied wolf habitat at this time. The proposed Dillon
MFP Amendment would have allowed for Integrated Pest Management in the described area, where predator control was
limited to aerial shooting of predators. However, due to the preparation of an RMP in the Dillon Resource Area beginning
in 1997, the Butte District has decided to cancel their intent to amend the Dillon MFP and review the decision on an ecosystem-wide
basis as part of the Dillon RMP.

The subject lands were previously identified for acquisition in the plan amendment designating ACECs for protection
of Aase's onion and determining the management prescriptions under which the lands are to be managed. The subject
lands will be added to the designated ACEC and will be managed with the same restrictions as the other public lands within
the ACEC to protect the critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The value of the lands to be exchanged will be approximately equal; some of the above-described public lands may not
be included and some of the private lands may not be acquired in order to equalize values and protect resource values.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of the land exchange is to allow BLM to acquire riparian land which is in good condition and identified as
prime bald eagle habitat. The public land selected by the proponent would enhance his livestock operation and is currently
difficult for BLM to manage because of the land pattern. The exchange is consistent with the Bureau of Land Management
land use plans, and the public interest will be well served by making this exchange. The exchange will include surface
and mineral estates.

On December 13, 15, and 15, Umatilla Deputy Forest Supervisor, John P. Kline, Wallowa-Whitman Forest Supervisor,
R.M. Richmond, and Baker Resource Acting Area Manager, Dorothy Mason, respectively, made a joint decision to amend

This plan identifies use levels, facility development levels, resource protection measures, and set the general
management direction for managing the Wallowa/Grande Ronde River, including the designated Grande Ronde Wild and
Scenic segment. This amendment is necessary to implement the Omnibus Oregon Wild and Scenic Rivers Act which required
the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to develop a management plan for the Grande Ronde River. Interim direction
was identified in the Forest Plans and Resource Management Plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The environmental assessment documents the analysis of alternatives for managing the Grande Ronde Wild Scenic River
in accordance with the Omnibus Oregon Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Umatilla and Wallwoa-Whitman National Forest, this decision is subject to appeal pursuant to Forest Service
regulations 36 CFR part 217. The 45 day appeal period begins February 1, 1994 and ends March 17, 1994. Notices of Appeals
must meet the requirements of 36 CFR 217.9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Bureau of Land Management, this decision is subject to protest pursuant to bureau of Land Management regulations
43 CFR part 4. The 45 day protest period begins February 1, 1994 and ends March 17, 1994. Notices of Protest must meet

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, TIAS 8249, hereinafter referred
to as CITES, is an international treaty designed to control and regulate international trade in certain animal and
plant species which are or may become threatened with extinction, and are listed in Appendices to the Convention (and
are available from the Office of Management Authority at the address, above). Currently, 120 countries, including
the United States, are CITES Parties. CITES calls for biennial meetings of the Conference of the Parties (COP) which
review its implementation, make provisions enabling the CITES Secretariat in Switzerland to carry out its functions,
consider amendments to the list of species in Appendices I and II, consider reports presented by the Secretariat,
and make recommendations for the improved effectiveness of the Convention.

Provisional Agenda for COP9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service will participate in the 31st meeting of the CITES Standing Committee, and by this notice calls for a public
meeting to discuss the agenda for this meeting and items of concern for COP9. A copy of the agenda for the Standing Committee
meeting, scheduled for March 21&hyph;25, 1994, is available from the Office of Management Authority (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is expected that resolutions will be submitted by one or more Parties dealing with many of these agenda items. Resolutions
can only be submitted by Parties, and must be submitted to the Secretariat by June 10, 1994. With this notice, the United
States begins the process of receiving input from the public on possible resolutions the United States may submit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Report on national reports under Article VIII, paragraph 7, of the Convention: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each Party is required by the Convention to submit an annual report containing a summary of the permits it has granted,
and the types and numbers of specimens of species in the CITES Appendices that it has imported and exported. The U.S.
CITES Annual reports are available from the Office of Management Authority (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, above). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Review of alleged infractions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretariat prepares an Infractions Report for each meeting of the Conference of the Parties, which details instances
that species listed in the Appendices are being adversely affected by trade or the Convention is not being effectively
implemented, or actions by Party countries that undermine the effectiveness of the Convention. The COP8 Infractions
Report highlighted those cases of the most serious infractions, in order to focus the attention of the Parties; the
COP9 Infractions Report is expected to do the same. A future 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice will notify the public of the availability of the Infractions Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Exports of leopard hunting trophies and skins: This refers to the importation of leopard skins, including hunting
trophies, under a quota system approved by the Conference of the Parties.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Trade in specimens of species transferred to Appendix II subject to annual export quotas: This refers to species
of crocodilians listed in Appendix I, which have populations that have been transferred to Appendix II pursuant to
annual export quotas, which are voted upon by the Conference of the Parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Trade in rhinoceros products: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This refers to the illegal trade in rhino horn, principally for the Asian medicinal market. The problem has been discussed
at the last two Standing Committee meetings, will be discussed at the March 21&hyph;25 Standing Committee meeting
(SC31) and is expected to be an issue of particular concern to the Parties and a subject of discussion at COP9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Trade in tiger products: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This refers to the illegal trade in tiger parts and products, principally for the Asian medicinal market. The problem
has been discussed at the last two Standing Committee meetings, will be discussed at the March 21&hyph;25 Standing
Committee meeting (SC31) and is expected to be an issue of particular concern to the Parties and a subject of discussion
at COP9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Proposed new criteria for listing species on the Appendices: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At COP8 in Kyoto, the Standing Committee was instructed to examine the current criteria used in listing species on
the Appendices. A Joint Committee Meeting of the Animals, Plants, and Standing Committees met in Brussels, in September
1993, and drafted a resolution for possible revision of the current CITES listing criteria (Resolutions 1.1 and 1.2,
the so-called ``Berne Criteria''), based on a document prepared for the Parties by IUCN, the World Conservation Union.
At SC31, The Standing Committee will review comments received from the Parties and possibly complete a revised draft
resolution for the consideration of the Parties at COP9. Extensive discussion of this revised draft resolution,
and the entire issue of criteria for listing species in the Appendices, will take place at COP9. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Trade in birds: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The trade in live wild-caught birds is an issue of great concern to both the United States and the CITES Parties, in that
the trade in many species of birds listed in Appendix II may be detrimental to their survival. The U.S. now prohibits
the import into the U.S. of birds listed on CITES Appendix II unless the Secretary of the Interior finds that such trade
will not endanger the survival of the species, based on the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992. The Service is not certain
whether this item will be placed on the agenda by any Party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Trade in crocodilian products: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This refers to work by the Animals Committee to institute a system of universal marking for all crocodilian skins in
trade, as a response to serious problems of illegal trade in crocodilian skins, parts, and products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Trade in plant specimens: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nursery registration for artificially propagated Appendix I species, among other issues relating to plant species,
will most likely be discussed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Significant trade in Appendix II species: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This refers to the trade in those Appendix II species identified as subject to significant trade, for which insufficient
biological information exists to warrant trade at current levels. Resolution Conf. 8.9 dealt with this topic, and
established a procedure for review of the status of significantly traded species, and the implementation of Article
IV of the Convention by the exporting countries involved. It is anticipated that this topic will be placed on the agenda
for COP9 as well. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Standardization of CITES permits and certificates: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This refers to the development of harmonized CITES permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Transport of live specimens: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This refers to a report by the Working Group on Transport of Live Specimens, which is chaired by the U.S. Office of Management
Authority. The Transport Working Group met in 1993 in Senegal to assess the implementation of requirements in the
CITES treaty that live animals be prepared without injury, damage to health, or cruel treatment. One or more Parties
that have been active in the Working Group may propose a resolution for the Conference of the Parties dealing with species
subject to high mortality rates in transport.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once admitted, these observers shall have the right to participate but not to vote. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons wishing to be observers representing United States national non-governmental organizations must receive
prior approval of the Fish and Wildlife Service. After granting of that approval, a national non-governmental organization
is eligible to register with the CITES Secretariat to participate in the COP as an observer. Requests for such approval
should include evidence of technical qualification in protection, conservation or management of wild fauna and
flora, on the part of both the organization and the individual representative. Organizations previously approved
by the Service shall submit a request but do not need to provide as detailed information concerning their qualifications
as those seeking approval for the first time. Organizations seeking approval for the first time should detail their
experience in the protection, conservation, or management of wild fauna and/or flora, as well as their purposes for
wishing to participate in the COP as an observer. Such requests should be sent to the Office of Management Authority
(OMA; see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

1. Background and Description of the Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91&hyph;190, the
National Park Service (NPS) is preparing an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to determine the final alignment
and the impacts of constructing this final portion of the Natchez Trace Parkway in Adams County, Mississippi. This
portion will include the southern terminus of the parkway and extend from U.S. 84/98 through the city of Natchez to
the vicinity of the Mississippi River, a distance of approximately 7 miles. The EIS will evaluate potential impacts
from a range of alternatives which address cultural and natural resources protection, transportation and socioeconomic
concerns, visitor use, visual characteristics, and interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Natchez Trace Parkway, established in 1938, is a 445-mile long scenic road that follows the historic route of the
Natchez Trace. The parkway links the cities of Natchez, Mississippi and Nashville, Tennessee. About 400 miles of
the parkway have been completed. The purpose of the parkway is to provide and maintain a scenic and recreational roadway
commemorating the historic Old Natchez Trace and to provide access to significant natural and cultural resources
along the route.

Academy of Justice San Diego; Denial of Application
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 5, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then-Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Academy of Justice [San Diego] (Applicant), of San Diego, California
proposing to deny its applications, executed on February 19, 1991, for registration as a teaching institution and
as a researcher. The statutory basis for the Order to Show Cause was that the Applicant did not have authorization to
conduct research with, or otherwise handle, controlled substances under the laws of the State in which it intended
to operate, and that its registration would be inconsistent with the public interest under 21 U.S.C. 823(f).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order to Show Cause was served on the Applicant on October 14, 1993. More than thirty days have passed since the Order
to Show Cause was received by the Applicant and the Drug Enforcement Administration has received no response from
the Applicant or anyone purporting to represent it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Acting Administrator finds that the Applicant has waived its opportunity for a
hearing. The Acting Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter, and enters his
final order under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57, based on findings of fact and conclusions of law
as hereinafter set forth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator finds that the Applicant applied for registration as a researcher and as a teaching institution
to handle controlled substances in Schedules I through V apparently to engage in providing training to law enforcement
personnel in several areas, including those the Applicant identified as drug identification, drug abuse, and psychopharmacology.
Neither the Applicant nor its principal holds any California State controlled substance registration as a practitioner,
or in any other capacity. The Applicant has not offered any evidence contrary to that stated in the Order To Show Cause,
nor has it provided any information that it is otherwise qualified as a teaching institution or researcher under 21
U.S.C. 802(21).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator also finds that although the Applicant proposes to handle such highly abusable controlled
substances such as heroin, marijuana, LSD, methamphetamine and methaqualone, it did not outline their proposed
use in its instructional activities, nor did it indicate that appropriate security safeguards are in place to ensure
against diversion. The Applicant also proposed to have an instructor staff of approximately fifty people who would
transport the controlled substances, on their person, to various training sites throughout the state. Furthermore,
the Applicant's proposed ``teaching institution'' has had no permanent site from which DEA can judge the adequacy
of its security provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator may deny an application for registration if he determines that such registration would be inconsistent
with the public interest. Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest, the following factors
will be considered:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or disciplinary authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Administrator may properly
rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate. Henry J. Schwarz,
Jr., M.D., Docket No. 88&hyph;42, 54 FR 16422 (1989).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator finds that the Applicant has failed to provide any information to indicate that the institution
would be engaged in bona fide research; any recommendations from its State licensing boards; any supporting evidence
that it has had experience in dispensing controlled substances or conducting research; any evidence that it or its
facility is able to comply with all laws relating to controlled substances; and any research protocol or statement
describing its proposed research activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the Acting Administrator has no statutory authority to register practitioners if they are not licensed
in the State in which they practice. 21 U.S.C. 823(f); George P. Gotsis, M.D., 49 FR 33750 (1984); James W. Mitchell,
M.D., 44 FR 71466 (1979). Thus, the Administrator must deny an application for a DEA Certificate of Registration if
he determines that the applicant is not authorized to dispense, or conduct research with respect to, controlled substances
under the laws of the State in which he operates. Based on all of the foregoing, the Acting Administrator concludes
that the applications of Academy of Justice San Diego are inconsistent with the public interest and must be denied.

Accordingly, the Acing Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that the applications for registration, executed
on February 19, 1991, by Cindy Rawlins, Director, on behalf of Academy of Justice San Diego, be, and they hereby are,
denied. This order is effective January 28, 1994.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 5, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then-Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), issued an Ordered to Show Cause to Miquel A. Santos, M.D. (Respondent), HC&hyph;01 Box 6507,
Bo. Magas Abajo, Guayamillas, Puerto Rico 00656&hyph;9715. The Order to Show Cause sought to deny Respondent's application
for a DEA Certificate of Registration, dated May 29, 1990, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f). The Order to Show Cause alleged
that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent with the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated May 19, 1993, Respondent waived his right to a hearing and presented a written statement regarding
his position on the matters of fact and law set forth in the Order to Show Cause. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.57, the Administrator
hereby issues his final order based on the investigative file and Respondent's written statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator finds that in February 1984 in Rabun County, Georgia, Respondent was indicted on twenty-one
felony counts of violating the Georgia Controlled Substances Act. The indictment was based on Respondent's issuing
prescriptions for various Schedule III controlled substances for other than legitimate medical purposes. By Order
dated February 16, 1984, the Composite State Board of Medical Examiners of the State of Georgia (Georgia Board) concluded
that Respondent's ability to practice medicine posed a threat to the public health, safety and welfare, and determined
that emergency action was required. The Georgia Board therefore ordered Respondent to surrender his DEA Certificate
of Registration, and any triplicate prescription forms and order forms. In addition, the Georgia Board suspended
Respondent's license to practice medicine in the State of Georgia. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 17, 1984, Respondent surrendered his DEA Certificate of Registration, AS1270660. Respondent pled guilty
to all twenty-one felony counts and, on March 7, 1984, was sentenced to ten years probation, ordered to pay $12,000.00
and prohibited from returning to the Mountain Judicial Circuit for the period of probation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The investigative file reveals that on October 11, 1990, Respondent appeared before the Georgia Board to request
reinstatement of his medical license. On December 26, 1990, the Georgia Board notified Respondent of its decision
to deny his request. The investigative file also indicates that Respondent is authorized by the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico to handle controlled substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In his letter of May 19, 1993, Respondent explained that he was currently practicing medicine in Ponce, Puerto Rico.
Respondent also alleged that in 1984, he issued numerous prescriptions for controlled substances at the bequest
of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI). Respondent claimed that he was working in cooperation with the GBI in
the GBI's effort to ``break a ring of drug and arms'' trafficking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator finds, however, that the investigative file, which contains voluminous reports from the
GBI, does not support Respondent's assertion that he wrote the prescriptions at issue at the direction of the GBI.
On the contrary, the investigative file indicates that the GBI had received information that Respondent was issuing
prescriptions without valid medical reason and commenced an investigation. Special Agents from the GBI conducted
several undercover operations and were able to obtain prescriptions from Respondent in the absence of a legitimate
medical purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 823(f) of the Controlled Substances Act lists five factors which are to be considered when making a determination
as to whether a registration would be in the public interest. These factors include: (1) The recommendation of the
appropriate State licensing board or professional disciplinary authority; (2) the applicant's experience in dispensing,
or conducting research with respect to controlled substances; (3) the applicant's conviction record under Federal
or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances; (4) compliance
with applicable State, Federal or local laws relating to controlled substances; and, (5) such other conduct which
may threaten the public health and safety. The Administrator may rely on any one or any combination of these factors
when determining whether an application should be denied or a registration revoked. See Neveille H. Williams, D.D.S.,
51 FR 17556 (1986); Anne L. Hendricks, M.D., 51 FR 41030 (1986). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), the Acting Administrator concludes that Respondent's registration would be inconsistent
with the public interest. The Acting Administrator bases this conclusion on the actions of the Georgia Board, which
has chosen not to reinstate Respondent's medical license, Respondent's past history of prescribing controlled
substances in the absence of a legitimate medical reason, and Respondent's felony conviction relating to controlled
substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested
in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that Respondent's application for a DEA Certificate
of Registration be, and it hereby is, denied. This order is effective January 28, 1994.

<DOCTITLE>Jayen C. Shah, M.D.; Revocation of Registration</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 23, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator (then-Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Jayen C. Shah, M.D. of 624 Benner Road, Allentown, Pennsylvania,
proposing to revoke his DEA Certificates of Registration, AS2199328 (Missouri), AS2094756 (Illinois), BS3036185
(Iowa), and BS3067142 (New Jersey); and deny his pending application for registration as a practitioner in Pennsylvania,
for reason that his continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order to Show Cause was sent by registered mail to Dr. Shah at his registered locations in St. Louis, Missouri; East
St. Louis, Illinois; Waterloo, Iowa; Woodbury, New Jersey; and his most recent address in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
The copy sent to the East St. Louis address was returned to the DEA by St. Mary Hospital with the notation that Dr. Shah
was not at that address. Also, the hospital apparently forwarded a copy to Dr. Shah at a Fairview Heights, Illinois
address, which copy was also returned to the DEA, with a notation that Dr. Shah was not there. The Waterloo, Iowa copy
of the Order to Show Cause was returned to the DEA by Emergency Practice Associates with a notation that Dr. Shah is not
an employee there. The Allentown, Pennsylvania copy was returned with the notation that delivery was refused and
it indicated a forwarding postal box address in Ahmedabad, India for Dr. Shah. Delivery of the Order to Show Cause was
accepted at the Woodbury, New Jersey and St. Louis, Missouri addresses on September 27, and 29, 1993, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Shah is no longer in practice or present at two of his registered locations. More than thirty days have passed since
receipt of the Order to Show Cause and no response has been received from Dr. Shah or from any person purporting to represent
him.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 21 CFR 1301.54(d), the Acting Administrator finds that Dr. Shah has waived his opportunity for a hearing.
The Acting Administrator has carefully considered the investigative file in this matter, and enters his final order
under the provisions of 21 CFR 1301.54(e) and 1301.57.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator finds that in January 1989, the Illinois Department of Professional Regulation initiated
an investigation of Dr. Shah based on a complaint that he was over-prescribing the controlled substances Didrex and
Dilaudid. At the same time, Missouri Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs provided Illinois information that
Dr. Shah had been regularly prescribing controlled substances such as Didrex, Dilaudid, Percodan, Halcion, Tylox,
and Xanax to persons identified as ``professional patients''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator finds that during the period October 1988 through August 1989, Dr. Shah prescribed controlled
substances to eight patients not for a legitimate medical purpose and not in the usual course of professional practice.
Also, on three occasions during the period October 20, 1989 through November 10, 1989, Dr. Shah prescribed the controlled
substances Tylox and Percodan for use by a person other than the name indicated on the prescription.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator finds that in October 1989, and at other times during 1988 and 1989, Dr. Shah sold a fraudulent
prescription for the controlled substance Dilaudid in exchange for $400.00 cash, and on November 29, 1989, he sold
a prescription for the controlled substance Percodan in exchange for $40.00 cash. Also, on November 14, 1989, Dr.
Shah proposed to a patient and her relatives that he would provide them two controlled substance prescriptions per
month in exchange for signed Medicare forms and secretarial services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator further finds that the United States Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois, suspended
Dr. Shah's clinical privileges based upon an allegation that he filed a false report in May 1990. Based on the above
Air Force action, on March 17, 1993, the State of Illinois Department of Professional Regulation suspended Dr. Shah's
license to practice medicine indefinitely. On March 26, 1993, Dr. Shah voluntarily surrendered his medical license
to the Missouri Board of Registration for the Healing Arts and is foreclosed from reinstatement for a period of seven
years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Acting Administrator concludes that Dr. Shah is not authorized to administer, dispense, prescribe,
or otherwise handle controlled substances under the laws of Illinois and Missouri, both States in which he is registered
to practice with DEA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrator may revoke or suspend a DEA Certificate of Registration under 21 U.S.C. 824(a), upon a finding that
the registrant:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Has materially falsified any application filed pursuant to or required by this subchapter or subchapter II of
this chapter;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Has been convicted of a felony under this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter or any other law of the United
States, or of any State relating to any substance defined in this subchapter as a controlled substance;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Has had his State license or registration suspended, revoked, or denied by competent State authority and is no
longer authorized by State law to engage in the manufacturing, distribution, or dispensing of controlled substances
or has had the suspension, revocation, or denial of registration recommended by competent State authority;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Has committed such acts as would render his registration under section 823 of this title inconsistent with the
public interest as determined under such section;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Has been excluded (or directed to be excluded) from participation in a program pursuant to Section 1320A&hyph;7(a)
of Title 42.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 823(f), ``[i]n determining the public interest, the following factors will be considered:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The recommendation of the appropriate State licensing board or disciplinary authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicant's experience in dispensing, or conducting research with respect to controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The applicant's conviction record under Federal or State laws relating to the manufacture, distribution, or
dispensing of controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Compliance with applicable State, Federal, or local laws relating to controlled substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Such other conduct which may threaten the public health and safety.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is well established that these factors are to be considered in the disjunctive, i.e., the Administrator may properly
rely on any one or a combination of factors, and give each factor the weight he deems appropriate.

 Docket No. 88&hyph;42, 54 FR 16422 (1989).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Acting Administrator finds that the first, second, fourth, and fifth factors are relevant in this case. Here,
the State licensing bodies of Illinois and Missouri have taken adverse action against Dr. Shah; Dr. Shah has improperly
dispensed controlled substances without a legitimate medical purpose and outside the scope of usual professional
practice; Dr. Shah has violated the Federal Controlled Substances Act and regulations pertaining to controlled
substances; and Dr. Shah's propensity to sell controlled substances for cash or favors, and his improper conduct
with the U.S. Air Force threaten the public health and safety. Furthermore, the Acting Administrator has no statutory
authority to register practitioners if they are not licensed in the State in which they practice. DEA has consistently
held that termination of a registrant's State authority to handle controlled substances requires that DEA revoke
the registrant's DEA Certificate of Registration.

of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b),

Job Corps: Finding of No Significant Impact for the Relocation of the Detroit Job Corps Center in Detroit, MI
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR part 1500 to 1508) implementing procedural
provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration,
Office of Job Corps, in accordance with 29 CFR 11.11(d), gives notice that an Environmental Assessment (EA) has been
prepared and the proposed plans for the relocation of the Detroit Job Corps Center in Detroit, Michigan, will have
no significant environmental impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed site, located in the area of 1800 Tuxedo Street, Detroit, Michigan, is comprised of 13.9 acres, and is
made up of three parcels, which are designated A, B, and C for reference purposes. Parcel A is comprised of 6 vacant lots
(totaling 0.87 acre), located on Webb Street between 12th Street and Woodrow Wilson Boulevard; Parcel B is a 3.2 acre
vacant lot located between the John C. Lodge Freeway and Woodrow Wilson Boulevard, just south of Elmhurst. Parcel
C, comprised of 9.83 acres (currently utilized as a community-oriented outpatient health-care facility) has several
structures: a main building constructed in 1935; three additions built between 1960 and 1972, and two auxiliary buildings
built in 1966. The campus includes paved asphalt parking lots, concrete sidewalks, and a well maintained lawn with
trees and vegetation. A 6-foot chain link fence, topped with barbed wire, surrounds the perimeter of Parcel C. Within
the buildings there are operating and treatment rooms, a dining hall served by vending machines, a library, conference
rooms, an optical laboratory, an emergency room suite, a gift shop, a pharmacy, auxiliary spaces, and administrative
space converted from patient rooms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the proposed action is to convert the Metropolitan Hospital into the Detroit Job Corps Center for 320
resident and 50 non-resident students. The original patient hospital is adaptable to dormitory accommodations
and offers the necessary facilities for the Job Corps program to provide basic education, vocational skills training,
work experience, counseling, health care, and related support services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This new center will provide dormitories, recreational, medical/dental, administrative services, educational
and vocational training, and storage space that is consistent with Job Corps guidelines and center needs. Establishing
a Job Corps Center at this location will require some constructive change to existing buildings. To meet recreational
needs, based on the Job Corps prototype for recreational activities, some construction is needed; e.g., a recreational
building, a new ball field to be constructed on Parcel B, outdoor basketball courts on existing parking areas, and
modification of the existing fencing to extend completely around all three parcels. The proposed project will be
constructed in accordance with local fire, building, and zoning code requirements and will not adversely impact
the City of Detroit police, fire or emergency services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The site is located in an urban setting and is currently zoned R6 (high-density multiple-family residential); however,
over the years residential occupancy has declined substantially. Prior to proceeding with the acquisition of the
Metropolitan Hospital, the Department of Labor secured a letter from the City Planning Office and Community &amp;
Economic Development Department that states that the proposed Job Corps Center is an allowable use under the existing
zoning, thus, no zoning conflict will result from the proposed change in occupancy and rehabilitation of the former
Metropolitan Hospital. The site is bordered on the east by an expressway. The northern boundary is occupied by some
multi-dwelling structures, commercial business, and a store-front type church facility. The western boundary
is comprised of a soup kitchen, a bible missionary center, vacant lots, vacant store fronts, and a large medical supply
company. The southern border includes minimal residential dwellings, a nursing home, a foster-care center for children,
and an apartment building for teenage mothers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The portion of the site identified as Parcel B (which is presently owned by the State of Michigan but will be transferred
to the City of Detroit in the first quarter of 1994) is vacant land and is presently used for illegal dumping of waste,
vehicle tires, roofing and building materials, concrete, and miscellaneous rubbish. It is unknown whether an abandoned
underground storage tank, identified as present on this parcel, has been properly closed. In addition, an underground
tunnel is known to exist at the site but its closure status is not known. Based on the Environmental Assessment, it has
been determined that neither of these site conditions will adversely impact the proposed activities. Conversion
of this part of the site to the Detroit Job Corps Center through environmental restoration would be a positive asset
to the area and would alleviate the State or City of Detroit of a substantial burden and liability.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The alternatives considered in the preparation of the EA were (1) the ``No Purchase'' alternative and (2) to continue
as proposed. Choosing the ``No Purchase'' alternative would require the continued operation of the Detroit Job Corps
Center under the present inadequate poor conditions. The potential for an enhanced facility and improved operational
efficiency afforded by the proposed action indicates that the proposed purchase and improvement of the center is
the preferred alternative.

The proposed use has no significant impact on any natural systems or resources. The existing site and buildings at
the proposed Job Corps Center location are not designated as ``historically significant'' and no areas of archaeological
significance are present. The activities of the proposed Job Corps Center are not of a contaminant generating nature.
The geologic, water, and climatic characteristics of the general vicinity of the site, coupled with the historically
known land use, minimizes the site's potential to be contaminated from possible off-site sources and further minimizes
the impact of contamination. The migration of any contamination that may have occurred through past activities at
the site is likewise minimized, due to impervious soils and deeply located ground water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No significant levels of radon exist on the site. Water samples, taken from drinking fountains within the buildings
on the site have been analyzed for lead content and were found to be well below EPA recommended limits. An asbestos assessment
was performed on the existing facility with subsequent containment and removal of asbestos-containing materials.
Some on-going repairs of past containment efforts are required. Analysis of composite paint chip samples made during
the investigation for the EA indicated the presence of lead at levels that would require removal of the lead-based
paint, if construction activities would disturb this material. This is common for structures constructed prior
to 1980. Procedures for the containment and removal of lead, if deemed necessary, will be prepared by a qualified lead-abatement
contractor and will be properly managed during any future construction activities. The abandoned on-site underground
storage tank and underground tunnel on Parcel B may require additional investigation. These items are addressed
in the EA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing environmental concerns (e.g., air quality issues resulting from the improperly controlled and monitored
medical waste incinerator, lens-process waste effluent discharge into sanitary sewer by the optical laboratory,
management of hazardous materials, etc.) created by the operations of the current facilities on parcel C, although
not a significant impact on the proposed activities, would become moot through a change of operations and activities
at the proposed Job Corps Center.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noise levels generated from air conditioning and other equipment at the existing facilities are consistent with
City of Detroit regulations. Short-term impact from additional noise will occur during the construction activities;
however, construction activities will be limited to the hours of 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The use of sound control devices
and muffled exhausts on all noise-generating construction equipment will be required. The use of appropriate techniques
to minimize construction dust emissions will mitigate construction-related air pollution concerns. Any noise
generated by the completed facility is expected to remain within allowable noise limits and will not adversely impact
neighboring properties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing site and security lighting consists of facility-owned and maintained building-mounted, photocell-controlled,
high-intensity discharge (HID) luminaries and utility company-owned and maintained pole-mounted, photocell-controlled
HID luminaries located along the streets and in the parking areas. This proposed project will bring the exterior lighting
conditions into compliance with City lighting ordinances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water is available to the site through municipal lines. Storm water run-off and sanitary wastes are accommodated
by discharge to municipal sewers. Based on the nature of the proposed construction activities at the site, storm water
quality will not be degraded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Detroit has an abundance of water, electrical power, and natural gas to easily serve facilities of this size and substantially
larger. Although the proposed project will cause an increase in traffic in the community, the increase in traffic
value is not expected to adversely affect traffic flow on neighborhood streets. A neighborhood city hall and post
office are located in close proximity to the site. Several emergency response companies service the area. Police
and fire stations are closely located near the subject property. Several major and world known hospitals are within
a five-mile radius of the subject site. Several bus routes offer readily available transportation to and through
the subject area at a reasonable cost. Four of Detroit's six Interstate Highways are within a five-mile radius of the
subject site and allow fast and easy access throughout the Detroit area. The surrounding community, with its markedly
diverse ethnicity, offers adequate recreational, educational and cultural opportunities for the students. The
implementation of the Job Corps on the proposed site will provide jobs for vicinity residents and could add stability
to the area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the information gathered during the preparation of the EA for the Department of Labor, Employment and Training
Administration, the Office of Job Corps finds that the relocation of the Detroit Job Corps Center to the 1800 Tuxedo
area location in Detroit, will not cause any significant impact on the environment and, therefore, recommends that
the project continue as proposed. This proposed action is not considered to be highly controversial. Copies of the
EA and additional information are available to interested parties by contacting Mr. Gordon Carlson, Director, Region
V, Office of Job Corps, at (312) 353&hyph;1311 (this is not a toll free number).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This solicitation consists of four parts. Part I provides the background and purpose of the demonstration project(s).
Part II identifies possible demonstration models. Part III describes the application process and provides detailed
guidelines for use in applying for the demonstration grant and the selection criteria used in reviewing the applications.
Part IV describes the reporting requirements.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Studies have indicated that although large numbers of farmworkers actively leave agricultural employment annually,
equally large numbers depend on continued long-term employment in agriculture for their livelihood. For those seeking
to leave agriculture, programs annually funded under section 402 of the JTPA offer classroom and skill training leading
to employment opportunities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Farmworkers opting to remain in agriculture are dependent on an agricultural employment system that is at times affected
by weather conditions and changing local labor market needs and economic factors, but is always constant in its unforgiving
working conditions and long term negative effect on the farmworker's health and economic well being.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is interested in aiding farmworkers seeking employment opportunities and a future outside of agriculture,
while at the same time stabilizing the farm labor force by providing labor market information and enhancing the skills
and well being of farmworkers (and their dependents) wishing to remain in agriculture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Labor is focusing this solicitation on demonstration efforts that will address issues that directly
impact the daily lives of farmworkers_both seasonal and migrant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department will consider and fund one or more demonstration project(s) that encompass (one or more) aspects of
the following topic areas: (a) A labor market information system that would provide farmworkers with accurate and
timely data concerning crop planting and harvest conditions, employment opportunities, housing conditions and
the availability of supportive services, etc.; (b) a program model that employs work-based learning concepts to
demonstrate a new approach in retraining farmworkers (either in upgraded farmwork employment or in employment opportunities
outside of agriculture); (c) a program model that serves to transition farmworkers into newly emerging fields of
technology_taking into account the barriers faced by farmworkers, while at the same time satisfying the skill and
cognitive needs of the targeted industry; (d) a program model that serves to reinvent the manner in which the hardest
of farmworkers to serve are provided retraining and/or training in areas that will directly impact and enhance their
lives and the lives of their families; (e) a program model that creates an information network linking farmworker
service delivery agents for the purpose of creating a data base that could be used for sharing client information.
This in turn could have the effect of more efficiently and effectively rendering services to the farmworker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In calling for grant applications, the Department is not limiting or suggesting geographic areas or regions, nor
is the Department limiting the design of projects to those suggested above. Applicants are free to identify the geographic
area in which their proposed demonstration project will be tested. Applicants should also understand that the Department
will exercise its option of funding one or more demonstration projects based on a review and appraisal of those received
under this SGA notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Demonstration projects under this initiative may try out new approaches to serving farmworkers and in the process
assess and test new ideas that may integrate the provision of services, classroom training and structured worksite
learning. The demonstration project(s) may establish a fundamental change in the way farmworker organizations
and agents of technical and skill training provide assistance to migrant and seasonal farmworkers.

2. The development of a training model that would establish a new approach to retraining farmworkers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposal submitted under this model, should involve the structuring of worksite learning (that would include innovative
approaches in combining classroom and skill training) which would be effectuated to meet the specific learning needs
of farmworkers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This would include the geographic location in which the model would be conducted and the rationale for its selection;
the technology and methodology to be employed; a listing of participating employers where worksite learning would
occur; an identification of the specific learning needs to be focused upon which may be unique to farmworkers; and
a description of how coordination will take place with farmworker organizations within the proposed service area
and a listing of those organizations. The grantee shall, after establishing a timeframe for initiating the proposed
project, commence operations within the first four months; shall select or develop alternative and innovative approaches
to instruction and the uses of teaching techniques and instructional materials, work relevant curricula and motivational
resources designed for participants who read at the eighth grade level; shall conduct and provide the Department
with an assessment of both current and future local service area labor market needs with concomitant entry-level
requirements; shall structure worksite learning (in concert with the participating employers) for participating
section 402 eligible farmworkers; shall establish cooperative agreements between selected employers (for worksite
learning activities) and service area farmworker program operators and the grantee; shall evaluate, assess and
provide the Department with a report concerning the outcomes of the methodology employed through this effort and

3. The development of a training model that would incorporate new methodologies in transitioning farmworkers with
limited English-speaking ability and skills into the newly emerging and technically demanding workplace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant should include the geographic area in which this demonstration project will be tested along with the
rationale for its selection; the methodology to be employed; a description of the industry(ies) selected with a focus
on those aspects which now require higher skilled entry-level workers and the manner in which farmworkers from rural
areas with limited English will be trained for these new jobs; a description regarding how the project will coordinate
with local organizations serving farmworkers_and how this would benefit the participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grantee shall develop a methodology for transitioning participating farmworkers from agricultural employment
in rural areas into employment training opportunities where new technology has produced more demanding entry-level
jobs and where long-term job opportunities now exist; shall develop linkages with farmworker organizations within
and serving the designated project area for the purpose of recruitment, selection and the provision of supportive
services to the participants; shall provide rationale for selection of participating industries; shall provide
analysis and rationale for selection of training methods to be used and a timeframe projection for success of project;
shall provide an approach to easing the transition process for the farmworker participants whose native language
is not English.

4. The development of a training model that would include a methodology which may innovatively address the needs of
the hardest to serve farmworkers while at the same time imparting employability skills.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant should include an identification of the geographic area selected and the rationale for the site selection.
It should also include a description of the following: How participants would be identified and recruited, the instructional
methodology to be employed and how this would be tied into skill instruction (either in skill areas outside of agricultural
employment or leading to upgraded positions within agriculture). Included would be a description of the manner in
which farmworker organizations within the designated demonstration service area would be utilized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grantee shall select or develop a methodology or technique that is reflective of addressing the unique needs of
the farmworker clientele of the section 402 programs who have been identified as the hardest to serve_those being
individuals with the disadvantage of having limited skills, limited English and limited reading and cognitive abilities;
shall demonstrate how this methodology may prove to be more effective_in terms of outcomes_than previously used
practices; shall identify, recruit and enroll farmworkers who satisfy the afore-stated barriers for participation
in the demonstration model; shall provide the Department with progress assessments of the participants at agreed
upon periods during the grant; and shall establish measurable benchmarks to determine the success and effectiveness
of the model.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. The development of a training model that sets out a technical approach to link farmworker service delivery agents
in order to share clientele information, and the establishment of a related data base.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal should identify the geographic region selected and the rationale for it. It should include a description
of the methodology to be used and those organizations selected to participate. It should describe the data to be collected,
how it will be used and how it will benefit the farmworkers_either directly or indirectly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the development and submission of a grant application to this SGA, applicants must demonstrate an understanding
of the farmworker population_including socio-economic conditions and prevailing regional and ethnic cultures
of the people whom the Department is mandated to serve; a knowledge and understanding of the migratory streams which
farmworkers travel in search of employment in agriculture and the living and working conditions which prevail in
migrant farmworker streams; a knowledge and understanding of the methods of providing employment and training activities
and services in behalf of migrant and seasonal farmworkers; a knowledge and understanding of the current agricultural
recruitment and employment system; a knowledge and understanding of demonstrated expertise in the proffered activities
under the proposed effort; and finally, demonstrated support of the community and knowledge of the labor market for
which the project is proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Perhaps one of the more important goals of this initiative is focusing attention on the unique employment and training
needs of migrant and seasonal farmworkers and bringing to bear upon this challenge a creative and innovative approach.
With this in mind, these demonstration grants are intended to lay the foundation for a new approach in serving farmworkers
and/or providing an augmentation to existing employment and training efforts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The grantee shall establish cooperative arrangements with all organizations serving farmworkers within the designated
geographic region of this demonstration model; shall develop a data base for the collection of relevant information;
shall demonstrate how this data will be beneficial to the participating farmworker organizations, the U.S. Department
of Labor, and to the farmworkers; shall provide the Department with periodic status reports on the progress toward
the goals of this model demonstration; shall establish a methodology for linking all farmworker programs in the designated
area so that they may access, contribute to, and benefit from the data base.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General wage determination decisions of the Secretary of Labor are issued in accordance with applicable law and are
based on the information obtained by the Department of Labor from its study of local wage conditions and data made available
from other sources. They specify the basic hourly wage rates and fringe benefits which are determined to be prevailing
for the described classes of laborers and mechanics employed on construction projects of a similar character and
in the localities specified therein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determinations in these decisions of prevailing rates and fringe benefits have been made in accordance with 29
CFR part 1, by authority of the Secretary of Labor pursuant to the provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act of March 3, 1931,
as amended (46 Stat. 1494, as amended, 40 U.S.C. 276a) and of other Federal statutes referred to in 29 CFR part 1, appendix,
as well as such additional statutes as may from time to time be enacted containing provisions for the payment of wages
determined to be prevailing by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act. The prevailing rates
and fringe benefits determined in these decisions shall, in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing statutes,
constitute the minimum wages payable on Federal and federally assisted construction projects to laborers and mechanics
of the specified classes engaged on contract work of the character and in the localities described therein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good cause is hereby found for not utilizing notice and public comment procedure thereon prior to the issuance of these
determinations as prescribed in 5 U.S.C. 553 and not providing for delay in the effective date as prescribed in that
section, because the necessity to issue current construction industry wage determinations frequently and in large
volume causes procedures to be impractical and contrary to the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General wage determination decisions, and modifications and supersedes decisions thereto, contain no expiration
dates and are effective from their date of notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, or on the date written notice is received by the agency, whichever is earlier. These decisions are to be used in accordance
with the provisions of 29 CFR parts 1 and 5. Accordingly, the applicable decision, together with any modifications
issued, must be made a part of every contract for performance of the described work within the geographic area indicated
as required by an applicable Federal prevailing wage law and 29 CFR part 5. The wage rates and fringe benefits, notice
of which is published herein, and which are contained in the Government Printing Office (GPO) document entitled ``General
Wage Determinations Issued Under The Davis-Bacon And Related Acts,'' shall be the minimum paid by contractors and
subcontractors to laborers and mechanics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person, organization, or governmental agency having an interest in the rates determined as prevailing is encouraged
to submit wage rate and fringe benefit information for consideration by the Department. Further information and
self-explanatory forms for the purpose of submitting this data may be obtained by writing to the U.S. Department of
Labor, Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hours Division, Division of Wage Determinations, 200 Constitution

Trent Coal, Inc., 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, has filed a petition to modify the application
of 30 CFR 75.380(f) (escapeways; bituminous and lignite mines) to its Rice No. 2 Mine (I.D. No. 36&hyph;03636) located
in Cambria County, Pennsylvania. Due to the size of the electric golf carts used in the primary escapeway and the relative
size of fire suppression systems, these golf carts would not be able to operate satisfactorily with such a system.
The petitioner proposes to construct the golf carts of fire-resistant material, protect the battery/motor circuit
by a fuse, perform all battery charging on the surface, and provide all golf carts with a multipurpose dry chemical
fire extinguisher. Petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure
of protection as would the mandatory standard.

at the mine site and states that the product would parallel that of a conventional Ammonium Nitrate/No. 2 diesel fuel
conventional ANFO blasting agent product.

(moving machine parts) to its Asphalt Mine (I.D. No. 04&hyph;04896) located in San Benito County, California. The
petitioner states that it is impossible to provide the guard required by the standard due to pinch points and a heavily
congested area in a confined space. Petitioner proposes to prohibit entry of miners while plant is energized by installing

of 30 CFR 56.14107 (moving machine parts) to its Midway Stone No. 45 mine (I.D. No. 11&hyph;00134) located in Rock Island

equipment within a 6-foot fence with a padlocked gate, the gate to be equipped with an electrical interlock wired directly
to the motor control circuit which de-energizes the motor if the gate is opened. Petitioner states that this method
of guarding will afford the miners at least the same level of safety as would the guarding required by the standard.

Magma Copper Company, 7400 North Oracle Road, Suite 200, Tucson, Arizona 85704, has filed a petition to modify the
application of 30 CFR 57.9360(a) (shelter holes) to its San Manuel Mine (I.D. No. 02&hyph;00151) located in Pinal
County, Arizona. The petitioner proposes two alternative sets of stipulations. The first set of stipulations would
use pony set shelter holes located 10 feet above the panel floor as designated ``shelter holes'' in all haulage panels
at intervals of approximately 35 feet regardless of clearance; to provide training to all crews working on haulage
on the use of the pony sets when trains are in the panel; to include new procedures and policies for haulage levels in
its new policy manual; to post signs throughout the haulage panels directing crews to use the pony sets as shelter holes
when trains are moving in the panel; and to keep train speeds in the haulageways at less than 5 mph to allow ample time
to access the pony set shelter holes. Also, petitioner proposes a second alternative set of stipulations to use certain
existing manway shelter holes as designated shelter holes in all haulage panels; to train all crews working on haulage;
and to include new procedures and policies in its policy manual. The petitioner states that application of the mandatory
standard would result in a diminution of safety to the miners. In addition, the petitioner asserts that either of the
proposed alternative methods would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notices were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.

General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is closing the local public document room (LPDR)
for records pertaining to the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Research Reactor located at the West
Los Angeles Regional Library, Los Angeles, California. The LPDR is no longer needed and will close effective February
11, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The West Los Angeles Regional Library has been the LPDR for the UCLA Research Reactor since December 1980 when it was
established for the proposed license renewal. Since that time the LPDR has remained operational maintaining documents
on the termination of the UCLA License No. R&hyph;71 through the decommissioning of the facility. On December 28,
1993, the NRC issued an Order releasing the UCLA Research Reactor Facility for unrestricted use. Therefore, effective
February 11, 1994, the LPDR will be closed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->
</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
License Nos. DPR&hyph;80 and DPR&hyph;82 issued to Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the licensee) for operation
of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant located in San Luis Obispo County, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments would revise the combined Technical Specifications (TS) 3/4.32, ``Engineered Safety Features
Actuation System Instrumentation,'' and TS 3/4.6.2.3. ``Containment Cooling System.'' TS 3/4.3.2, Table 3.3&hyph;3,
``Engineered Safety Features Actuation System Instrumentation Surveillance Requirements,'' would be revised
to clarify acceptable containment fan cooling unit (CFCU) configurations that satisfy the safety analysis requirements
and to clarify the minimum required component cooling water flow supplied to the CFCU cooling coils. The specific
TS changes proposed are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) TS 3.3.2, Table 3.3&hyph;3 and Table 4.3&hyph;2, Functional Units 2.c. and 3.b.3), would be revised to expand
the mode applicability to Mode 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) TS 3.6.2.3 would be revised to require that at least four containment fan cooling units (CFCUs), or three CFCUs,
each supplied by a separate vital bus, be operable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) TS 3.6.2.3, action statement a., would be revised to clarify the equipment required to be operable when in the action
statement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) TS 3.6.2.3, action statement b., would be deleted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) TS 3.6.2.3, action statement c., would be renumbered to action statement b. and revised to clarify the equipment
required to be operable when in the action statement.

(6) TS 4.6.2.3.a.2) would be revised to clarify the minimum component cooling water (CCW) flow to the CFCUs as 1650
gpm during normal operation which will assure that the required accident flow is satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) A footnote would be added to the surveillance requirement of TS 4.6.2.3.a.2) allowing all CFCUs to have flow CCW

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the [component cooling water] CCW system nor the containment pressure high-high signal initiate any accident,
and therefore, do not affect the probability of an accident occurring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addition of Mode 4 to the applicability of the containment high-high pressure signal provides assurance that the
containment spray system will automatically actuate and the CCW nonvital header will automatically isolate is response
to the high containment pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deletion of action statement b. of TS 3.6.2.3 is conservative since it assures that adequate containment heat removal
is available and assures that the assumptions of the bounding Mode 1 containment [design basis accident] DBA are satisfied.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the CCW flow rates to the CFCUs clarifies the expected CCW flow rates during normal operation. Operation
within the flow requirements assures that adequate flow will be available to the CFCUs to satisfy the assumptions
in the containment DBA in [final safety analysis report] FSAR Section 6.2B.3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PG&amp;E analysis has determined that with three CFCUs available for containment heat removal , adequate CCW flow
will be available with both [residual heat removal] RHR heat exchangers in service to provide assurance that the maximum
design pressure of containment is not exceeded, assuming a single failure does not occur.

The revisions to clarify CFCU configurations that satisfy the [limiting condition for operation] LCO and action
statements and the removal of cycle specific information from the containment cooling TS are administrative changes
that do not affect the operating methodology of Diablo Canyon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revision to the minimum CCW flow requirement to the CFCU cooling coils updates a requirement currently in the TS.
The new flow requirement assures that the maximum containment design pressure will not be exceeded during a DBA and
assures that the CCW system is not overheated. The changes do not result in any physical modification to any plant system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to clarify CFCU configurations that satisfy the LCO and action statements and the removal of cycle specific
information from the containment cooling TS are administrative changes that do not affect the operating methodology

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revising the CCW flow rates to the CFCUs clarifies the expected CCW flow rates during normal operation that satisfy
the assumptions in the containment design basis accident described in FSAR Update Section 6.2B.3. The revision is
an administrative change that clarifies the intent of the TS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PG&amp;E analysis has determined that with three CFCUs available for containment heat removal, adequate CCW flow
will be available with both RHR heat exchangers in service to provide assurance that the maximum design pressure of
containment is not exceeded, assuming a single failure does not occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The revisions to clarify CFCU configurations that satisfy the LCO and action statements and the removal of cycle specific
information from the containment cooling TS are administrative changes that do not affect the operating methodology

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By February 28, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at California Polytechnic State University, Robert F. Kennedy
Library, Government Documents and Maps Department, San Luis Obispo, California 93407. If a request for a hearing
or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,
designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request
and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing
or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 7, 1993, a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was issued for a violation
identified during an NRC inspection on December 14, 1992, through January 13, 1993. Indiana University School of
Medicine responded to the Notice in a letter dated October 29, 1993. In its response, the licensee disputes the validity
of the cited violation. Further, the licensee takes exception to the NRC Staff's application of identification and
licensee performance civil penalty adjustment factors. The NRC's evaluation and conclusions regarding the licensee's
requests are as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Restatement of Violation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
10 CFR 35.32(a) states, in part, that each licensee shall establish and maintain a written quality management program
to provide high confidence that radiation from byproduct material will be administered as directed by the authorized
user. Pursuant to 10 CFR 35.32(a) (1) and (3), the quality management program must include written policies and procedures
to meet specific objectives that: (1) Prior to administration, a written directive is prepared for any teletherapy
radiation dose; and (2) final plans of treatment and related calculations for teletherapy are in accordance with
the written directive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 35.2 defines a written directive as an order in writing for a specific patient, dated and signed by an authorized
user prior to administration of radiation and containing, for teletherapy, the following information: The total
dose, dose per fraction, treatment site, and overall treatment period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the above, as of January 13, 1993, the licensee's quality management program for teletherapy dated January
16, 1992, did not have a procedure for: (1) Ensuring the written directive contained the total dose, dose per fraction,
treatment site, and overall treatment period and (2) verifying the dose calculations for administrations of three
fractions or less to confirm that the final plans of treatment are in accordance with the written directive. Consequently,
on November 13, 1992, the licensee's authorized user signed and dated a written directive for teletherapy treatment
that failed to include the overall treatment period and the licensee failed to verify the dose calculations, since
the treatment called for less than 3 fractions, to ensure the final plans of treatment were in accordance with the written
directive.

The licensee disputes the validity of the cited violation, the assigned Severity Level, and the NRC root cause analysis,
as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The licensee asserts that the proposed violation did not cause the misadministration even though the written directive
did include the overall treatment period. In the written directive for the patient treated November 13, 1992, the
number of fractions is written as ``2 fx'' which means the treatment period is to include two fractions or treatments.
This is the licensee's interpretation of the overall treatment period. The licensee asserts that the term ``overall
treatment period'' is not defined in the regulations or in Regulatory Guide 8.33. According to the licensee, the presence
or absence of the documentation of the overall treatment period would have no bearing on the initial interpretational
error made by the dosimetrist or the subsequent oversights by individuals who were verifying the correctness of the
treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The licensee notes that the treatment was performed on an emergency basis and that this fact causes the standard
verification procedure to change depending upon the availability of staff. According to the licensee, while neither
the Quality Control/Quality Assurance Program (QA/QCP) nor the Quality Management Program (QMP) include specific
procedures for verification when less than four treatments are prescribed, no change in the subsequent chart checking
procedures would have resulted because the treatment in question as an emergency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee also asserts that it verified the dose calculations in that the prescribing physician/authorized user
and two radiation therapists attempted to verify that the treatment to be delivered was in accordance with the written
directive. According to the licensee, while none of these individuals identified the calculational error made by
the dosimetrist, their failure to identify the error was related to the wording of the written directive rather than
the failure to follow proper procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The licensee challenges the categorization of the proposed violation as a Severity Level III violation. The licensee
asserts that the misadministration occurred due to inconsistencies in the format of the written directive, and that
the QMP was followed and the appropriate checks were made. According to the licensee, the violation would be more appropriately
categorized at Severity Level IV since it does not represent a programmatic weakness in the implementation of the
QMP, the failure was isolated to the single event, and the consequences were limited and did not adversely affect the
patient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The licensee disagrees with the NRC's statement that, ``The violation contributed to the occurrence of a misadministration
on November 13, 1992.''

NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Response to the Violation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This enforcement action focuses on the licensee's failure to develop and implement an adequate QMP. As a result of
the misadministration, the NRC performed a detailed review of the licensee's QMP during the followup inspection
and enforcement deliberations. The result of this detailed review was that the NRC identified substantial deficiencies.
The inspection determined that the licensee's written QMP did not have procedures for: (1) Ensuring that the written
directive contained the total dose, dose per fraction, treatment site, and the overall treatment period; and (2)
verifying the dose calculations for administrations of three fractions or less to confirm that the final plans of
treatment are in accordance with the written directive. The licensee has not provided any information to demonstrate
that its written QMP addressed these procedures. These deficiencies represent a programmatic (as opposed to isolated)
failure in the implementation of the QMP; therefore, the violation was categorized at Severity Level III in accordance
with the NRC Enforcement Policy, Supplement VI.C.6 (57 FR 5792).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
NRC has defined the term ``overall treatment period'' in the Statement of Considerations for the QMP rule (56 FR 34104).
According to the Statement of Considerations, ``the phrase `overall treatment period' was added to emphasize that
the treatments will end after the specified number of weeks, unless the treatment period is revised by the authorized
user prior to continuing.'' Therefore, the treatment period is a unit of time and not the number of fractions as used
in the licensee's definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee argues that three different individuals (the authorized user and two radiation therapists) attempted
to verify that the treatment to be delivered was in accordance with the written directive, and that the failure to identify
the error was related to the working of the written directive rather than a failure to follow proper procedure. However,
the same authorized user had created the written directive that same afternoon. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely
that his failure to identify the error was related to the wording of his own written directive. The licensee's QMP procedure
required that the authorized user review and initial the treatment chart to verify that he had reviewed the written
prescription and the calculated dose per fraction. As noted in the inspection report, the information written on
the patient chart clearly indicated that the dose per fraction was incorrect. It appears that the authorized user
initialed the chart and that his review was cursory or inadequate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the violation focuses on the fact that, while the licensee's QMP requires that a physics staff member review
the accuracy of all dosimetric calculations for treatments that are delivered in four or more fractions, it has no
equivalent provision for treatments that are delivered in less than four fractions. Had such an independent review
been required by the Licensee's QMP and performed in this case, the error could have been avoided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee's QMP waived review of dose calculations by the physics staff member for extenuating circumstances
such as staff shortages and emergency treatments. Neither the QMP regulations nor the accompanying regulatory guide
suggest that this independent review may be waived for staff shortages or emergent treatments, such as those that
must be performed after working hours. A footnote to 10 CFR 35.32(a)(1) states, ``if, because of the emergent nature
of the patient's medical condition, a delay in order to provide a written directive would jeopardize the patient's
health, an oral directive will be acceptable, provided that the information contained in the oral directive is documented
immediately in the patient's record and a written directive is prepared within 24 hours of the oral directive.'' Neither
10 CFR 35.32(a) nor the footnote permit the waiving of the independent review of the dosimetric calculations due to
the emergent nature of a treatment. The independent verification is especially important during times when the licensee
is more subject to error such as with staff shortages and emergent treatments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the NRC concludes that the violation did occur as stated, and that there was not an adequate basis
for a reduction of the severity level.

1. Identification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensee asserts that the NRC improperly takes credit for identifying the proposed violation of the QMP because
the QMP was submitted to the NRC approximately 1.5 years ago in accordance with 10 CFR 35.32(f)(2); and, since that
submission, the licensee has received no indication that the QMP was deficient. According to the licensee, the ``less
than four treatment'' deficiency was detected concurrently by the NRC and the licensee as a result of this misadministration;
and therefore, escalation of enforcement based on the NRC's claim of identifying the deficiency is inappropriate.

2. Licensee Performance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The licensee asserts that the NRC improperly escalated the base civil penalty by 100 percent for ``poor past performance''
and notes that this was apparently due to a misadministration which occurred in May of 1990, some 2.5 years before the
most recent one. According to the licensee, while the NRC claims that these two misadministrations were ``similar'',
the only similarities were that they were both brain treatments and the dose per fraction was doubled. The licensee
notes that the dissimilarities include an emergency treatment versus treatment during normal working hours, a short-term
versus a more conventional long-term treatment, and a single port treatment versus a multiple port treatment. According
to the licensee, there appears to be no relationship between the causes of the two misadministrations. The licensee
indicates that this escalation implies that the NRC's sole evaluation of past performance relates to the number of
misadministrations which have occurred and been reported over an undefined period of time. The licensee points out
that the May 1990 misadministration was discovered through its QA/QCP and, until January of 1992, most licensees
were not required to have any type of QMP; therefore, comparing the licensee's performance to that of other licensees
in not appropriate (i.e., other licensees may have had misadministrations which went undetected due to the fact that
they had no QMP). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee asserts that while a QMP helps reduce the possibility of misadministrations, normal statistical probabilities
would predict that the potential for misadministrations will increase with the number of patient treatments due
to human error. In the licensee's particular instance, its Radiation Oncology Department treated approximately
1418 patients including some 52,000 separate treatments with external beam therapy during the time interval between
the two misadministrations. Five hundred and eighteen (518) of those patients (approximately 15,000 separate treatments)
were specifically treated with cobalt-60 teletherapy. According to the licensee, one patient with two ports in error
is a very small percentage of the overall number of treatments and should not be sufficient to escalate a civil penalty
based upon ``poor past performance.''

1. Identification
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Licensees may not expect, or rely on, NRC to identify safety problems or violations for them. The Enforcement Policy
provides that the purpose of the identification factor is to encourage licensees to monitor, supervise, and audit
activities in order to assure safety and compliance. By the licensee's own admission, it did not detect the problems
noted in the violation during the 1.5 years that its QMP has been in existence, nor is there any evidence that the licensee
identified the specific problems noted in the violation before NRC did. For example, these problems are not noted
in the licensee's December 17, 1992 misadministration report, which includes a section entitled, ``Improvements
and Actions Taken to Prevent Recurrence.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, the NRC concludes that 50 percent escalation of the base civil penalty is warranted for NRC identification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Licensee Performance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC Enforcement Policy states that prior performance refers to the licensee's performance normally (1) within
the last two years of the inspection at issue, or (2) the period within the last two inspections, whichever is longer.
On this case the period covered by the last two inspections is applicable, i.e., two inspections prior to the inspection
at issue. The two previous inspections to be considered are the inspection conducted on September 11, 1991, and the
inspection conducted on May 21&hyph;23, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC did not compare the licensee's performance with other licensees. The Enforcement Policy provides that the
effectiveness of previous corrective action for similar problems is a consideration in assessing the licensee performance
factor. The May 1990 inspection was conducted to review the circumstances surrounding a teletherapy misadministration.
The physicist performing the treatment dose calculation misinterpreted the physician's written prescription.
The error continued undetected despite at least four separate opportunities for the dosimetry and physician staffs
and several opportunities for the technologists to identify the problem. In its misadministration report of May
24, 1990, the licensee noted that loss of objectivity was a causative factor in that the various QA checks had not been
performed as an independent review. The licensee's corrective action was to turn an existing requirement that the
authorized user initial the chart before the treatment begins into a full QA check involving a review by the physician
of, among other things, the calculated dose per fraction. A memorandum entitled ``Chart checking of treatment doses
and calculations'' was circulated to emphasize to physicians and other key personnel the importance of vigilant
and critically minded checking of doses and dose calculations. Thus, the NRC concludes that the root causes of the
misadministrations are sufficiently similar to warrant escalation for past performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee also argues good past performance in that a very small percentage of its treatments were misadministrations.
On the contrary, the NRC is concerned that the licensee was performing a high volume of treatments with a deficient
QMP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, 100 percent escalation of the base civil penalty is warranted for poor licensee performance.

NRC Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on its evaluation of the licensee's response, the NRC staff concludes that the violation did occur as stated,
and that neither an adequate basis for a reduction of the severity level nor for mitigation of the civil penalty has
been provided by the licensee. Accordingly, NRC concludes that a civil monetary penalty of $5,000 should be imposed
by order.

The meetings will start at 10:45 a.m. and will be held in Room 5A06A, Office of Personnel Management Building, 1900
E Street, NW., Washington, DC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee is composed of a Chairman, representatives from five labor unions
holding exclusive bargaining rights for Federal blue-collar employees, and representatives from five Federal
agencies. Entitlement to membership on the Committee is provided for in 5 U.S.C. 5347.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee's primary responsibility is to review the Prevailing Rate System and other matters pertinent to establishing
prevailing rates under subchapter IV, chapter 53, 5 U.S.C., as amended, and from time to time advise the Office of Personnel
Management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These scheduled meetings will start in open session with both labor and management representatives attending. During
the meeting either the labor members or the management members may caucus separately with the Chairman to devise strategy
and formulate positions. Premature disclosure of the matters discussed in these caucuses would unacceptably impair
the ability of the Committee to reach a consensus on the matters being considered and would disrupt substantially
the disposition of its business. Therefore, these caucuses will be closed to the public because of a determination
made by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management under the provisions of section 10(d) of the Federal Advisory
Committee Act (Pub. L. 92&hyph;463) and 5 U.S.C. 552b(c)(9)(B). These caucuses may, depending on the issues involved,
constitute a substantial portion of the meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Annually, the Committee publishes for the Office of Personnel Management, the President, and Congress a comprehensive
report of pay issues discussed, concluded recommendations, and related activities. These reports are available
to the public, upon written request to the Committee's Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public is invited to submit material in writing to the Chairman on Federal Wage System pay matters felt to be deserving
of the Committee's attention. Additional information on these meetings may be obtained by contacting the Committee's
Secretary, Office of Personnel Management, Federal Prevailing Rate Advisory Committee, Room 1340, 1900 E Street,

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 23, 1993, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities

Retention of disciplinary jurisdiction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Act, the Exchange is required to investigate possible wrongdoing by persons and entities subject to its
jurisdiction and, if warranted, initiate appropriate disciplinary action. The Exchange's disciplinary jurisdiction
extends to its members, member organizations, and their registered employees. Article V, Section 6 of the Exchange
Constitution and Rule 341 permit the Exchange to retain disciplinary jurisdiction even after the termination of
a person's or an entity's status as a member, member organization, or registered employee, provided that it gives
them written notice that it is retaining jurisdiction within one year immediately following its receipt of written
notice of their termination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Member firms are required to file a termination notice with the Exchange whenever a registered employee leaves their
employ. In most cases, these reflect voluntary resignations. However, member firms are also required to file amended
termination notices, subsequent to the registered employee's departure, if they become aware of customer complaints
or other possible wrongdoing by the employee. The Exchange has always taken the position that the one year period to
retain jurisdiction under its rules begins to run only after it is notified by the member firm of possible violative
conduct by the registered employee. We believe that this is a logical position since the Exchange would have no reason
to retain jurisdiction and initiate an investigation unless it had reason to believe a violation may have been committed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recently, in an appeal to the SEC, a respondent in an Exchange disciplinary proceeding asserted that the Exchange
lacked jurisdiction over him because it failed to notify him within one year from the time his former firm filed a termination
notice reporting his voluntary resignation.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In that case, the Exchange retained jurisdiction within one year of receiving an amended termination notice reporting
a customer complaint against the registered representative. The SEC agreed with the respondent, adopting the more
narrow, literal reading of our jurisdictional provision, requiring the Exchange to retain jurisdiction within
one year of its receipt of a termination notice, regardless of whether such notice contains any indication of actionable
conduct. However, the Commission in its decision indicated that it was sensitive to the Exchange's position and would
be receptive to the Exchange amending its rules to expressly provide that the one year time period begins upon receipt
of the original termination notice or any subsequent amendment of such notice, whichever is later.

By so amending the applicable Constitutional and rule provisions, the Exchange will close an existing gap in its disciplinary
process which permits possible wrongdoers to escape investigation by the Exchange into potentially serious misconduct.
It should be noted that the CBOE and the NASD have rule provisions relating to retention of discipolinary jurisdiction
comparable to the changes we are proposing.

Settlement of disciplinary actions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Exchange's Enforcement Department is charged with the responsibility of issuing disciplinary charges if, following
an investigation, it is determined that persons or entities within the Exchange's jurisdiction committed serious
infractions of the exchange's rules or the Federal securities laws. The issuance of formal charges begins a rather
lengthy process involving the filing of an answer to the charges, the exchange of documents, and the scheduling of
a disciplinary hearing. Very often, however, persons who are the subject of Exchange investigations wish to settle
the matter before formal charges are issued by stipulating to certain facts and consenting to a penalty. At present,
Article V, section 1(b)(4) of the Constitution and Rule 345(c) require the issuance of formal charges before a disciplinary
matter can be settled. In contrast, the comparable rules at the NYSE, NASD, and CBOE permit potential respondents
to settle disciplinary proceedings without the service of formal charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the Exchange conform its procedures for settling disciplinary actions to those now in effect at
all the other major self-regulatory organizations. There would be several advantages to amending the procedures
in the manner proposed. First, it would save the substantial time and expense that is now devoted to the formal charging
process in settled cases. Second, it would give the Exchange more flexibility in negotiating the resolution of enforcement
actions. Third, conforming the Exchange's settlement procedures to those in place at the other principal self-regulatory
organizations would serve the interests of regulatory uniformity and simplicity. Finally, potential respondents
would still retain the option of following the current disciplinary procedures if they are so inclined.

2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of section
6(b)(6) in particular in that it is intended to assure that members, member firms, and member firm employees are disciplined
for rule violations.

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to require certain members of the Exchange to file Form U&hyph;5 termination
notices with the Exchange.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The Form U&hyph;5 is used by a broker-dealer to give official notice that it has terminated a registered employee.
Requiring the filing of the Form U&hyph;5 with the Exchange is consistent with the rules of other SROs and will allow
the Exchange to more precisely monitor the authority of registered persons to act on behalf of member firms and monitor
the reasons for termination.

Proposed Interpretation and Policy .03 to Rule 3 of Article VI would apply to member organizations for which the Exchange

whom the CHX is not the DEA) that are active on the CHX trading floor.

Proposed Interpretation and Policy .03 to Rule 3 of Article VI states that following the termination of a person associated
with a member in a registered capacity, such member shall promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30) calendar
days after such termination, give written notice of such termination to the Exchange on Form U&hyph;5, and concurrently
provide a copy of such notice to the person whose association has been terminated. This requirement shall only apply
to member organizations for which the Exchange is the DEA and to registered persons of other member organizations
active on the CHX trading floor.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to remove impediments and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

The MSE proposes to add an ``Interpretation and Policy'' to Article XX, Rule 23 of its Rules which would allow MSE floor
brokers to ``cross'' stock on the Exchange floor without the possibility of break-up by a specialist under certain
circumstances. The policy would apply where a broker has an order to buy and an order to sell the same stock at a price
between the disseminated Exchange market.

At present, Exchange rules require members, or member organizations, with both an order to buy and an order to sell
the same security to offer publicly such security at a price which is higher than the bid by the minimum variation permitted
in such security (generally an 1/8th) before making a transaction with himself, or itself. The ability of specialists,
in particular, to participate in agency crosses, even when they are not disseminating a bid or offer at the cross price,
greatly decreases the likelihood of immediate execution of the cross orders for order sending firms. The proposed
rule change therefore is designed to give order sending firms greater assurances that their cross orders will be executed
quickly and without interference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this proposal addresses only the circumstances under which an MSE specialist must refrain from participating
in a cross transaction, the proposal would not excuse members from the requirement to bid and offer stock as set out
in Rule 23. As such, the proposal would still permit a member in the crowd to participate at the cross price, or better,
during the bidding and offering at the post. However, a specialist would not be permitted to interfere with the cross
during the bidding and offering at a price which he is not currently disseminating in his quote.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 However, a specialist could participate in the cross at the cross price if he was previously sought out for assistance
in executing any part of the cross trade.

Conversely, this proposal would allow a specialist who has a disseminated bid or offer at the cross price to participate
at that cross price, even in a size greater then the specialist's disseminated market. Telephone conversation between

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule, a customer order in the book could not be ``disadvantaged'' by a cross transaction because
the proposal would apply only to crosses at prices between the disseminated Exchange market. Moreover, the Exchange's
existing rules of priority and precedence would not be affected in any way under this proposal. Therefore, even though
a specialist would be precluded from participating with a cross at a price between his disseminated market, he would
still be required to satisfy orders in this book at the cross price, even if those orders are not being disseminated
through an oversight on the part of the specialist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed rule would apply to only floor-brokered orders where neither order is for the account of a member
or member organization.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rule would apply to all agency crosses regardless of size.

The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, in that it is designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to remove impediments to and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market
system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

The Exchange received one comment letter in opposition to the proposed rule change from an Exchange specialist. However,
the Exchange's Committee on Floor Procedure has approved the proposed rule change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Exchange,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 on October 20, 1992, the Exchange received a comment letter from an Exchange specialist in opposition to the proposed
rule change. The commentator opposes the rule change for several reasons. Specifically, the commentator states
that the proposed rule does not provide for the protection of customer orders; that the proposed rule is not necessary
because there is not a problem now except for a few specialists; that the proposed rule will be subject to abuse because
of the inability to determine whether or not the crosses are really agency crosses on an immediate basis; that the Exchange
should be encouraging more orders and less crosses; and that, as a result of the new rule, specialists will not be able
to participate, among other things.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
See Amendment No. 1, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
supra
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange believes that the commentator's concerns are misplaced. First, the proposed rule change will not interfere
with public orders in the book. Customer orders will continue to be protected under the proposed rule, even if, through
oversight, they are not displaced. The specialist must fill a customer order at the limited price even if an agency
cross takes place at the limit price. This should also encourage specialists to be more efficient in displaying customer
orders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the proposal will encourage more institutional trades to be sent to the floor; whether this will result in
more revenue to the Exchange is a secondary consideration. The proposal will provide a more attractive marketplace
for institutional orders without sacrificing traditional agency/auction principles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the potential that some firms may abuse the rule by not having an agency order on both sides of the trade is not
an argument for not having the rule. There are literally dozens of rules in place today which inherently cannot be surveilled
on an immediate basis to monitor compliance. If the Exchange finds that firms are abusing the rule, it will take appropriate
action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the proposed rule does not reduce the possibility of order interaction on the floor. The specialist is the
only one who cannot participate in a cross if he is not displaying his market at the cross price; this should encourage
specialists to quote their true markets. The requirement for a firm with agency orders to cross to bid or offer at the
post still remains and any other interest in the crowd can participate. It is only the specialist who cannot, unless
he is quoting at the cross price or unless he has been previously solicited for his help. This is not a major departure
from agency auction principles and should encourage more orders to the Exchange floor to participate in the auction
process.

On July 31, 1991, Columbia and Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary which is not an applicant-declarant

Columbia LNG owns and is currently maintaining in a standby mode a one Bcf per day liquefied natural gas (``LNG'') importation
terminal at Cove Point, Maryland (``Terminal''). Columbia LNG also owns and operates an 87-miles, 36-inch natural
gas pipeline from Cove Point to Loudoun County, Virginia (``Pipeline,'' collectively, the ``Facility''). Columbia
owns 90.8% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Columbia LNG, and Shell LNG Company (``Shell LNG'') owns the
balance (9.2%).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia LNG and PEPCO Enterprises, Inc. (``PEI''), a wholly owned subsidiary of Potomac Electric Power Company
(``PEPCO''), a public-utility company unaffiliated with Columbia, have agreed to develop a peak shaving service
(``Peaking'') at the Terminal.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The business plan contemplates the use of the Terminal's existing storage tanks, vaporization equipment, and other
plant infrastructure to provide the Peaking service. A liquefaction facility (``Liquefaction Unit'') would be
constructed at the Terminal to liquefy natural gas received from Peaking customers for storage in the existing tanks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A peak shaving facility has the ability to deliver large amounts of gas on very short notice over brief periods of time
for use on occasions, such as very cold winter days or very hot summer days, when such increased supplies are needed
to meet the requirements of heating or electric generating customers. Peaking service is distinguishable from storage
service because storage is typically designed to provide meaningful deliveries of natural gas on a more frequent
basis over a longer period of time, e.g., 120 days.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants-declarants propose that, a limited partnership between Columbia LNG and a subsidiary of PEI, Cove Point
Energy Company (``Partnership'') will: (i) Own and operate the Facility; (ii) provide Peaking and pipeline transportation
services; and (iii) pursue the implementation of an ongoing baseload LNG import trade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Partnership agreement will provide for the contribution of the Facility (including specified associated rights
and liabilities) by Columbia LNG to the Partnership, and for PEI's contribution to the Partnership of up to $25 million
which will consist of $10 million in cash to the Partnership in the form of equity plus a $15 million loan secured by the
assets of the Partnership. The transfer of assets and PEI's contribution of capital would take place at a closing to
occur on a date after all necessary regulatory approvals are obtained and certain conditions precedent are satisfied
(``Construction Capital Closing''). Columbia LNG and PEI, either directly or through subsidiaries, will each obtain
a 50% interest and equal voting rights in the Partnership. Applicants-declarants expect that Columbia LNG will hold
a limited partner interest and a general partner interest either directly or indirectly through one or more new, wholly
owned subsidiaries of Columbia LNG (``CLG Subsidiaries'') that will be the operator of, and/or hold partnership
interests in, the Partnership.

PEI's equity contributions and loan proceeds will be used for recommissioning the Facility (including building
the Liquefaction Unit and related equipment), operating and maintenance expenses, and working capital. Amounts
in excess of $25 million necessary prior to the completion of the recommissioning of the Facility, including any necessary
construction backstop and working capital, will be provided by Columbia LNG and/or the CLG Subsidiaries, as an equity
contribution, up to $7.0 million.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By Commission order dated September 29, 1993 (HCAR No. 25896) (``September Order''), Columbia and Columbia LNG were
authorized to defer principal and interest payments on Columbia LNG's long- and short-term debt for the period September
30, 1993 through February 28, 1994. The aggregate amount of such deferred principal and interest payments is estimated
to be $3.8 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia and Columbia LNG now propose to continue to defer principal and interest payments on Columbia LNG's long-
and short-term debt for the period March 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994, or Construction Capital Closing, whichever
is earlier. The aggregate amount of such principal and interest payments proposed to be deferred is $7.9 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia and Columbia LNG propose to proceed immediately upon Commission approval and prior to the issuance of the
additional common stock by Columbia LNG to reduce the par value of Columbia LNG's common stock from $25 to $1 and increase
the number of Columbia LNG's authorized shares to up to 15,000,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accomplishing this reduction in par value would involve the following steps: (i) Columbia LNG's certificate of incorporation
would be amended to reduce the common stock's par value from $25.00 per share to $1.00 per share and to increase the number
of Columbia LNG's authorized shares to up to 15,000,000; and (ii) the value of Columbia LNG's stated capital would
be reduced by up to $24.00 per share of common stock outstanding, and such amount would be transferred to additional
paid in capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia and Columbia LNG also propose to proceed immediately after Construction Capital Closing with a recapitalization
of Columbia LNG to establish a 100% equity capital structure for Columbia LNG. To effect this recapitalization, Columbia
and Columbia LNG propose that Columbia make a capital contribution to Columbia LNG of up to $48.1 million of installment
promissory notes and short-term debt. An additional amount up to $3.9 million would also be contributed which would
consist of accrued interest to the effective date of the recapitalization deferred pursuant to this application-declaration
and the interest which was deferred pursuant to the September Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia LNG also proposes to contribute the Facility to the Partnership at Construction Capital Closing in exchange
for a 50% interest in the Partnership to be held directly by Columbia LNG and/or indirectly through one or more of the
CLG Subsidiaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, Columbia LNG and Columbia propose that through December 31, 1995, Columbia LNG offer to issue and sell to
Columbia and Shell LNG, in proportion to their respective common stock holdings in Columbia LNG, up to 7,000,000 shares
of common stock, $1 par value, in an aggregate amount up to $7.0 million. The up to $7.0 million, together with funds
on hand and anticipated tax benefits, will (i) provide for the continued operation and maintenance of the Facility
pending Columbia LNG's contribution of the Facility to the Partnership; (ii) provide for continued expenditure
of developmental costs prior to Construction Capital Closing; (iii) provide for any direct and indirect Columbia
LNG cash capital contributions to the Partnership, including the recommissioning costs, if any, and (iv) provide
for all other operating requirements of Columbia LNG through December 31, 1995. If Shell LNG chooses not to purchase
any common stock, the entire amount up to $7.0 million will be purchased by Columbia, with a corresponding increase
in Columbia's ownership of Columbia LNG. Some or all of the additional developmental costs incurred prior to Construction
Capital Closing may be reimbursed to Columbia LNG by Cove Point Energy Company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia LNG also proposes to create and fund the CLG Subsidiaries which will be operator of, and/or hold interests
as partners in, the Partnership. At the time of the Construction Capital Closing, Columbia LNG anticipates transferring
all current Columbia LNG employees to one or more of the CLG Subsidiaries which will hire additional employees as necessary
to undertake day-to-day responsibility for operation of the various Partnership assets. The Partnership will reimburse
the operator for all costs incurred by it in such operations and pay the operator certain management fees. After this
transfer, Columbia LNG's principal assets will consist of its Partnership interest and its common stock holdings
in the CLG Subsidiaries. To fund the CLG Subsidiaries' operating requirements through December 31, 1995, Columbia
LNG proposes to acquire from the CLG Subsidiaries in the aggregate up to $1.0 million of common stock, $1 par value,
to be issued and sold by the CLG Subsidiaries.

Privacy Act of 1974; Altered System of Records
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the Department of State proposes to alter an existing system of records, STATE&hyph;51,
pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(r)) and the Office of Management and
Budget Circular No. A&hyph;130, Appendix I. The Department's report was filed with the Office of Management and Budget
on January 14, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is proposed that the current system ``Classification/Declassification Center Part-Time Employee Records''
be renamed ``Office of Freedom of Information, Privacy and Classification Review WAE Re-employed Annuitants and
Contractor Records, STATE&hyph;51.'' Also proposed are revisions and/or additions to the classification, the
categories of individuals and records covered by the system, authority for maintenance, routine uses, retrievability,
safeguards, retention and disposal, system manager, notification procedure, record access and amendment procedures,
and record source categories. These changes to the existing system description are proposed in order to reflect more
accurately the Office of Freedom of Information, Privacy and Classification Review's enhanced record-keeping
system and a reorganization of its activities and operations. Any persons interested in commenting on the altered
system of records may do so by submitting comments in writing to Margaret P. Grafeld, Chief, Privacy, Plans and Appeals
Division, Office of Freedom of Information, Privacy and Classification Review, Room 1239, Department of State,
2201 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20520&hyph;1239. This system of records will be effective forty days from the date
of publication (March 9, 1994), unless we receive comments which will result in a contrary determination. The ``Office
of Freedom of Information, Privacy and Classification Review WAE Re-employed Annuitants and Contractor Records,
STATE&hyph;51,'' will read as set forth below.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces that the FAA finds that the noise exposure maps submitted for Kissimmee Municipal Airport are
in compliance with applicable requirements of part 150, effective January 11, 1994. Further, FAA is reviewing a proposed
noise compatibility program for that airport which will be approved or disapproved on or before July 10, 1994. This
notice also announces the availability of this program for public review and comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 103 of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which
depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations,
and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation
with interested and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The City of Kissimmee submitted to the FAA on December 2, 1993, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation
which were produced during development of the Kissimmee Municipal Airport FAR Part 150 Noise Study between July 1,
1991, and November 29, 1993. It was requested that the FAA review this material as the noise exposure maps, as described
in section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and
surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program under section 104(b) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by the City of Kissimmee.
The specific maps under consideration are ``Existing (1992) Noise Contours on Existing Land Use'' and ``Alternate
5 Recommended Future (1997) Noise Contours on Existing Land Use'' in the submission. The FAA has determined that these
maps for Kissimmee Municipal Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination is effective
on January 11, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a funding that
the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR part 150. Such determination
does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility
program or to fund the implementation of that program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act.
The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under &sect;150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutorily
required consultation has been accomplished.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for Kissimmee Municipal Airport, also effective on
January 11, 1994. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for
the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval
of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before July
10, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150, &sect;150.33. The primary
considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety,
create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing
existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments,
other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.
Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program
are available for examination at the following locations:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Although the Renegotiation Board is no longer in existence, other Federal Agencies are required to use interest rates
computed under the criteria established by the Renegotiation Act of 1971 (P.L. 92&hyph;41). For example, the Contracts
Disputes Act of 1978 (P.L. 95&hyph;563) and the Prompt Payment Act (P.L. 97&hyph;177) are required to calculate interest
due on claims at a rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Public Law 92&hyph;41 (85 Stat. 97)
for the Renegotiation Board (31 U.S.C. 3902).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the above mentioned sections, the Secretary of the Treasury has
determined that the rate of interest applicable for the purpose of said sections, for the period beginning January
1, 1994 and ending on June 30, 1994, is 51/2 per centum per annum.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States Trade Representative (``USTR'') is seeking further public comment on acts, policies and practices
of the Government of Brazil concerning the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in that country.
In particular, USTR seeks public comment on whether such acts, policies or practices are unreasonable and burden
or restrict U.S. commerce, and if so, what responsive action, if any, should be taken pursuant to section 301 of the
Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Trade Act'').

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On May 28, 1993, the USTR initiated an investigation of deficiencies in the acts, policies and practices of the Government
of Brazil (Brazil) related to the denial of adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights in
Brazil. See 58 FR 31788 (June 4, 1993). Since that time, four rounds of bilateral discussions have been held to resolve
these issues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the context of these discussions, the Government of Brazil indicated that it has undertaken and will undertake
as part of its domestic reform efforts a number of actions to improve the protection of intellectual property in Brazil,
and to provide greater market access for products relying on the protection of intellectual property. These include
progress in the areas of protection for trademarks, semiconductor mask works (layout designs), and computer programs;
market access for computer programs; and improvements in the enforcement of intellectual property rights, including
efforts regarding the importation of pirated and counterfeit goods and the penalties of infringement of intellectual
property rights.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, additional issues remain to be resolved. These include, among other things, full implementation of the
Uruguay Round Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPs) text, most importantly with respect to patents,
trade secrets, copyrights and semiconductor layout designs. The two governments are also discussing issues related
to fair and equitable access to the Brazilian market for U.S. industries that rely on intellectual property protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original deadline for determinations under section 304(a)(1) of the Trade Act with respect to the investigation
was November 28, 1993. Because the issues that remained outstanding at that time were complex and required additional
time for resolution, the deadline by which the determinations must be made was extended until February 28, 1994. See
58 FR 64351 (December 6, 1993). In accordance with section 304(b)(1)(A) of the Trade Act, USTR invites the presentation
of views of interested persons concerning the foregoing determinations. In particular, USTR would like written
comments on whether the Government of Brazil's acts, policies or practices with respect to the outstanding issues
noted above are unreasonable and constitute a burden or restriction on U.S. commerce, and, if so, on what actions,
if any, would be appropriate. The United States in the past has determined that removal of Generalized System of Preferences
benefits and/or increased tariff rates are appropriate after a determination has been made that a trading partner
fails to provide adequate protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice confirms that 40 CFR part 61, subpart I, is presently in effect for two categories: (1) Facilities licensed
by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or NRC Agreement States except for commercial nuclear power reactors
and (2) all federal facilities not operated by the Department of Energy (DOE). The effectiveness of Subpart I is presently
stayed for commercial nuclear power reactors. The previous stay of Subpart I for NRC and Agreement State licensees
other than nuclear power reactors expired on November 15, 1992, and has not been extended or renewed. All NRC and Agreement
State licensees other than nuclear power reactors, as well as federal facilities not operated by DOE, are now subject
to all applicable provisions of subpart I. Each affected facility must demonstrate compliance for calendar year
1993 with the annual emission standard set forth in 40 CFR 61.102, utilizing the procedures specified in 40 CFR 61.103.
Those facilities which are not exempt from reporting requirements under 40 CFR 61.104(b) must submit the annual report
concerning emissions for calendar year 1993 required by 40 CFR 61.104(a) to EPA by March 31, 1994. Facilities that
are unable to gather the necessary information and report to EPA by March 31, 1994 should request an extension from
the appropriate EPA regional office. EPA will consider extensions of up to 60 days.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 31, 1989, EPA promulgated National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS) to control
radionuclide emissions to the ambient air from several source categories. This rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 15, 1989 (54 FR 51654).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart I limits radionuclide emissions to the ambient air from NRC-licensed facilities to that amount which would
cause any member of the public to receive in any year an effective dose equivalent (ede) of 10 millirem, of which no more
than 3 millirem ede may be from radioiodines. These limits involved application to radionuclide emissions of the
Agency's policy for regulating section 112 pollutants which was first announced in the benzene NESHAP (54 FR 38044
September 14, 1989), and utilized the two-step process outlined in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
decision). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of promulgation of the radionuclide NESHAPS rule, EPA granted reconsideration of subpart I based on information
received late in the rulemaking from the NRC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NRC was concerned about
duplicative regulation of its licensees by NRC and EPA, while the NIH was concerned with the potential negative effects
of the standard on the use of nuclear medicine in patient treatment. EPA subsequently extended the stay of the effective
date of subpart I on several occasions, pursuant to the authority provided by section 10(d) of the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 705, and section 301(a) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7601(a). (55 FR 10455, March 21,
1990; 55 FR 29205, July 18, 1990; and 55 FR 38057, September 17, 1990). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, Congress enacted legislation comprehensively amending the Clean Air Act, which included a section addressing
the issue of regulatory duplication between EPA and NRC. Section 112(d)(9) of the CAA provides, that no standard for
radionuclide emissions from any category or subcategory of facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(or an Agreement State) is required to be promulgated under Section 112 if the Administrator determines, by rule,
and after consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that the regulatory program established by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act for such category or subcategory provides an ample margin
of safety to protect the public health. This provision enables EPA to eliminate duplication of effort between EPA
and NRC so long as public health is protected with an ample margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 24, 1991, EPA issued a final rule staying until November 15, 1992 the effectiveness of subpart I for all categories
of facilities licensed by the NRC or NRC Agreement States except nuclear power reactors (56 FR 18735). The purpose
of this stay was to avoid the costs and disruption associated with formal implementation of subpart I while EPA was
collecting additional information necessary to make the substantive determination for these facilities contemplated
by CAA Section 112(d)(9). NESHAPS Rulemaking on Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Agreement State Licensees Other
Than Nuclear Power Reactors, EPA 430&hyph;R&hyph;92&hyph;011 (November 1992). (On August 5, 1991, EPA proposed
to rescind subpart I for commercial nuclear power reactors (56 FR 37196) and issued a final rule staying the effectiveness
of subpart I for nuclear power reactors during the pendency of the substantive rulemaking on rescission (56 FR 37158)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) petitioned for judicial review of the rule staying subpart I for NRC
and Agreement State licensees other than nuclear power reactors. On September 25, 1992, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals
issued a decision holding that EPA had exceeded its authority by staying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart I while it was collecting the information required to make a finding under CAA section 112(d)(9).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA completed its investigation of radionuclide emissions by NRC and Agreement State licensees other than nuclear
power reactors while the litigation in the DC Circuit Court concerning the rule staying subpart I for these facilities
was still pending. On September 18, 1992, EPA announced that it intended to propose rescission of subpart I for these
facilities and proposed a rule which would further stay subpart I during the pendency of the substantive rulemaking
on rescission (57 FR 43173). Although EPA did propose to rescind subpart I for NRC and Agreement State licensees other
than nuclear power reactors on December 1, 1992 (57 FR 56877), EPA did not adopt the proposed stay. EPA concluded that
the Court's ruling in

had left substantial doubt concerning the legality of any further stay of subpart I for these facilities and decided
not to issue any further stay. As a result, the rule staying subpart I for NRC and Agreement State licensees other than
nuclear power reactors expired by its own terms on November 15, 1992, and subpart I took effect for these facilities
on November 16, 1992 (the official mandate implementing the DC Circuit Court's decision in

II. Implementation of Subpart I as Applied to NRC-Licensed Facilities Other Than Nuclear Power Reactors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subpart I became effective on November 16, 1992 for all categories of facilities licensed by NRC or Agreement States
except for commercial nuclear power reactors. Subpart I was already in effect prior to that time for federal facilities
not operated by DOE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, EPA has not taken final administrative action concerning the rule to rescind subpart I for NRC and Agreement
State licensees other than commercial nuclear power reactors which it proposed on December 1, 1992. EPA is recommending
that NRC make certain changes in its regulatory program in order to fully support the substantive finding which is
required by CAA Section 112(d)(9) before EPA may rescind subpart I for NRC licensees other than commercial nuclear
power reactors. EPA and NRC are presently engaged in consultations concerning specific actions which would strengthen
the basis for rescission of subpart I for this category, but it is unlikely that any agreement between EPA and NRC concerning
additional measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could be implemented quickly. While the rulemaking concerning rescission is still pending, EPA advises all facilities
not to presume that EPA will take any particular action in that rulemaking and to proceed in the meantime with all legally
required compliance activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because subpart I first took effect for NRC and Agreement State licensees other than nuclear power reactors near the
end of 1992, EPA has determined that affected facilities were not required to demonstrate compliance with subpart
I for calendar year 1992. However, each NRC or Agreement State licensee, as well as each federal facility not operated
by DOE, is now subject to all provisions of subpart I. Each affected facility must demonstrate compliance for calendar
year 1993 with the annual emission standard set forth in 40 CFR 61.102, utilizing the procedures specified in 40 CFR
61.103. Those facilities which are not exempt from reporting requirements under 40 CFR 61.104(b) must submit the
annual report concerning emissions for calendar year 1993 required by 40 CFR 61.104(a) to EPA by March 31, 1994. Facilities
that are unable to gather the necessary information and report to EPA by March 31, 1994 should request an extension
from the appropriate EPA regional office listed below. EPA will consider extensions of up to 60 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 40 CFR 61.04, all requests, reports, applications, submittals, and other communications to EPA pursuant
to the standards in subpart I should be submitted in duplicate to the appropriate Regional Office of the EPA to the attention
of the Director of the Division indicated in the following list of EPA Regional Offices:
