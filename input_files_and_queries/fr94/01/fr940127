SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Inter-American Foundation (``Foundation''), with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE),
is issuing regulations for employees of the Foundation that supplement the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees
of the Executive Branch at 5 CFR part 2635. The Foundation is also repealing its regulations that were superseded by
these standards and by the executive branch-wide financial disclosure regulations at 5 CFR part 2634.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 7, 1992, the Office of Government Ethics published a final rule entitled ``Standards of Ethical Conduct
for Employees of the Executive Branch'' (Standards). See 57 FR 35006&hyph;35067, as corrected at 57 FR 48557 and 57
FR 52583. The Standards, codified at 5 CFR part 2635 and effective February 3, 1993, established uniform standards
of ethical conduct that apply to all executive branch personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the concurrence of OGE, 5 CFR 2635.105 authorizes executive branch agencies to publish agency-specific supplemental
regulations necessary to implement their respective ethics programs. The Foundation, with OGE's concurrence,
has determined that the following supplemental regulations, being codified in part 7301 of new chapter LXIII of 5
CFR, are necessary to the successful implementation of the Foundation's ethics program. By this rulemaking, the
Foundation is also repealing its regulations at 22 CFR part 1001 which have been superseded by the Standards and by
OGE regulations at 5 CFR part 2634, Executive Branch Financial Disclosure, Qualified Trusts, and Certificates of
Divestiture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Analysis of the Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7301.101&blank;General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
New &sect;7301.101(a) of 5 CFR explains that the supplemental regulations apply to employees of the Inter-American
Foundation, with the exception of members of the Foundation's Board of Directors and Advisory Council, and supplement
the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch contained in 5 CFR part 2635. Section 7301.101(a)
also provides a cross-reference to the executive branch-wide financial disclosure regulations contained in 5 CFR
part 2634. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The head of each executive branch agency is required by 5 CFR 2638.202(b) to appoint a designated agency ethics official
and an alternate agency ethics official to carry out the duties specified in 5 CFR 2638.203. Section 7301.101(b) specifies
that the Foundation's General Counsel will serve as its designated agency ethics official and that the Deputy General
Counsel will serve as the alternate agency ethics official. Section 7301.102 of these supplemental regulations
gives the designated agency ethics official and the alternate the additional responsibility of approving requests
for prior approval to engage in compensated outside teaching, speaking and writing activities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7301.102&blank;Prior Approval for Outside Teaching, Speaking and Writing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 5 CFR 2635.803, an agency that determines it is necessary or desirable for the purpose of administering its ethics
program may, by supplemental regulation, require its employees to obtain prior approval before engaging in specific
types of outside activities. Under 22 CFR 1001.5(c), which is being repealed by this final rule, the Foundation has
required its employees to obtain prior approval to engage in outside teaching, lecturing or writing. To ensure compliance
with the executive branch-wide limitations on teaching, speaking and writing at 5 CFR 2635.807, and based on its experiences
with the similar requirement that has been in effect under 22 CFR 1001.5(c), the Foundation has determined that it
is desirable for the administration of its ethics program to continue to require Foundation employees to obtain prior
approval to engage in compensated teaching, speaking and writing. Section 7301.102 (a), thus, imposes such a requirement
for prior approval by the designated agency ethics official or the alternate agency ethics official. To ensure that
approval is granted in accordance with applicable standards, 5 CFR 7301.102(b) provides that approval shall be granted
only upon a determination that the outside teaching, speaking or writing is not expected to involve conduct prohibited
by statute or Federal regulations, including 5 CFR part 2635. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Repeal of Foundation Employee Responsibilities and Conduct Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the Foundation's regulations on Employees Responsibilities and Conduct have been superseded by the new
executive branch standards of ethical conduct and financial disclosure regulations, 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635, the
Foundation is repealing all of existing 22 CFR part 1001. To ensure that Foundation employees are on notice of the ethical
standards and financial disclosure requirements to which they are subject, the Foundation is replacing its old standards
at 22 CFR part 1001 with a new standard at 22 CFR 1001.1 which cross-references 5 CFR parts 2634 and 2635, as well as the
Foundation's supplemental regulations at 5 CFR part 7301.

IV. Matters of Regulatory Procedure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Administrative Procedure Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553 (b) and (d)(3)), the Foundation has found that good
cause exists for waiving as unnecessary and contrary to the public interest, the general notice of proposed rulemaking
and the 30-day delay in effectiveness as to the rules and repeals. Public comment is unnecessary because these regulations
merely revoke existing regulations in accordance with previously issued Government-wide regulations and make
non-substantive amendments. In addition, since these regulations relate to agency management and personnel they
are exempt from notice and comment under 5 U.S.C. 553 (a)(2).

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In promulgating these final regulations, the Foundation has adhered to the regulatory philosophy and the applicable
principles of regulation set forth in section 1 of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review. These regulations
have not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Executive order, as they deal with agency organization,
management, and personnel matters and are not, in any event, deemed ``significant'' thereunder.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Foundation has determined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) that these regulations will not have a significant impact on small business entities because they affect only Foundation
employees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title XII, section 1237 of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, was amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 to specify the number of acres the Secretary of Agriculture shall enroll in the Wetlands Reserve Program
(WRP). This interim rule amends the regulations governing the WRP to comply with statutory changes; expand the number
of participating States from 9 States to 20 States; revise the process by which the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service (ASCS) enrolls acreage in the WRP; and provide other changes based on experience in administering
the 1992 Pilot WRP.

The current regulations in 7 CFR part 703, published as a final rule on June 4, 1992 (57 FR 23908), implemented the 1992
pilot WRP, which is authorized by title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended (1985 Act). Under the WRP, ASCS
will purchase easements, in lump-sum payments, from persons owning cropland who voluntarily agree to restore and
protect farmed wetlands, prior converted croplands, substantially altered lands, and eligible adjacent acres.
Fund and acreage allocations will be provided to States based on landowner interest and other factors as determined
by the Deputy Administrator, State and County Operations, ASCS, in consultation with the Soil Conservation Service
and the Fish and Wildlife Service. Land eligible for enrollment in the WRP includes farmed wetlands, prior converted
croplands, but not lands converted after December 23, 1985, or substantially altered lands, together with adjacent
lands on which the wetlands are functionally dependent so long as the likelihood of successful restoration of such
land and the wetland values merit inclusion in the program taking into account the cost of restoring the wetlands.
ASCS is also permitted to include in the program: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Farmed wetlands, prior converted croplands, or substantially altered lands and adjoining lands which are enrolled
in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), as authorized by title XII of the 1985 Act, with the highest wetland functions
and values and that are likely to return to production at the end of the CRP contract; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Other wetlands that would not otherwise be eligible if it is determined that inclusion in the program would add
to the value of the easement; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Riparian areas that link wetlands which are protected by easements or by some other device or circumstance that
achieves the same purpose as an easement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Landowners are not eligible to receive funding under both the Emergency Conservation Program (ECP) and the WRP on
the same acreage. ECP payments received on acreage offered for WRP must be refunded, provided the ECP practice is still
within its lifespan provisions, before any WRP payment will be disbursed.

During fiscal year 1992, WRP was authorized in the following States: California, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, New York, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. Section 1237 of the 1985 Act was amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation
Act of 1993 to specify that the Secretary shall enroll in the WRP a total of not less than 330,000 acres by the end of 1995
and a total of not less than 975,000 acres during 1991 through 2000. Congress has appropriated $66,675,000 to be used
to enroll no more than 75,000 acres in fiscal year 1994.

who have eligible land with respect to which they agree to restore and protect farmed wetlands, prior converted croplands,
or substantially altered lands, and eligible adjacent lands. Such voluntary easements will be for the purpose of
restoring the hydrology and vegetation and protecting the functions and values of wetlands for wildlife habitat,
water quality improvement, flood water retention, ground water recharge, open space, aesthetic values, environmental
education, and other values determined appropriate by ASCS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its regulations to require Multi-Family Housing (MFH) reserve accounts
be subject to countersignature by an Agency official before funds can be withdrawn. Internal Agency reviews and audits
conducted by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) indicate reserve funds are being improperly used. The intended
effect of this action is to curtail reserve fund abuses.

We are issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and we have determined that it is not a ``significant
regulatory action.'' Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this final rule: (1)
Would have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities; (3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an
action taken or planned by another agency; (4) would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user
fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and (5) would not raise novel legal or policy
issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.

Discussion

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is improving FmHA oversight of MFH reserve accounts by requiring them to be subject to countersignature
in a supervised account. Reserve accounts were previously required to be funded and used in accordance with Agency
regulations, which already required the prior consent of the Agency prior to withdrawing reserve funds. However,
internal Agency reviews and audits conducted by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), highlighted various violations
of Agency regulations and prompted the need for this final rulemaking action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the most common concerns uncovered to date include the withdrawal of reserve funds without Agency consent,
funds being pledged as security for other loans without Agency knowledge, withdrawal of interest earned on reserve
funds for non-project purposes, lenders withdrawing funds for application on other defaulted loans, reserve funds
withdrawn at a lending institution for application on other debts, and reserve accounts held at a lending institution
for a short period of time before transferring to another institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency expects to curtail reserve fund abuses by shifting emphasis to compliance through procedures aimed at
preventing abuses (e.g., requiring the countersignature of Agency officials for withdrawal of reserve funds which
are to be placed in a supervised account). The Agency's earlier procedures relied on oversight through monitoring
routines, with the threat of potential punitive measures being imposed should violations be discovered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency solicited comments concerning the impact of the proposed rules on those holding reserve funds in money
market accounts, bonds, or financial holdings other than in checking or savings accounts in federally insured institutions.
The prior rulemaking action also mentioned that the Agency is aware that the proposed rule may result in some borrowers
having to pay financial fees or penalties, which will erode reserve funds, and is concerned that such adverse impacts
be minimized to the extent practical. The Agency also solicited other alternative approaches to curtail reserve
account abuses. The Agency desires to ensure that the rules to reduce reserve account abuses are met in a practical
manner without inadvertently imposing severe financial hardship on existing borrowers.

Discussion of Comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 39631&hyph;39635) on September 1, 1992, providing for a 60-day comment period ending November 2, 1992. The
Agency received 25 comments in response to its proposed rulemaking action. A high number of commentors indicated
the rulemaking was not needed because existing regulations were adequate if properly enforced. Some commentors
were supportive of the rulemaking action. Comments were received about the potential abuse of the authority granted
to FmHA field representatives, that the rulemaking action would cause undue delays for approval, impose more work
on existing staff, and possibly warrant requiring fidelity bonds by Agency personnel. Some commentors suggested

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives to the proposed rulemaking action, such as requiring all reserve funds be remitted to the Government
for holding under its accounting system until such time as a request is approved for a withdrawal, requiring cosignatories
only for problem accounts, requiring only some reserve funds to be subject to withdrawal, relying on account statements
from financial institutions only, and withholding any authorized return on owners' investment for any year in which
reserve accounts abuses occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency considered the various alternatives and determined the proposed rulemaking action was needed and would
not impose an undue hardship on borrowers. The alternatives suggested did not warrant adoption by the Agency. The
Agency does not deem it wise to require reserves to be remitted to the Government, and also finds such an alternative
to be administratively undesirable, in part because the considerable accounting software modifications needed
would make it cumbersome to implement. Requiring co-signatures only for problem accounts is not attractive because
it does not fully accomplish an Agency objective of ensuring abuses are prevented, rather than relying on punitive
measures. The Agency considers its existing policies to be adequate to impose appropriate punitive measures for
those who are trying to meet program objectives; however, abuses are still occurring and preventive steps are deemed
necessary. Relying on added review of statements from financial institutions does not fully accomplish an Agency
objective of ensuring abuses are prevented, rather than increasingly relying on Agency monitoring to discover and
punish abuses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A high number of commentors indicated that it was important that the Agency be required to act timely on requests for
reserve fund withdrawals, especially where emergency repairs are needed. The Agency expects its employees to take
timely action on reserve account withdrawal requests, especially where emergency cases arise. The Agency normally
expects such requests to be acted on within 5 working days of the request (See 7 CFR part 1930, subpart C). However, the
Agency does not agree that this is a valid reason to drop the proposed countersignature provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency regulations have long required prior consent before reserve account funds are used. When circumstances arose
where emergency repairs were needed during non-federal working hours for which no cash was on hand to pay for the repairs,
operators ensured such repairs were made using commonly available business practices. Operators can normally request
the work be billed for payment within 30 days, or that the work be paid via the extension of credit arrangements. Such
work is then able to be repaid at a later date, either through the authorized release of reserve funds for authorized
purposes, or through an alternative revenue source such as project rents. However, the Agency recognized the need
to permit the post approval of commitments made (e.g., work committed under credit arrangements, etc.) in emergency
cases. The Agency modified 7 CFR part 1930, subpart C at paragraph XIII B 2 c (5) as a result of similar comments in a separate
but related rulemaking action to accommodate such treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A large number of respondents also recommended requiring at least two Agency employees to be authorized to countersign
for reserve account withdrawals to ensure that prompt action can be taken should employees be on travel or leave. Although
the Agency understands it may be desirable to ensure that at least two officials are authorized to countersign for
reserve account withdrawals, it may be impractical to require multiple counter-signatures by authorized Agency
officials in some circumstances. The Agency does not object to accommodating multiple counter-signatures. However,
it does not desire to require multiple signatures, in part, because normal business practices should not demand extremely
prompt action on reserve withdrawal requests even when emergency situations occur. There are ample means of handling
emergencies in a prompt manner other than by relying solely on the immediate access to reserve account funds. Also,
some FmHA offices do not have two qualified employees to authorize reserve fund withdrawals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency received a number of comments regarding the use of reserve accounts. The information published in the reserve
section was basically the same as published in a separate, but related, prior rulemaking action on 7 CFR part 1930,
subpart C. Changes resulting from that rulemaking action were separately addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wording proposed at paragraph XIII B 2 c (2) of Exhibit B of part 1930, subpart C, is being adopted with a modification
of the implementation date. The Agency is modifying the effective date to be 180 days after publication of the final
rule instead of 60 days. This was deemed necessary because of the significant number of commentors who indicated that
establishing accounts requiring countersignature by Agency officials would be cumbersome to implement, especially
if implemented over a short timeframe. The Agency agrees and is providing for a longer implementation period. The
paragraph also provides that reserve funds held just prior to the effective date, in instruments which are subject
to monetary penalties for early withdrawal, may be temporarily held for the time needed to avoid such penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A comment was received concerning whether borrowers whose accounts were established on or before October 27, 1980,
would be subject to a supervised account for reserve account funds, since these accounts were not subject to the required
account standards set out in FmHA regulations for loans approved after October 27, 1980. The Agency intends all RRH,
RCH, and all LH borrowers operating projects (e.g., all LH borrowers except on-farm type borrowers) to establish
a supervised account for reserve funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received in conjunction with the prior rulemaking changes for 7 CFR part 1930, subpart C, suggested reserve
accounts be permitted to be invested in other than federally insured institutions and readily marketable obligations
of the United States Treasury. The Agency agreed to make some expansion for MFH reserve accounts as prescribed in 7
CFR part 1930, subpart C. Consequently, it is necessary to make a number of technical changes to 7 CFR part 1902, subpart
A to be compatible with these principles. Those changes would have necessitated extensive changes to numerous paragraphs
in the existing regulation. Therefore, the Agency determined the public would be better served to have a separate
section covering all regulations governing the MFH reserve accounts, instead of providing extensive exceptions
in numerous sections of the existing regulation. Section 1902.4 was added to the regulation, taking into consideration
the comments for improvements recommended by the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, a number of recommendations were offered to improve the technical implementation of any regulations
resulting from the prior rulemaking action. Comments indicated that using the term ``bank statements'' when discussing
MFH reserve accounts was not appropriate. The Agency agrees and avoided this wording when used in conjunction with
MFH reserve accounts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commentor also desired clarification as to whether originals or copies of account activity statements are expected.
The Agency will accept either for MFH reserve accounts. A commentor also desired clarification as to when the MFH supervised
account activity statements will be provided to the Agency. The Agency normally will not need account activity statements.
Accordingly, the Agency made changes to clarify this intent. Commentors also were concerned about the need and frequency
of providing MFH reserve account deposit information to the Agency. The Agency normally will not need deposit documentation.
Accordingly, the Agency made changes to clarify this intent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It was recommended that proposed rulemaking wording for &sect;1902.1(k) be modified, since it states that the ``Interest-Bearing
Deposit Agreement'' be executed in conjunction with Form FmHA 1940&hyph;1. The Agency agrees that the ``Interest-Bearing
Deposit Agreement'' need not be executed when MFH reserve accounts are involved. The Agency avoided referencing
this form when it consolidated all the MFH reserve account provisions in &sect;1902.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commentor indicated that the proposed revision to &sect;1902.2(a)(6) is not appropriately located, and suggested
adding another paragraph to cover the treatment of MFH accounts at &sect;1902.2(a). The Agency determined that the
proposed clarifying wording is appropriate to ensure it is understood that MFH accounts are to be kept in supervised
accounts as long as the borrower is indebted to the Agency. However, the Agency also agrees that additional coverage
would help convey that MFH reserve funds must be withdrawn for disbursement for an authorized purpose. Consequently,
the Agency consolidated these related provisions into &sect;1902.4.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, commentors suggested removing the word ``checking'' where it occurs throughout &sect;1902.14, in part because
credit unions and savings accounts may also be used when MFH reserve accounts are being established. The Agency agrees
and is dropping the word ``checking'' from the section governing MFH reserve funds.

This subpart prescribes the policies and procedures of the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) for disbursement
of funds under the Loan Disbursement System (LDS), in establishing and using supervised bank accounts, and in placing
Multi-Family Housing (MFH) reserve accounts in supervised bank accounts. The LDS system provides for disbursement
of funds on an as needed basis to substantially reduce interest costs to FmHA borrowers, U.S. Treasury, and FmHA.

The reserve account must be maintained in authorized financial institutions set out in subpart C of part 1930 of this
chapter (e.g., banks, savings and loan institutions, credit unions, brokerage firms, mutual funds, etc.). Generally,
any financial institution may be used provided invested or deposited funds are insured to protect against theft and
dishonesty. The reserve account funds need not be Federally insured. However, if Federally insured, any amount held
above the Federal insurance ceilings established must be backed by a pledge of collateral from the financial institution,
or otherwise covered by non-federal insurance against theft and dishonesty.

The reserve account is a required account subject to the requirements set out in this paragraph. The borrower will
initiate monthly deposits in this project account, preferably an interest bearing account, starting the same month
the first loan payment is due FmHA. As projects age, the required reserve account level may be adjusted to meet anticipated
``life-cycle'' needs, including equipment and facility replacement costs, by amending the loan agreement/resolution.
All RRH, RCH, and LH borrowers operating projects (i.e., all LH borrowers exclusive of those on-farm type LH borrowers)
are required to establish a reserve account. Effective as of July 26, 1994, reserve funds will be required to be placed
in a supervised account. The provisions of subpart A of part 1902 of this chapter apply. Reserve funds on deposit just
prior to this date in instruments which are subject to monetary penalties for early withdrawal may be temporarily
held for the time needed to avoid such penalties.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule implements section 618(b) of the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and
Improvement Act of 1991 (RTCRRIA) and amends the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines to assign a 50 percent risk
weight to loans secured by multifamily residential properties (multifamily housing loans) that meet certain prudential
criteria and to any securities collateralized by such loans. At present, such loans are assigned to the 100 percent
risk weight category. This amendment also satisfies a requirement contained in section 305 of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) concerning the application of the FDIC's risk-based capital
guidelines to multifamily housing loans. The final rule also addresses the section 618(b) requirement that the FDIC's
risk-based capital guidelines take into account loss sharing arrangements in connection with sales of multifamily
housing loans. The final rule is intended to facilitate prudent lending for multifamily housing purposes.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 14, 1989, the Board of Directors of the FDIC adopted a Statement of Policy on Risk-Based Capital (12 CFR part
325, appendix A, later redesignated as appendix A to subpart A of part 325) which is applicable to all insured state
nonmember banks supervised by the FDIC (54 FR 11500). The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal
Reserve Board (FRB) have also adopted similar risk-based capital standards for the banks under their supervision.
The three agencies based their risk-based capital standards on the report on ``International Convergence of Capital
Measurement and Capital Standards'' (the Basle Accord) issued by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision in July
1988. In addition, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) has implemented risk-based capital rules for savings associations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the FDIC's risk-based capital framework, a bank's balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of
its off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk categories_0, 20, 50, or 100 percent_according
to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. At present, absent qualifying collateral
or guarantees, claims on private sector obligors (other than depository institutions) are generally assigned to
the 100 percent risk weight category under the risk-based capital guidelines issued by the FDIC, the FRB, the OCC,
and the OTS (collectively, the federal banking agencies). Thus, multifamily (five or more dwelling units) housing
loans and privately-issued securities collateralized by multifamily housing loans are normally accorded a 100
percent risk weight by the FDIC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Multifamily housing loans are also normally accorded a 100 percent risk weight under the risk-based capital guidelines
of the FRB and OCC. However, OTS regulations accord a 50 percent risk weight to ``qualifying multifamily mortgage
loans.'' This type of loan is defined as a ``loan on an existing property consisting of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5&hyph;36 dwelling units with an initial loan-to-value ratio of not more than 80% where an average annual occupancy
rate of 80% or more of total units has existed for at least one year.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
However, under the Basle Accord, ``loans fully secured by mortgage on residential property which is rented or is (or
is intended to be) occupied by the borrower'' are permitted to be assigned a 50 percent risk weight. Nevertheless,
the Accord admonishes bank supervisory authorities to apply this ``concessionary weight *&blank;*&blank;* restrictively
and in accordance with strict prudential criteria. This may mean, for example, that in some member countries the 50
per cent. weight *&blank;*&blank;* will only be applied where strict, legally-based, valuation rules ensure a substantial
margin of additional security over the amount of the loan.'' To date, the 50 percent risk weight has been accorded only
to loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties that meet certain prudential criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 618(b)(1) of the RTCRRIA requires the federal banking agencies to amend their risk-based capital guidelines
to assign multifamily housing loans that meet certain criteria and any security collateralized by such loans to the
50 percent risk weight category. In order for a multifamily housing loan to qualify for this preferential capital
treatment, the loan must be secured by a first lien on a multifamily residential property, the loan-to-value ratio
for the property must not exceed 80 percent (75 percent if the rate of interest on the loan changes over the term of the
loan), the ratio of annual net operating income generated by the property (before debt service) to annual debt service
on the loan must not be less than 120 percent (115 percent if the rate of interest on the loan changes over the term of the
loan), the amortization period for principal and interest on the loan must not exceed 30 years, the loan must have a
minimum maturity for principal repayment of not less than seven years, and the loan must have had timely payment of
principal and interest in accordance with the loan terms for at least one year. Section 618(b)(1) further provides
that a multifamily housing loan must meet ``any other underwriting characteristics that the appropriate Federal
banking agency may establish, consistent with the purposes of the minimum acceptable capital requirements to maintain
the safety and soundness of financial institutions.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 305 of the FDICIA (Pub. L. 102&hyph;242, 105 Stat. 2355 (12 U.S.C. 1828 note)) in part requires
the federal banking agencies to amend their risk-based capital standards for insured depository institutions to
ensure that those standards ``reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss of multifamily mortgages.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 618(b)(2) of the RTCRRIA requires the FDIC to amend its risk-based capital standards:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
To provide that any loan fully secured by a first lien on a multifamily housing property that is sold subject to a pro
rata loss sharing arrangement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
*&blank;*&blank;* shall be treated as sold to the extent that loss is incurred by the purchaser of the loan.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section then defines the term ``pro rata loss sharing arrangement'' as ``an agreement providing that the purchaser
of a loan shares in any loss incurred on the loan with the selling institution on a pro rata basis.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 618(b)(3) of the RTCRRIA then directs the FDIC to amend its risk-based capital framework ``to take into account
other loss sharing arrangements in connection with the sale'' of multifamily housing loans ``for purposes of determining
the extent to which such loans shall be treated as sold.'' An ``other loss sharing arrangement'' is then defined as
``an agreement providing that the purchaser of a loan shares in any loss incurred on the loan with the selling institution
on other than a pro rata basis.''

II. Description of Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 1, 1992, the FDIC published a proposed rule designed to implement the provisions of section 618(b) of the RTCRRIA
(57 FR 11010). The preamble to the proposed rule further noted that implementation of the proposal would also satisfy
the provision of section 305 of the FDICIA concerning the application of the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines
to multifamily housing loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Criteria for Multifamily Housing Loans and Securities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to achieve the safety and soundness objective set forth in section 618(b)(1), the proposal observed that
it is imperative that appropriate criteria be established to distinguish between multifamily housing loans that
are accorded a 100 percent risk weight and those that are of sufficiently high quality to warrant a more favorable 50
percent risk weight. In this regard, the proposal noted that data reported in the Consolidated Reports of Condition
and Income filed by all FDIC-insured commercial banks revealed that net charge-offs of multifamily housing loans
by such banks for calendar year 1991 were 2.01 percent of multifamily housing loans outstanding. The percentage of
multifamily housing loans that were 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status as of December 31, 1991, for all
FDIC-insured commercial banks was 5.64 percent of multifamily housing loans outstanding. In contrast, for single
family housing loans, which the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines assign to the 50 percent risk weight category
if they meet certain criteria, the net charge-off rate for calendar year 1991 was only 0.20 percent of loans outstanding.
Single family housing loans that were 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status as of December 31, 1991, for all
FDIC-insured commercial banks were 1.65 percent.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, the FDIC's proposed rule lowering the risk weight for certain multifamily housing loans incorporated the specific
statutory criteria described in section I. above and also included four additional safety and soundness criteria
that multifamily housing loans would have to meet in order to receive a reduced risk weight. These four criteria, which
were developed by the FDIC after consulting with the other federal banking agencies, provided that: (1) The loan-to-value
ratio used to determine the eligibility of a multifamily housing loan for the lower risk weight would be the ratio at
the time the loan was originated; (2) the loan must not be more than 90 days past due or carried in nonaccrual status;
(3) the average annual occupancy rate of the property securing the loan must have been at least 80 percent for at least
one year; and (4) the loan must have been made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards. Taken together,
the statutory and proposed additional criteria were intended to ensure that only those multifamily housing loans
whose future repayment prospects are such that they expose an institution to relatively low levels of credit risk
would receive the more favorable 50 percent risk weight. These criteria were also intended to ensure that such loans
have risk characteristics that are consistent with the Basle Accord's provisions regarding the assignment of a preferential
risk weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for securities collateralized by multifamily housing loans, the FDIC observed in the preamble to the proposed
rule that its risk-based capital guidelines presently accord a 50 percent risk weight to privately-issued mortgage-backed
securities that are ``backed by a pool of conventional mortgages,'' each of which meets the criteria ``for inclusion
in the 50 percent risk weight category at the time the pool is originated.'' Such securities must also meet a number
of safety and soundness criteria that are specified in the guidelines. Therefore, by operation of the existing language
on privately-issued mortgage-backed securities in the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines, the proposal stated
that the explicit addition of multifamily housing loans to the 50 percent risk weight category would have the effect
of lowering to 50 percent the risk weight for privately-issued mortgage-backed securities collateralized by such
loans, provided the multifamily housing loans that back these securities qualify for a 50 percent risk weight at the
time the securities are originated.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, in general, the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines currently assign a 20 percent risk weight to mortgage-backed
securities collateralized by multifamily housing loans that have been issued or guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored
agency. The final rule does not change the treatment of these mortgage-backed securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Loss Sharing Arrangements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC's existing risk-based capital guidelines do not specifically address how asset sales involving various
forms of loss sharing arrangements are to be handled by a selling bank. This is because, for purposes of applying the
risk-based capital standards, a bank's balance sheet assets are determined in accordance with the instructions
for the preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report). Thus, the instructions for
preparation of Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income are the source for guidance on determining the extent
to which assets such as multifamily housing loans are treated as sold when there is a loss sharing arrangement covering
the assets. The proposed rule therefore sought to implement the section 618(b) requirement that the FDIC's risk-based
capital guidelines take into account loss sharing arrangements on sales of multifamily housing loans by referencing
the relevant Call Report instructions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to sales subject to pro rata loss sharing arrangements, the Call Report instructions direct banks to
report these transactions in a manner that is consistent with the language of section 618(b)(2) quoted in section
I above. These instructions state that:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
If the risk retained by the seller is limited to some fixed percentage of any losses that might be incurred and there
are no other provisions resulting in retention of risk, either directly or indirectly, by the seller, the maximum
amount of possible loss for which the selling bank is at risk (the stated percentage times the sale proceeds) shall
be reported as a borrowing and the remaining amount of the assets transferred reported as a sale.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, the FDIC proposed to amend its risk-based capital guidelines to provide in a footnote an explanation of this
treatment for sellers of multifamily housing loans subject to pro rata loss sharing arrangements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For Call Report purposes, in general, other transfers of multifamily housing loans are to be reported as sales of the
transferred assets only if the selling institution ``(1) retains no risk of loss from the assets transferred resulting
from any cause and (2) has no obligation to any party for the payment of principal or interest on the assets transferred''
resulting from any cause. The FDIC's risk-based capital framework has taken other loss sharing arrangements into
account in this manner when determining the extent to which assets such as multifamily housing loans are treated as
sold and excluded from the balance sheet assets that must be risk weighted. In order to implement section 618(b)(3),
the FDIC proposed to amend its risk-based capital guidelines to explicitly disclose this treatment of other loss
sharing arrangements in a footnote.

III. Comment Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC received 21 comment letters addressing various aspects of its proposed rule. Letters were submitted by 12
depository institutions or holding companies, four trade associations representing depository institutions,
three trade associations representing housing and home building interests, and one secondary mortgage market maker.
One comment document was filed by a group of individuals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 21 letters received, six respondents agreed with the proposal to lower the risk weight for multifamily housing
loans and offered no suggestions for changes to it. Another 12 commenters generally found the FDIC's proposal acceptable,
but recommended certain changes in the eligibility criteria or the treatment of loss sharing arrangements. Three
respondents objected to the proposal to lower the risk weight for multifamily housing loans, although two of these
commenters made suggestions for improving the eligibility criteria. Three commenters, two of whom supported the
proposal and one who opposed it, expressed concern that Congress had mandated that the regulatory agencies lower
the risk weight for a specific loan category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Loan-to-Value Ratios 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the proposal called for the loan-to-value ratio requirement to be met at the origination of a multifamily
housing loan, the FDIC specifically requested comment on whether, in light of the other criteria that a multifamily
housing loan must also meet, (1) a loan that does not satisfy the loan-to-value ratio requirement at origination should
be permitted to do so later during the life of the loan and, if so, under what circumstances, and (2) a loan that satisfies
this requirement at origination but fails to do so at a later date should thereafter be ineligible for a 50 percent risk
weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These issues were addressed by five respondents. Two respondents suggested that the loan-to-value ratios of ``large''
multifamily properties be recalculated every two years to determine whether the required ratio continues to be met.
The other three respondents stated that multifamily housing loans not meeting the loan-to-value ratio requirement
at origination should be eligible for the 50 percent risk weight if the ratio later decreases as a result of either principal
payments or increased property values. However, only one of these three also recommended that multifamily housing
loans should have their risk weights increased from 50 to 100 percent if their loan-to-value ratios rise above the
levels set forth in the proposal subsequent to their origination. In contrast, another of these three commenters
stated that a multifamily housing loan whose loan-to-value ratio increases after origination should be eligible
to retain its 50 percent risk weight as long as the remaining eligibility criteria continued to be met. Finally, one
of these commenters expressed concern about the cost of obtaining appraisals if the final rule were to require frequent
reappraisals to ensure that the loan-to-value ratio requirement continues to be satisfied over time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering these comments and consulting with the other agencies, the FDIC has decided that the loan-to-value
ratio requirement in the final rule should not be a one-time only test at origination. Rather, a multifamily housing
loan that does not satisfy the loan-to-value ratio requirement at origination, but does so at a later date, should
then receive the benefit of a more favorable risk weight (assuming the other eligibility criteria are also met). A
multifamily housing loan whose loan-to-value ratio no longer meets the specified ratio requirement has a reduced
margin of collateral protection and its relative risk has increased to a level that no longer justifies the loan's
continued eligibility for a 50 percent risk weight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the final rule makes the loan-to-value ratio requirement an ongoing eligibility criterion by stating that
the ratio should be determined on the basis of the most current appraisal or evaluation of the property, whichever
may be appropriate.

 This approach is also intended to be consistent with the FDIC's regulations and guidelines for real estate lending
and appraisals. Under these regulations and guidelines, a bank's written real estate lending policies must establish
prudent underwriting standards, including loan-to-value limits. In addition, a bank's real estate appraisal and
evaluation programs should include general criteria that identify when it is in the bank's interests to reappraise
or reevaluate real estate collateral. Thus, the final rule does not mandate a specific frequency with which reappraisals
and reevaluations of multifamily properties must be made, but relies instead on a bank's own policies and procedures
in this area.

The specific loan-to-value ratios required by the proposed rule, i.e., 80 percent for fixed rate loans and 75 percent
for adjustable rate loans, were addressed by two commenters. Each suggested that the same ratio should apply regardless
of whether a loan has a fixed or adjustable rate. However, one of these commenters preferred using an 80 percent ratio
for all multifamily housing loans while the other preferred a 75 percent ratio. The final rule retains the separate
ratios for fixed and adjustable rate loans that were contained in the proposal. These ratios are taken directly from
the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, two commenters indicated that multifamily housing loans that do not meet the loan-to-value ratio requirement
but have additional collateral or credit enhancements such as mortgage insurance should be eligible for the 50 percent
risk weight. The FDIC's risk-based capital standards formally recognize only certain forms of collateral and guarantees
for purposes of risk-weighting assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items. The FDIC does not
believe it would be appropriate to recognize additional forms of collateral and guarantees solely for multifamily
housing loans.

Annual Occupancy Rate

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments were received from three respondents on the proposed requirement, not mandated by the statute, that the
average annual occupancy rate of the property securing the loan must have been at least 80 percent for at least one year.
These commenters pointed out that the ongoing loan-to-value ratio and debt service coverage ratio requirements
set forth in the statute should be sufficient to ensure that only high quality multifamily housing loans would qualify
for the 50 percent risk weight. It was also indicated that information on occupancy rates is not regularly being obtained
as part of the financial data that borrowers supply on the properties securing multifamily housing loans. Thus, the
inclusion of an occupancy rate requirement in the final rule would impose an additional burden on both borrowers and
lenders. The FDIC agrees with these commenters and has eliminated the proposed occupancy rate requirement from the
final rule.

Properties Owned by Cooperatives and Nonprofit Organizations

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters questioned the applicability of the eligibility criteria to properties owned by cooperative housing
corporations and nonprofit organizations. In particular, the ``operating income'' concept included in the debt
service coverage requirement was considered inappropriate because these types of properties, since they are not
owned by investors seeking a return on their investments, are not operated to produce income. Accordingly, these
commenters suggested that, for multifamily properties with a nonprofit form of ownership, a more flexible approach
to meeting the debt service coverage ratio requirements set forth in the statute would be justified. The FDIC recognizes
that the cash flow to service a loan secured by a multifamily property can come from ``operating income'' as well as
from other sources. Therefore, the debt service coverage criterion in the final rule indicates that properties owned
by cooperative housing corporations or nonprofit organizations must generate sufficient cash flow to provide protection
to the bank comparable to that afforded by the debt service coverage levels set forth in the statute that are based on
annual net operating income.

Two commenters stated that the FDIC's proposal to add a requirement that a multifamily housing loan must not be more
than 90 days past due or carried in nonaccrual status in order to qualify for the 50 percent risk weight was unnecessary
because of the statutory requirement that all principal and interest payments be made on a timely basis in accordance
with the terms of the loan for at least one year. One of these commenters indicated that a loan on which timely payments
have been made for at least one year ``will not be more than 90 days past due and is unlikely to be in nonaccrual status''
while the other suggested that the loan would be ``in reasonably good shape, even it is technically ninety (90) days
past due.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although it may not have been clear from the proposal, the requirement that a loan not be 90 days or more past due or in
nonaccrual status was intended to be an ongoing test that would have to be met at the time a multifamily housing loan
was placed in the 50 percent risk weight category and thereafter. The FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines currently
contain the same ongoing requirement for one-to-four family residential mortgages to qualify for the 50 percent
risk weight. In contrast, the statutory requirement that timely contractual principal and interest payments must
have occurred for at least one year before a multifamily housing loan can qualify for a 50 percent risk weight is a one-time
requirement. To eliminate confusion, the final rule separately lists these two eligibility criteria and clarifies
that timely payments must have been made for at least one year before a multifamily housing loan is placed in the 50 percent
risk weight category.

Prudent Underwriting Standards
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal's final eligibility criterion required the multifamily housing loan to have been made ``in accordance
with applicable lending limits and other prudent underwriting standards.'' Two commenters asked what was meant
by ``prudent underwriting standards.'' Guidance for prudent real estate loan underwriting standards is outlined
in appendix A to part 365 of the FDIC's rules and regulations, ``Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies''
(12 CFR part 365, appendix A), which was adopted by the FDIC in October 1992 (57 FR 62896, December 31, 1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third commenter suggested that this criterion was unnecessary and that it should go without saying that a bank should
comply with applicable lending limits. This commenter also questioned why lending limits were singled out in this
criterion when compliance with many other statutory and regulatory requirements is expected during the underwriting
of a loan. The FDIC has deleted the specific reference to lending limits in the final rule.

Optional Nature of Lower Risk Weight

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter who supported the proposal nonetheless requested that the FDIC ensure that banks are aware that, under
the final rule, they have the option of assigning multifamily housing loans that meet the criteria specified in the
rule to the 50 percent risk weight or continuing to treat such loans as 100 percent risk weight assets. One of the commenters
who opposed the proposal did so because the cost associated with substantiating that a multifamily housing loan was
eligible to be placed in the 50 percent risk weight category would exceed the benefit of the lower risk weight.

The FDIC has no intention of imposing this cost on banks that would prefer not to incur it. Thus, the FDIC wishes to reiterate
that, at each bank's option, assets, including multifamily housing loans, and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance
sheet items that are eligible to be assigned to a risk weight category lower than 100 percent may be included in a higher
risk weight category (e.g., the 100 percent risk weight category) than the category to which the assets or credit equivalent
amounts are otherwise eligible to be assigned.

Loss Sharing Arrangements

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comment letters from two respondents addressed the treatment of loss sharing arrangements in connection with the
sale of multifamily housing loans that was contained in the proposed rule. Both commenters agreed with the proposal's
approach for handling a pro rata loss sharing arrangement (i.e., for the selling bank to treat the transfer as a sale
to the extent that the purchaser shares with the seller on pro rata basis in any loss incurred), but took exception to
the proposed treatment of other loss sharing arrangements. Under the proposal, other loss sharing arrangements
were to be taken into account for purposes of determining the extent to which multifamily housing loans are treated
by the selling bank as sold (and excluded from balance sheet assets) under the risk-based capital framework in the
same manner as prescribed for reporting purposes in the Call Report instructions. Hence, multifamily housing loans
sold subject to loss sharing arrangements on other than a pro rata basis would treat such loans as sold for risk-based
capital purposes only if the selling bank retains no risk of loss from the loans transferred resulting from any cause
and has no obligation to any party for the payment of principal or interest on the loans transferred resulting from
any cause. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter indicated that, in lieu of the proposed treatment for other loss sharing arrangements, the selling
institution ``should retain capital in proportion to the risk retained but not for the whole loan.'' The other commenter
who addressed loss sharing arrangements stated that the proposed treatment of other loss sharing arrangements does
not ``provide an accurate measure of risk exposure or appropriately tailored incentives,'' ``may discourage lenders
from limiting their recourse obligation,'' and is ``inconsistent with the statutory requirement.'' This commenter
recommended that the FDIC ``adopt rules that distinguish different loss risks for non-pro rata arrangements, rather
than the existing rule in the Call Reports'' and offered suggested approaches for doing so. This commenter also acknowledged
that the regulatory capital treatment of asset sales subject to loss sharing arrangements is an issue that goes beyond
multifamily housing loans and requires a comprehensive solution.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC recognizes that the proposed rule on other loss sharing arrangements essentially treats all such arrangements
in an identical manner regardless of the terms of the arrangement and, as a consequence, may not encourage banks that
sell multifamily housing loans with recourse to limit their exposure to risk. However, these concerns extend to asset
sales with recourse in general because of the broad scope of the Call Report instructions in this area and their relationship
to the risk-based capital framework. The FDIC and the other banking agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial
Institutions Examination Council, have been pursuing a more comprehensive resolution of the capital issues surrounding
asset sales with recourse and other forms of credit enhancement. This interagency effort is seeking to develop revisions
to the agencies' risk-based capital standards that will better distinguish between the degrees of risk in loss sharing
arrangements involving asset sales in general, not just those involving multifamily housing loans. The FDIC expects
that these revisions would be more likely to fully satisfy the intent of section 618(b)(3) with respect to other loss
sharing arrangements than the approach taken in the proposed rule. Nevertheless, the FDIC does not wish to further
delay the issuance of a final rule that lowers the risk weight for certain multifamily housing loans and provides guidance
on the risk-based capital treatment of pro rata loss sharing arrangements while the interagency effort to address
recourse issues is proceeding. Therefore, as an interim measure, the FDIC is adopting the treatment of other loss
sharing arrangements as originally proposed.

Several commenters suggested changes to the proposed rule that would conflict with the requirements set forth in

have not been adopted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After considering the comments received and consulting with the other agencies, the FDIC is adopting a final rule
to implement section 618(b) of the RTCRRIA. The final rule will also satisfy that portion of section 305 of the FDICIA
relating to the application of the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines to multifamily housing loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule adds a new paragraph on multifamily housing loans to the discussion of the types of assets accorded a
50 percent risk weight in the section of the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines on risk weights for balance sheet
assets (section II.C.). The new paragraph enumerates the criteria that a multifamily housing loan must satisfy in
order to be eligible for this favorable risk weight. A conforming change has been made to the summary of risk weights
and risk categories in table II of the guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The eligibility criteria contained in the final rule include those set forth in section 618(b) and two added by the
FDIC based on the authority granted in the statute. These criteria are that the loan must be secured by a first lien on
a multifamily residential property, the loan-to-value ratio for the property must not exceed 80 percent (75 percent
if the rate of interest on the loan changes over the term of the loan), the ratio of annual net operating income generated
by the property (before debt service) to annual debt service on the loan must not be less than 120 percent (115 percent
if the rate of interest on the loan changes over the term of the loan), the amortization period for principal and interest
on the loan must not exceed 30 years, the loan must have a minimum original maturity for principal repayment of not less
than seven years, the loan must have had timely payment of principal and interest in accordance with the loan terms
for at least one year before the loan is placed in the 50 percent risk weight category, the loan must not be 90 days or more
past due or carried in nonaccrual status, and the loan must have been made in accordance with prudent underwriting
standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of satisfying the one year's timely repayment performance criterion in the case where the existing owner
of a multifamily residential property refinances a loan on that property, the final rule provides that all principal
and interest payments on the loan being refinanced must have been made on a timely basis in accordance with the terms
of the loan for at least the preceding year. In this situation, all of the other eligibility criteria must also be met
in order for the new loan to qualify for the 50 percent risk weight. For example, the annual debt service required on
the new loan would be used when determining whether the debt service coverage requirement has been satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the final rule, the loan-to-value ratio requirement must be met based on the most current appraisal or evaluation
of the property, whichever may be appropriate, and, at the origination of loans to purchase an existing property,
the term ``value'' means the lesser of the actual acquisition cost or the estimate of value for the property. In addition,
the final rule explains that, to satisfy the debt service coverage requirement, a property owned by a cooperative
housing corporation or nonprofit organization must generate sufficient cash flow to provide protection to the bank
comparable to that specified in the statute.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule also revises the existing paragraph addressing privately-issued mortgage-backed securities in
the discussion of the types of assets assigned to the 50 percent risk weight category. The amendment clarifies that
in order for a security backed by a pool of conventional mortgages on multifamily residential properties to be accorded
a 50 percent risk weight, each underlying mortgage must meet the eligibility criteria described above at the time
the pool is originated. A bank that purchases such a security will not be required to monitor the eligibility of each
underlying mortgage on an ongoing basis to ensure that a 50 percent risk weight remains appropriate for the security.
Instead, the security may remain in the 50 percent risk weight category as long as principal or interest payments on
the security are not 30 days or more past due. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the final rule amends the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines by stating in a footnote that a multifamily
housing loan that is sold subject to a pro rata loss sharing arrangement is to be treated by the selling bank as sold (and
excluded from balance sheet assets) to the extent that the sales agreement provides for the purchaser of the loan to
share in any loss incurred on the loan on a pro rata basis with the selling bank. This means that, in such a transaction,
the portion of the loan that is treated as sold by the selling bank is not subject to the risk-based capital standards.
This footnote also provides explicit guidance on the risk-based capital treatment of sales of multifamily housing
loans in which the purchaser of a loan shares in any loss incurred on the loan with the selling institution on other than
a pro rata basis. It states that these other loss sharing arrangements are taken into account for purposes of determining
the extent to which such loans are treated by the selling bank as sold (and excluded from balance sheet assets) under
the risk-based capital framework in the same manner as prescribed for reporting purposes in the instructions for
preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The instructions applicable to such transactions are contained in the Glossary entry for ``sales of assets.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This final rule is effective January 27, 1994. The FDIC has determined that good cause exists to waive the customary
30-day delayed effective date since the rule relieves a restriction on insured state nonmember banks by permitting
them to utilize a lower risk weight for eligible multifamily housing loans and securities collateralized by such
loans in calculations of their risk-based capital ratios. In addition, insured state nonmember banks may choose
to utilize this lower risk weight in their Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for December 31, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FDIC certifies that the adoption of this amendment to its risk-based capital guidelines will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small business entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment will benefit insured state nonmember banks by reducing the minimum amount of capital that they are required
to maintain for certain multifamily housing loans and securities collateralized by such loans. The proposal would
apply equally to all insured state nonmember banks, regardless of size, and should not disproportionately affect
a substantial number of small banks.

The types of loans that qualify as loans secured by multifamily residential properties are listed in the instructions
for preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income. In addition, as provided in those instructions,
a multifamily residential property loan that is sold subject to a pro rata loss sharing arrangement is treated by the
selling bank as sold (and excluded from balance sheet assets) to the extent that the sales agreement provides for the
purchaser of the loan to share in any loss incurred on the loan on a pro rata basis with the selling bank. In such a transaction,
from the standpoint of the selling bank, the portion of the loan that is treated as sold is not subject to the risk-based
capital standards. In connection with sales of multifamily residential property loans in which the purchaser of
a loan shares in any loss incurred on the loan with the selling institution on other than a pro rata basis, these other
loss sharing arrangements are taken into account for purposes of determining the extent to which such loans are treated
by the selling bank as sold (and excluded from balance sheet assets) under the risk-based capital framework in the
same manner as prescribed for reporting purposes in the instructions for preparation of the Consolidated Reports
of Condition and Income.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), by the Farm Credit Administration Board (Board), adopts a final rule amending
its regulations to allow Farm Credit System (FCS) institutions to document the existence of a first lien on the security
for long-term real estate mortgage loans by obtaining title insurance or an attorney's certification. The current
regulation requires that an attorney's certification be obtained for every long-term mortgage loan in order for
that loan to qualify as collateral for FCS debt obligations. The regulation is being amended because title insurance
has become the prevailing method used by the mortgage lending industry to ensure clear title. Additionally, the revised
regulation permits FCS institutions greater flexibility in determining which method for validating first lien
position (an attorney's certification or title insurance) provides the institution the most cost-effective and
efficient protection.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1.10(a)(2) of the Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended (Act), requires that long-term mortgage loans made by
Farm Credit Banks (FCBs) under section 1.7 of the Act, or by associations under sections 1.7 and 7.6 of the Act, ``be
secured by first liens on interests in real estate of such classes as may be prescribed by regulations of the Farm Credit
Administration.'' At present, &sect;615.5060 requires that an attorney's certification be obtained for long-term
mortgage loans if such loans are to qualify as collateral for FCS debt obligations. However, title insurance is the
prevailing method for ensuring clear title in the mortgage lending industry and is becoming more commonplace in FCS
lending. Title insurance can provide a lender with protection that is comparable to an attorney's certification
and in some instances may be more timely and less expensive to obtain. Under the present &sect;615.5060, even if FCS
lenders obtain title insurance they must also obtain an attorney's certification, thus incurring unnecessary expense
without providing any substantial additional protection. FCA reconsidered this requirement, and published a proposed
rule on October 12, 1993 (58 FR 52701) to amend the regulation to permit institutions to obtain title insurance instead
of an attorney's certificate to document the existence of a first lien, provided that the title insurance policy meets
certain standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA recognizes that practices within the mortgage lending industry continually change and is amending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;615.5060 to give FCS institutions additional flexibility while maintaining protection for them as well as
for FCS investors and borrower-stockholders. The revised regulation allows FCS institutions to determine which
method for validating first lien position (an attorney's certification or title insurance) provides them the best
protection for the amount expended.

II. Synopsis of Comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment period for the proposed amendments to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;615.5060 closed November 12, 1993. FCA received four comment letters during the public comment period from:
The Farm Credit Council (FCC), a Farm Credit Bank (FCB), an agricultural credit association (ACA), and a Texas law
firm. In addition, an FCB and a Federal land credit association (FLCA) commented on this regulation as part of their
responses to the FCA Board's Statement on Regulatory Burden, which appeared in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 23, 1993 (58 FR 34003), seeking public comment on the appropriateness of regulatory requirements imposed
on the FCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All commenters strongly supported the amendments to the proposed regulation. In general, commenters believe that
the revision would provide additional flexibility and allow FCS institutions to evaluate present practices and
determine the best course of action. Further, commenters indicated that since many FCS institutions already require
title insurance on real estate loans the proposed regulation would greatly simplify the closing process and reduce
costs. One commenter stated that the FCA's existing requirement for long-term real estate loans is both antiquated
and unduly burdensome, and it therefore fully endorsed the intent of FCA's proposed regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to general comments, the FCC and the ACA offered technical suggestions that they believe would improve
or clarify the regulation. Commenters were concerned that the words ``at loan closing'' in proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;615.5060(a)(2) created some ambiguity because it is often not possible to obtain a title insurance policy
at the time of loan closing. One commenter stated that a loan is closed based on a title commitment and a final title insurance
policy is not issued until after loan closing when there is satisfaction of the requirements set out in the commitment.
Another commenter stated that it is a common practice to obtain the actual title policy at a later date, with the policy
being issued ``as of'' the date the lien documents are recorded. Commenters asserted that FCS institutions would
be unable to take advantage of the additional flexibility and cost savings the proposed regulation is intended to
provide if the institutions were required to obtain a final title insurance policy at loan closing. FCA modified proposed
&sect;615.5060(a)(2) by deleting the requirement that the policy be obtained ``at loan closing'' but notes that
the Act authorizes an FCB to make a long-term mortgage loan only if that loan is secured by a first lien on real estate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCC and the ACA also commented that, as currently written, proposed &sect;615.5060(a)(2)(ii) might be construed
to mean that counsel must approve not only the standard form to be used, but also the way in which the form is completed
in each particular case. Paragraph (a)(2)(ii) requires only that the final title policy be issued on a standard title
insurance policy form that the counsel for the lending institution has approved. The language in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)
was revised to make this clearer. Further, the FCC and the ACA suggested that, because many ACAs and FLCAs do not have
their own in-house counsel, the regulation should be modified to allow counsel for either the association or the ``supervising''
bank to approve the standard form. The phrase ``counsel for the lending institution'' in &sect;615.5060 (a)(2)(ii)
and (a)(2)(iv) is not meant to require that an association have in-house counsel. An association may, if it wishes,
rely on counsel for the affiliated bank or the association's retained counsel if counsel agrees to act for the association
in approving the form of the title insurance policy and prescribing these standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;615.5060(a)(2)(iii) requires that the title insurance policy be issued ``for an amount equal to
the balance outstanding on the real estate mortgage loan.'' Commenters stated that multiple tracts of real estate
are frequently offered as security for a loan and in some situations separate title insurance policies for various
tracts are obtained from different insurers. The FCC further stated that title insurance companies often require
that the insured amount be allocated among the various policies, and often refuse to issue a policy in an amount in excess
of the value of the particular tract they are insuring. The FCC further stated that the amount of the title insurance
that should be required should be directly related to the value of the lender's interest in the property that is being
insured. Therefore, the FCC suggested that &sect;615.5060(a)(2)(iii) be revised to require that the final policy
be issued for an amount equal to the balance outstanding on the real estate mortgage loan ``or such lesser amount as
is sufficient to protect the interest of the lending institution in the insured property.'' The FCC believes that
such language would enable the lending institution to determine whether the title policy should be issued for the
full amount of the loan or, when multiple tracts are taken as security, for the market or appraised value of the property
being insured, whether that value is greater than or less than the amount of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA Board conceptually agrees with the commenters that the title insurance should be issued for an amount that
is sufficient to protect the interest of the lending institution. However, the FCA Board believes that the amount
of title insurance necessary to protect the lender on a long-term real estate mortgage loan is no less than the outstanding
loan balance. The Act and FCA regulations limit long-term real estate loans to a percentage of the appraised value
of the real estate security. FCA's regulation does not require that an institution obtain title insurance for an amount
that is in excess of the value of the real estate security, but rather requires coverage in an amount at least equal to
the outstanding loan balance, an amount less than the value of the real estate security. In the case of multiple tracts,
if a separate policy is issued for a tract, the minimum amount insured by that policy shall bear the same ratio to the
outstanding balance that the appraised value of the tract bears to the appraised value of all the real estate security.
Accordingly, the final rule requires that if only title insurance is used to document the existence of a first lien,
the final title policy or policies must be issued for an amount at least equal to the outstanding loan balance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters also indicated that in loans with multiple tracts, title to some tracts may be evidenced by abstracts while
other tracts are covered by title insurance. This comment indirectly raises the issue of whether the regulation permits
the lender to decide, for each tract, whether to use an attorney lien certification or title insurance to document
the existence of a first lien when more than one tract is involved in a single first mortgage loan. The regulation should
not be read to preclude the use of different methods of lien documentation for different tracts. In the case of multiple
tracts, if title insurance is relied upon for some tracts and attorney certifications are used for others, the minimum
amount insured by a policy for a particular tract shall bear the same ratio to the outstanding balance that the appraised
value of the tract bears to the appraised value of all the real estate security. For example, suppose a loan for $80,000
is secured by two properties with appraised values of $70,000 and $30,000. Insurance policies for the properties
should be obtained in amounts of at least $56,000 and $24,000, respectively. If an attorney lien certification is
used for the first property, then title insurance for the second property need only be obtained for $24,000_not the
$80,000 loan amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed paragraph (a)(2)(iv) requires that personnel with adequate training and experience in real estate title
matters, designated by counsel, certify in writing that they reviewed the final policy and that the final policy insures
a first lien or its equivalent on the primary real estate security for the loan. Commenters believe that it should suffice
that a person performing this function meet certain standards of training and experience that are prescribed by the
counsel for the lender, but that there should be no specific requirement that counsel actually designate the individual
who performs this function. The FCA agrees with the commenters' observations and has modified paragraph (a)(2)(iv)
to require that a person performing this function meet written standards for training and experience prescribed
by the counsel for the lender, and to eliminate any implication that counsel actually has to designate the individual
who performs this function.

Finally, the first sentence of &sect;615.5060(a) is revised to make it less awkward. The meaning of the sentence is

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Wytwornia Sprzetu Komunikacyjnego
``PZL&hyph;RZESZOW'' PZL&hyph;3S Second Series engines, that currently requires removal from service of certain
modified pistons, inspection of the propeller to engine propeller-flange attachment bolts, inspection of the engine
propeller-flange retaining nut, and inspection of the rear crankshaft counterweight system. This amendment removes
the repetitive inspection requirements of the existing AD, but retains the requirement to remove from service certain
modified pistons. This amendment is prompted by test results that have indicated that PZL&hyph;3S Second Series
engines not configured with modified pistons are not susceptible to excessive vibration. The actions specified
by this AD are intended to prevent separation of the propeller and loss of the aircraft.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations by superseding AD 91&hyph;18&hyph;12, Amendment
39&hyph;8120 (57 FR 5378, February 14, 1992), which is applicable to Wytwornia Sprzetu Komunikacyjnego ``PZL&hyph;RZESZOW''
PZL&hyph;3S Second Series engines, was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 5, 1993 (58 FR 278). That action proposed to remove the repetitive inspection requirements of the existing
AD, but retain the requirements for removal from service of certain pistons that have been modified and assembled
with certain compression ring, scraper ring, and oil control ring components. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were received on the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 11 PZL&hyph;3S Second Series engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA
estimates that 3 engines of the affected design are installed on aircraft of U.S. registry, that it will take approximately
5 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $825. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under
the caption

History

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On August 25, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish
Class E airspace at Adel, Georgia, to accommodate a VOR/DME&hyph;A instrument approach procedure to the Cook County
Airport, Adel, Georgia (58 FR 47411). The proposal was to add controlled airspace extending upward from 700 feet above
the surface to contain IFR operations in controlled airspace during portions of the terminal operation and while
transiting between the en route and terminal environments, and to change the operating status of the airport from
visual flight rules (VFR) operations to include IFR operations concurrent with publication of the SIAP. Interested
parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal
to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition
area'' and has replaced it with the designation ``Class E airspace'' for airspace extending upward from 700 feet above
the surface. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Designation for Class
E airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA
Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1
(58 FR 36298, July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently
in the Order.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations establishes Class E airspace at Adel, Georgia, to accommodate
a VOR/DME&hyph;A SIAP based on the Moultrie VOR to the Cook County Airport. Controlled airspace extending upward
from 700 feet above the surface is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in
order to comply with applicable VFR requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the operating status of the Cook County Airport is changed from VFR operations to include IFR operations
concurrent with the publication of the SIAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and
air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of changes occurring in the National
Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities, addition of new obstacles, or changes
in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and efficient use of the navigable airspace
and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the affected airports.

This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description on each SIAP is contained
in the appropriate FAA Form 8260 and the National Flight Data Center (FDC)/Permanent (P) Notices to Airmen (NOTAM)
which are incorporated by reference in the amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part 51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR). Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination or purchase as stated
above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction of charts printed by publishers or aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The Provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.

The Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
SIAPs. For safety and timeliness of change considerations, this amendment incorporates only specific changes contained
in the content of the following FDC/P NOTAM for each SIAP. The SIAP information in some previously designated FDC/Temporary
(FDC/T) NOTAMs is of such duration as to be permanent. With conversion to FDC/P NOTAMs, the respective FDC/T NOTAMs
have been cancelled. The FDC/P NOTAMs for the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained
in the U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these chart changes to SIAPs
by FDC/P NOTAMs, the TERPs criteria were applied to only these specific conditions existing at the affected airports.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 contains separate SIAPs which have compliance dates stated as effective dates based on related
changes in the National Airspace System or the application of new or revised criteria. All SIAP amendments in this
rule have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice Airmen (NOTAM) as an emergency
action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances which
created the need for all these SIAP amendments requires making them effective in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the US Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). Because of the close and immediate relationship between these SIAPs and
safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary, impracticable,
and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making these SIAPs effective
in less than 30 days.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the
anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) for
operations at certain airports. These regulatory actions are needed because of the adoption of new or revised criteria,
or because of changes occurring in the National Airspace System, such as the commissioning of new navigational facilities,
addition of new obstacles, or changes in air traffic requirements. These changes are designed to provide safe and
efficient use of the navigable airspace and to promote safe flight operations under instrument flight rules at the
affected airports.

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment to part 97 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 97) establishes, amends, suspends, or revokes
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs). The complete regulatory description of each SIAP is contained
in official FAA form documents which are incorporated by reference in this amendment under 5 U.S.C. 552(a), 1 CFR part
51, and &sect;97.20 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR). The applicable FAA Forms are identified as FAA Forms
8260&hyph;3, 8260&hyph;4, and 8260&hyph;5. Materials incorporated by reference are available for examination
or purchase as stated above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The large number of SIAPs, their complex nature, and the need for a special format make their verbatim publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 expensive and impractical. Further, airmen do not use the regulatory text of the SIAPs, but refer to their graphic
depiction on charts printed by publishers of aeronautical materials. Thus, the advantages of incorporation by reference
are realized and publication of the complete description of each SIAP contained in FAA form documents is unnecessary.
The provisions of this amendment state the affected CFR (and FAR) sections, with the types and effective dates of the
SIAPs. This amendment also identifies the airport, its location, the procedure identification and the amendment
number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This amendment to part 97 is effective upon publication of each separate SIAP as contained in the transmittal. Some
SIAP amendments may have been previously issued by the FAA in a National Flight Data Center (FDC) Notice to Airmen (NOTAM)
as an emergency action of immediate flight safety relating directly to published aeronautical charts. The circumstances
which created the need for some SIAP amendments may require making them effective in less than 30 days. For the remaining
SIAPs, an effective date at least 30 days after publication is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the SIAPs contained in this amendment are based on the criteria contained in the U.S. Standard for Terminal
Instrument Approach Procedures (TERPs). In developing these SIAPs, the TERPS criteria were applied to the conditions
existing or anticipated at the affected airports. Because of the close and immediate relationship between these
SIAPs and safety in air commerce, I find that notice and public procedure before adopting these SIAPs are unnecessary,
impracticable, and contrary to the public interest and, where applicable, that good cause exists for making some
SIAPs effective in less than 30 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which
frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant
regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies
and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as
the anticipated impact is so minimal. For the same reason, the FAA certifies that this amendment will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 North Carolina has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). North Carolina's revisions consist of the provisions contained in rules promulgated
between July 1, 1990, and June 30, 1991, otherwise known as RCRA Cluster I. These requirements are listed in Section
B of this document. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed North Carolina's application(s) and
has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that the North Carolina hazardous waste program revisions
satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve North
Carolina's hazardous waste program revisions. North Carolina's applications for program revisions are available
for public review and comment.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or
``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent
to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure,
the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows
States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated
under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements
under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority
is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes
to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268, and 270.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
North Carolina initially received final authorization for its base RCRA program effective on December 31, 1984,
(49 FR 48694). North Carolina most recently received final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization effective February 16, 1993, for Non-HSWA Cluster VI and HSWA Cluster II (54 FR 59825, December 16,
1992). On September 21, 1992, North Carolina submitted program revision application for additional program approvals.
On October 20, 1993, North Carolina submitted an addendium to the September 21, 1992, program revision application.
Today, North Carolina is seeking approval of its program revisions in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has reviewed North Carolina's applications and has made an immediate final decision that North Carolina's hazardous
waste program revisions satisfy all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently,
EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to North Carolina. The public
may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until February 28, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Approval of North Carolina's program revisions shall become effective March 28, 1994, unless an adverse comment
pertaining to the State's revisions discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a
notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses
the decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA shall administer any RCRA hazardous waste permits, or portions of permits that contain conditions based upon
the Federal program provisions for which the State is applying for authorization and which were issued by EPA prior
to the effective date of this authorization. EPA will suspend issuance of any further permits under the provisions
for which the State is being authorized on the effective date of this authorization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
North Carolina is today seeking authority to administer the following federal requirements promulgated between
July 1, 1990, and June 30, 1991, for the requirements of RCRA Cluster I except for the February 21, 1991, (56 FR 7134)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
I conclude that North Carolina's application(s) for these program revisions meet all of the statutory and regulatory
requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, North Carolina is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous
waste program as revised.

North Carolina now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders
and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program, subject to the limitations of its program revision application
and previously approved authorities. North Carolina also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although
EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under sections
3008, 3013, and 7003 of RCRA.

Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability
of certain Federal regulations in favor of North Carolina's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements
for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This order clarifies that the Commission rather than COLE managers will grant examination credit when appropriate
and that applicants who desire examination credit must submit documentation supporting their request. This action
was needed to clarify the rules. It will eliminate procedures that are unnecessary and duplicative of functions performed
by the Commission license processing staff.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Section 13.205 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 13.205, currently provides that a commercial operator license
examination (COLE) manager must give examination credit to an examinee holding certain documents.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 This procedure is unnecessary and duplicative of a function performed by the Commission license processing staff.
We are amending &sect;13.205, therefore, to clarify that the Commission rather than the COLE manager will grant examination
credit when appropriate, and &sect;&sect;13.9(c) and 13.13(c) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 13.9(c) and 13.13(c),
to clarify that applicants who desire examination credit must submit documentation supporting their request.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
These documents are an unexpired (or within the grace period) FCC-issued commercial radio operator license, an FCC-issued
Amateur Extra Class operator license, and a Proof of Passing Certificate issued within the past 365 days. The purpose
of granting examination element credit is to recognize that an examinee previously has passed an examination that
covers the same material and, therefore, does not need to demonstrate again his or her knowledge of this material.

2. We also are moving the showing required of an applicant to qualify for a radiotelegraph Six Months Service Endorsement
from &sect;13.201(c) of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 13.201(c), to &sect;13.9(d) of the Commission's Rules, 47
CFR 13.9(d). This change is intended to clarify that qualification for the Six Month Service Endorsement is determined
directly by the Commission rather than the COLE Manager.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule amends and extends Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 36, which provides that authorized
repair station and aircraft operating certificate holders may approve aircraft products or articles for return
to service after accomplishing major repairs using self-developed repair data that have not been approved by the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Amendments include clarification of the scope of the SFAR authorization.
Extension of the regulation continues to provide, for those that qualify, an alternative from the requirement to
obtain FAA approval of major repair data on a case-by-case basis, and allows additional time for the FAA to incorporate
the SFAR provisions into the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on Thursday, October 21, 1993; the comment period closed on November 22, 1993. Ten comments were received and are addressed
below in the section entitled Discussion of Comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, the FAA proposed amending and extending the termination date of Special Federal Aviation Regulation
(SFAR) No. 36, which allows authorized certificate holders (domestic repair stations, air carriers, air taxi operators
of large aircraft, and commercial operators of large aircraft) to approve aircraft products and articles for return
to service after accomplishing major repairs using data developed by the holder that have not been approved by the
FAA. Currently, more than 40 air carrier and domestic repair station certificate holders currently have SFAR 36 authorizations
that will terminate on January 23, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the SFAR was initially adopted in 1978, some of the regulatory language has received differing field interpretation.
As a result, some repaired products have been returned to service by SFAR 36 authorization holders that did not have
return to service authority. These interpretations are the result of changes in the repair industry since the initial
adoption of the rule. The original SFAR 36 did not foresee that some repair stations would be authorized only to perform
maintenance on parts or components of articles without authorization to return them to service. These interpretations
of eligibility have allowed several SFAR 36 authorizations to be issued and used inconsistently with the original
intent of the SFAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An aircraft ``product'' is an aircraft, airframe, aircraft engine, propeller, or appliance. An aircraft ``article''
is an airframe, powerplant, propeller, instrument, radio, or accessory. Although some repair stations are authorized
only to perform maintenance on parts of articles or products, some SFAR 36 authorizations were used by these repair
station certificate holders to approve the articles and products for return to service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has found that while repair stations that specialize in the repair of parts or components of aircraft articles
or products may have the technical capability and scope sufficient for the individual repair, they do not necessarily
possess the overall knowledge necessary for returning an article or product to service. Only repair stations and
air carriers that understand the form, fit, and function of an aircraft article or product should be authorized to
approve that article or product for return to service after a major repair. Furthermore, one must understand the form,
fit, and function of the article or product in order to fully evaluate the ramifications of a major repair being developed
for that article or product. When the FAA finds that a repair station or air carrier has that necessary understanding,
the FAA issues it a certificate and operations specifications commensurate with that finding, and the repair station
or air carrier is granted return to service authority. This higher level of certitude by the FAA in the work and knowledge
of the repair station or carrier that is authorized to approve the rated article or product for return to service is
the basis for the SFAR 36 authorization to develop and use data for major repairs without FAA approval of the data. The
preamble to the original SFAR 36 reflected this intent to limit the authorization to these repair stations and carriers
when it discussed the need to have damaged aircraft repaired and returned to service as quickly as possible. The SFAR
36 system was never intended to support repairs accomplished further up in the repair stream.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
History
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the adoption of SFAR 36, certificate holders that were qualified to make repairs were required to obtain FAA
approval on a case-by-case basis for data they had developed to perform major repairs. The only alternative to the
time-consuming, case-by-case approval method was to petition for and obtain an exemption granting relief from the
regulation. The number of exemptions being granted indicated that revisions to the Federal Aviation Regulations
(FAR) were necessary, and SFAR 36 was adopted on January 23, 1978, as an interim rulemaking action. Adoption of the
SFAR eliminated the requirement for authorized certificate holders to petition for exemption from the regulation,
and allowed the FAA additional time to obtain the information necessary to develop a permanent rule change. Most of
the affected certificate holders, however, did not use the provisions of SFAR 36 until it was well into its second year
and nearing its expiration date of January 23, 1980. Since the FAA did not yet have sufficient data upon which to base
a permanent rule change, the termination data for SFAR 36 was extended to January 23, 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the FAA has considered consolidating certain authorizations along with those issued under SFAR 36 to make
them permanent parts of the regulations, no rulemaking action has been undertaken, and SFAR 36 has been extended three
times. Currently, permanent regulatory action is under consideration by the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee
(ARAC).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA defines aircraft ``product,'' ``article,'' and ``component'' for the purpose of the SFAR. The definitions
explain more clearly an authorization holder's return to service authority.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA restates the general provisions of the current SFAR in terms applicable to the individual types of eligible
certificate holders. Paragraph (c) of section 2 clarifies that an SFAR 36 authorization does not expand the scope
of authority of a repair station certificate holder; i.e., it does not give a repair station return to service authority
for any article for which it is not rated or change the articles it is rated to repair.

Section 3 states that an authorized certificate holder may approve an aircraft product or article for return to service
after accomplishing a major repair, using data not approved by the Administrator, only in accordance with the amended
SFAR. Section 3 requires that the data used to perform the major repair be developed and ``approved'' in accordance
with the holder's authorization and procedures manual. Section 3 also enables an authorization holder to use its
developed repair data on a subsequent repair of the same type of product or article. For each subsequent repair, the
holder must determine that accomplishment of the repair, using previously developed data, will return the product
or article to its original or properly altered condition and will conform to all applicable airworthiness requirements.
In addition, each subsequent use of the data would have to be recorded in the authorization holder's SFAR records.

Section 5 identifies the requirements a certificate holder must meet to be eligible for an SFAR 36 authorization.
Paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), and (b) define the personnel required and incorporate clarifying changes from the current

Section 7
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7 states that SFAR 36 terminates on January 23, 1999. All authorizations issued under this SFAR will terminate
on that date unless earlier surrendered, suspended, revoked, or otherwise terminated. Section 7 also allows previous
authorization holders to either surrender their SFAR 36-developed data to the FAA or to maintain the data indefinitely
and make it available to the FAA for inspection.

Section 9 contains the inspection provisions of the current SFAR. It also emphasizes that the FAA must be able to determine
whether an applicant has, or a holder maintains, personnel adequate to comply with the provisions of the SFAR and any
additional limitations contained in the authorization.

Section 10 re-emphasizes that an SFAR 36 authorization does not expand the scope of products or articles that an aircraft
operator or repair station is authorized to approve for return to service. This section also emphasizes that the authorization
allows a holder to approve for return to service a product or article after major repair performed by the holder using
data developed by the holder without FAA approval of that data.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 12 and 13 address data review and service experience requirements and record keeping requirements. Section
12 states the circumstances in which a holder will be required to submit the information necessary for corrective
action on a repair. Paragraph (b) of section 13 lists the identification information required rather than use the
term ``FAA identification,'' which has been the source of confusion in previous versions of the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the termination date for SFAR 36 is January 23, 1999. The 5-year extension was chosen to allow enough
time for the ARAC to deliberate and forward a recommendation, and enough time for the FAA to deliberate and act upon
it. On or about the effective date of this final rule, each FAA office having jurisdiction over a current SFAR 36 authorization
will reevaluate each holder in terms of the amended rule. All current holders will be notified in writing as to whether
they continue to qualify under the amended rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA will work with those holders that no longer qualify to establish, where possible, means to perform approved
major repairs. The means may include submitting repair data to an aircraft certification office (ACO) for approval,
utilizing a consultant designated engineering representative (DER) to approve the data, or employing a company
DER.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The extension of SFAR 36 will allow uninterrupted major repair activity by the current authorization holders that
qualify under the amended SFAR; those authorizations will be extended without the holders reapplying for authorization.
The extension will also allow a new, qualified applicant to obtain an authorization instead of petitioning for exemption
from the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons were afforded the opportunity to participate in development of this rulemaking by submitting
written comments to the public regulatory docket on or before November 22, 1993. All comments received have been reviewed
and duly considered in promulgating this final rule; comments received after November 22, 1993, have been considered
to the extent possible without delaying this rulemaking action. Ten comments were received; two from foreign aviation
industry companies, three from domestic aviation industry companies, and five from domestic aviation industry
associations. One of the foreign commenters only requests a copy of the NPRM and does not offer substantive comments.
Of the remaining nine comments, one opposes the NPRM and four support it. The other four commenters do not declare agreement
or opposition to the NPRM, but submit comments and suggestions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters state that a repair station that has the authority to return to service a product or article should
be able to develop and use major repair data for components or parts of those products and articles and return them to
service as well. One of these commenters suggested that the FAA meant to imply that air carriers and repair stations
that accomplish major repairs on products or articles are not qualified to accomplish major repairs on parts or components
of those products or articles. The FAA agrees that repair stations with the authority to return to service a product
or article are qualified and must be able to develop and use major repair data to perform repairs on components or parts
of those products or articles. The FAA disagrees, however, that the repair station should automatically be permitted
to return to service those components or parts, unless the components or parts are reinserted into the original product
or article before leaving the repair station. This SFAR addresses the development of major repair data; the issues
concerning accomplishing the repair and return to service authority for repair stations for components or parts
is beyond the scope of this rulemaking, and no changes are made to the NPRM pursuant to these comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters suggest that the final rule should allow current holders of the SFAR 36 authorization to continue to
use the authorization for the term of the extension, or until a permanent rule is in place. One of these commenters read
the NPRM to mean that repair stations currently conducting work under SFAR 36 must discontinue such work. The FAA disagrees;
the rule does not require that work be discontinued, but rather that the repair station performing the work be truly
qualified before returning an article to service. As was stated in the NPRM, some SFAR 36 authorizations were issued
in error, due to misinterpretations of the rule. The FAA has determined that the error must not continue and those authorizations
issued in error can not be extended without the authorization holders meeting all qualifications. The rule language
proposed in the NPRM is retained to clarify the qualifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter is concerned that its current authorization may lapse on the termination date of January 23, 1994. To
ensure a smooth transition, current SFAR 36 authorization holders will be permitted to use their authorizations
until the FAA notifies them that they do not continue to qualify to hold the authorization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter proposes that the rule include a system of positive identification on the restored product with traceability
directly back to the facility performing the major repair and to the specific data package authorizing the major repair.
The FAA agrees that this issue has merit; however, such a requirement would add a substantial burden not proposed in
the NPRM. The suggestion is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Future documents such as Advisory Circulars, FAA
Orders, or other rulemaking projects, including those developed in the ARAC, may consider this suggestion, if applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggests allowing foreign repair stations to use SFAR 36 authorizations to develop and use major repair
data. The FAA disagrees; SFAR 36 has never been available to foreign repair stations. The resources and database systems
currently available to oversee foreign operations are not sufficient to adequately monitor such SFAR 36 authorizations.
The rule will not be expanded to include foreign repair stations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggests that the current SFAR 36 does not need clarification, but rather &sect;&sect;145.51(b) and
145.53 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, which address return to service authority and maintenance of rated items,
need to be enforced. The FAA disagrees; the erroneous issuance of SFAR 36 authorizations demonstrates that ambiguity
exists in the current rule. The rule sections cited by the commenter are not at issue in improper SFAR 36 authorizations.
Increased enforcement of other regulations would not change the ambiguity that exists in SFAR 36.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggests that the three subsections of section 2 of the rule be considered into one paragraph, along
with other minor revisions. The FAA realizes that some of the material in these subsections is repeated, but the subsections
do refer to different sections of the regulations. Part of the confusion with the current SFAR stems from the very combinations
of information suggested by the commenter. Section 2 was divided into three sections in order to clarify what is available
to different applicants.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter suggests that section 6 of the NPRM be amended to add that the Administrator must approve within 15 days
a change in repair station staff necessary to meet other requirements of the regulation or a change in procedures approved
under a separate paragraph of the regulation. The FAA disagrees; often, more than 15 days is needed to conduct research
necessary to verify a new staff member's background and ability or to evaluate procedures. The FAA can not grant approval
to necessary staff personnel or procedures without thoroughly investigating all issues involved to ensure that
the level of safety intended by the rule continues to be met. No time limit for FAA approval will be added to Section 6.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that the qualifications of the SFAR 36 staff engineering personnel should be consistent with
qualifications assigned to Designated Engineering Representatives with regard to damage tolerance requirements.
The FAA agrees; this issue is addressed in Section 5(a)(3), which identifies engineering personnel that can determine
compliance with the applicable airworthiness requirements of the regulations. Therefore, no change is made to the
final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters propose that section 5 of the SFAR be amended to state that the applicant must have authority to repair
products or articles to be eligible to apply for an SFAR 36 authorization. The FAA agrees that this is a helpful clarification;
the final rule incorporates this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter proposes that the words ``article'' and ``product'' should both appear wherever one is currently used
to encompass all items intended. The FAA agrees in part, and has further determined that the final rule should reflect
one term where one most clearly states the applicability of the corresponding provision. For example, FAR Section
121.379(b) states that a certificate holder may approve for return to service a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
product
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 after maintenance, etc., performed under paragraph (a) of Section 121.379. FAR Section 145.51b states that a repair
station certificate holder may approve for return to service any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
article
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for which it is rated. Accordingly, the final rule has been revised to use ``product'' when referring to repairs performed
by air carrier and air taxi certificate holders, and to use ``article'' when referring to repairs performed by repair
station certificate holders; the final rule uses both terms where it does not distinguish between the certificate
holders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggests that clarification is needed as to whether a repair station may continue to utilize major repair
data developed previously under its SFAR 36 authorization if that authorization ceases, terminates, or expires.
The FAA agrees that a clarification is needed. A holder whose authorization has expired or has been terminated may
not use data previously developed under its authorization to perform a major repair and return the product or article
to service; the relevant provisions of FAR parts 121, 127, and 145 cited in Section 2 of the proposed and final rule prohibit
that return to service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, Section 7 of the final rule requires the holder to surrender its SFAR 36-developed data to the FAA. However,
the FAA acknowledges that a holder whose authorization has expired or been terminated may have a legitimate future
use for the data; e.g., the holder may apply to the FAA to have the data approved. Accordingly, to accommodate the FAA's
continued airworthiness concerns and a holder's interest in data it has developed, Section 7 of the final rule has
been revised to allow a former authorization holder to surrender its SFAR 36-developed data, or maintain its data
indefinitely and make the data available to the FAA for inspection.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section summarizes the regulatory evaluation prepared by the FAA on the amendments to 14 CFR parts 121, 127, 135,
and 145_Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 36, Development of Major Repair Data. This summary and the full regulatory
evaluation quantify, to the extent practicable, estimated costs and anticipated benefits to the private sector
consumers, and Federal, State, and local governments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this rulemaking is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined by Executive Order
12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review). The anticipated costs and benefits associated with this final rule are summarized
below. (A detailed discussion of costs and benefits is contained in the full regulatory evaluation in the docket for
this final rule).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Cost Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that the one-time total cost of compliance will be approximately $55 for the industry and about $840
for the FAA. This cost estimate was derived based upon two components: (1) Current SFAR 36 certificate holders (that
will not qualify under the amended rule) applying for a DER, and (2) FAA costs to review SFAR 36 and DER authorizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefit Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule, with the amended extension date, will allow certain firms to continue to operate under SFAR 36, and
will avoid economic hardship to those relying on it as it presently exists. The final rule will also eliminate ambiguities
that exist in the present rule. These ambiguities have allowed component repair stations that do not have return to
service authorization to receive SFAR 36 authorizations. Repair stations that specialize in component or piece
parts of products (instead of aircraft engines or air frames, for example) and are not returning those products to
service, do not necessarily possess the overall knowledge necessary for returning an article or product to service.
Only repair stations and air carriers that understand the form, fit, and function of an aircraft article or product
should be authorized to approve that article or product for return to service after a major repair.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been no known documented instances where aviation safety has been compromised as a result of these repaired
products being returned. Nevertheless, the level of certitude should not be compromised, and only those that understand
the form, fit, and function of the product should be permitted to return the product to service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The benefits of this action are the potential improvements in aviation safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Comparison of Costs and Benefits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The costs associated with this final rule ($55 to industry and $840 to the FAA) are minimal. In view of the negligible
costs of the rule, coupled with benefits in the form of enhanced safety to all aircraft operators, the FAA has determined
that the rule will be cost-beneficial.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) ensures that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately
burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The costs associated with this final rule are below any threshold
established by FAA Order 2100.143A. Therefore, the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on any small
entity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule will have neither an effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States,
nor an effect on the sale of U.S. products or services in foreign countries since it does not impose costs on aircraft
operators or U.S. or foreign aircraft manufacturers.

Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between
the national government and the states, nor the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule will not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Justification for Immediate Adoption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that delay in the adoption of this rule would cause undue burden to qualified domestic repair
stations, air carriers, air taxi operators with large aircraft, and commercial operators of large aircraft. These
companies use their SFAR 36 authorizations to develop and use data not formerly approved by the FAA for major repairs
on products and articles. Current SFAR 36 authorizations will terminate on January 23, 1994, and this rule must be
effective for the companies affected to continue to use data developed under the authorization to perform major repairs.
Accordingly, the FAA has determined that good cause exists to make this rule effective in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
I certify that this final rule: (1) Is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a
significant rule under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures for Simplification, Analysis, and Review of Regulations
(44 CFR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. In addition, this final rule has little
or no impact on trade opportunities for U.S. firms doing business overseas, or on foreign firms doing business in the
United States.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of Rulechange Sought:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To allow operators to complete a phased compliance schedule for installation of the 11-parameter digital flight
data recorders (DFDR) on aircraft between December 31, 1994, and December 31, 1999, and eliminate the need to make
costly DFDR retrofit to aircraft that will not be in the U.S. airline inventory at the end of the decade.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Petitioner's Reason for the Request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The petitioner feels that this amendment will save ATA operators alone $23,700,000; retrofit installation is not
supported via an aircraft manufacturer service bulletin, since the majority of aircraft models affected by the rule
are out of production; and any enhancement to the collection of flight history data may be of minimal benefit for the
airplanes that are to be retired between 1994 and 1999.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to supersede telegraphic airworthiness directive (AD) T89&hyph;05&hyph;52 by adopting
a new AD, applicable to Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines. Telegraphic AD T89&hyph;05&hyph;52
currently requires repetitive ultrasonic inspections of a combustion chamber outer case (CCOC) weld, but also allows
visual inspection or fluorescent magnetic penetrant inspection (FMPI) of certain CCOC's under specified conditions.
This proposal would allow ultrasonic inspections only. This proposal is prompted by the greater availability of
ultrasonic inspection equipment, which provides a more definitive means of discovering cracks than either visual
inspections or FMPI. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent rupture of the CCOC, which could
result in fire, engine cowl release, or aircraft damage.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 1, 1989, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued telegraphic airworthiness directive (AD) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
T89&hyph;05&hyph;52, applicable to Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series turbofan engines, which requires repetitive
ultrasonic inspections for cracks in the combustion chamber outer case (CCOC). In addition, that telegraphic AD
allowed operators who did not have ultrasonic inspection capability to perform visual inspections and fluorescent
magnetic penetrant inspections (FMPI) of CCOC's. That action was prompted by reports of two CCOC's, both part number
(P/N) 796761, which were found in service with severe cracking and distress at the weld which joins the forward case
detail to the rear flange detail. These cracks initiated from an area of incomplete weld created during the manufacturing
process and were not detected during the final inspection process. Another CCOC, P/N 806675, is manufactured using
a similar process and has the same potential for incomplete welds, but to date have not been found cracked. That condition,
if not corrected, could result in rupture of the CCOC, which could result in fire, engine cowl release, or aircraft
damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that telegraphic AD, the FAA has received reports that most operators now have the capability
to perform ultrasonic inspections, which provides a more definitive means of discovering cracks than either visual
inspections or FMPI. In telegraphic AD T89&hyph;05&hyph;52, reinspection of all CCOC's is required, including
reinspection of those CCOC's that exhibited minimal ultrasonic indications during initial inspection. The FAA
has determined analytically that CCOC's that exhibit maximum signal amplitudes of less than 40 percent are not life
limited at the defined weld area. Therefore, CCOC's that meet this signal criteria for two consecutive ultrasonic
inspections may be marked with a new P/N, provided the second ultrasonic inspection is accomplished at least 2,500
cycles in service (CIS) after the first inspection and the second inspection is performed in accordance with Appendix
C of PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 5842, Revision 3, dated October 10, 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the FAA has determined that certain CCOC's, P/N 806675, were ultrasonically inspected by PW during the manufacturing
process, and therefore do not need to be inspected again until they are accessible in the shop. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of PW ASB No. 5842, Revision 3, dated October 10, 1990, that
describes procedures for repetitive ultrasonic inspections of CCOC's for cracks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other engines of this same type design,
the proposed AD would supersede telegraphic AD T89&hyph;05&hyph;52 to require repetitive ultrasonic inspections
of CCOC's for cracks. The proposed AD would also allow CCOC's that meet certain signal criteria for two consecutive
ultrasonic inspections to be marked with a new P/N. Once remarked, those CCOC's would not need to meet the repetitive
ultrasonic inspection requirements of this AD. Finally, the proposed AD would require ultrasonic inspections on
certain CCOC's, P/N 806675, identified by serial number, that were ultrasonically inspected by PW during the manufacturing
process, when they are accessible in the shop. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service
bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 1,000 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD,
that it would take approximately 2 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor
rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $110,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all British Aerospace
Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes. This proposal would require that certain landing
gear brakes be inspected for wear and replaced if the wear limits prescribed in this proposal are not met, and that the
specified wear limits be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. This proposal is prompted
by an accident in which a transport category airplane executed a rejected takeoff (RTO) and was unable to stop on the
runway due to worn brakes; and the subsequent review of allowable brake wear limits for all transport category airplanes.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy
RTO.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1988, a McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplane was involved in an aborted takeoff accident in which
eight of the ten brakes failed and the airplane ran off the end of the runway. Investigation revealed that there were
failed pistons on each of the eight brakes, with O-rings damaged by over-extension due to extensive wear. Fluid leaking
from the damaged pistons caused the hydraulic fuses to close, releasing all brake pressure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This accident prompted a review of allowable wear limits for all brakes installed on transport category airplanes.
The FAA and the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) jointly developed a set of dynamometer test guidelines that
could be used to validate appropriate wear limits for all airplane brakes. It should be noted that this worn brake accountability
determination validates brake wear limits with respect to brake energy capacity only and is not meant to account for
any reduction in brake force due solely to the wear state of the brake. The guidelines for validating brake wear limits
allow credit for use of reverse thrust with a critical engine inoperative to determine the energy level absorbed by
the brake during the dynamometer test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has requested that airframe manufacturers of transport category airplanes: (1) Determine required adjustments
in allowable wear limits for all of its brakes in use; (2) schedule dynamometer testing to validate wear limits as necessary;
and (3) submit information from items (1) and (2) to the FAA so that appropriate rulemaking action(s) can be initiated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
British Aerospace has conducted worn brake rejected takeoff (RTO) dynamometer testing and analyses on various brakes
installed on Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes. Based on the results of that testing and
analyses, the FAA has determined that the maximum brake wear limits currently recommended in the Component Maintenance
Manual for Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 series airplanes equipped with brakes manufactured by Allied Signal Aerospace
Company (Bendix) are acceptable as they relate to the effectiveness of the brakes during a high energy RTO. The FAA
also finds that the maximum brake wear limits currently recommended in the Component Maintenance Manual for Model
BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes equipped with Bendix brakes are not acceptable as they relate to the effectiveness
of the brakes during a high energy RTO. Consequently, the FAA has determined that the brake wear limits for Model BAC
1&hyph;11&hyph;200 series airplanes and the new brake wear limits for Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes
must be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that, in order to prevent loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy RTO, the following
maximum brake wear limits are necessary for Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes equipped
with Bendix brakes:

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require that certain landing gear brakes be inspected
for wear and replaced if the wear limits prescribed in this proposal are not met, and that the specified wear limits
be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 100 Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes of the affected design
in the worldwide fleet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 10 Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 2 U.S. operators would
be affected by this proposed AD. For these airplanes and operators, although the proposed rule would require the incorporation
of maximum brake wear limits into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program, no other specific additional
action, inspection, or part replacement costs relative to that requirement would be involved; such actions are currently
a part of the current maintenance program. However, it is estimated that it would take approximately 1 work hour, at
an average labor rate of $55 per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the requirement into its FAA-approved
maintenance inspection program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed requirement to revise
the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program on U.S. operators of Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 series airplanes
is estimated to be $110, or $55 per operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 20 Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 19 U.S. operators would
be affected by this proposed AD. It is estimated that it would take approximately 1 work hour, at an average labor rate
of $55 per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the proposed revision of its FAA-approved maintenance inspection
program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that proposed requirement on U.S. operators of Model BAC
1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes is estimated to be $1,045, or $55 per operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the FAA estimates that for operators of Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes, it would take
approximately 2 work hours per airplane to shorten the wear pins for replacement brakes, and 8 work hours per airplane
to change the brakes, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost of required parts to accomplish the change
in wear limits for these airplanes (that is, the cost resulting from the requirement to change the brakes before they
are worn to their previously approved limits for a one-time change) would be approximately $912 per airplane. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of these proposed requirements on U.S. operators of Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400
series airplanes is estimated to be $29,240, or $1,462 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These total cost figures are based on the assumption that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements
of this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

that brake part number. Revision 5 of the Allied Signal Component Maintenance Manual will reflect the revised brake
wear limit of 1.0 inch. Brake units having wear indicators set at 1.06 inch will be considered to be fully worn when either
wear indicator pin is 1.0 inch or less above the surface of the carrier, provided the wear pin has not been shortened
on that brake unit.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace at Bullhead City, AZ. A Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Distance
Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) standard instrument approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the Bullhead
Laughlin Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace extending from 700 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft
executing the approach. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument
flight rules (IFR) operations at Bullhead Laughlin Municipal Airport.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Bullhead City, AZ. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR
operators executing the VOR/DME approach at Bullhead Laughlin, AZ. The coordinates for this airspace docket are
based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated
June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July
6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 10034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace at Payson, AZ. A NonDirectional Beacon (NDB) standard instrument
approach procedure (SIAP) has been developed for the Payson Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace extending from
700 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The intended effect of this proposal is to
provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at Payson Municipal Airport.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Payson, AZ. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators
executing the NDB&hyph;A approach at Payson, AZ. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American
Datum 83. Class E airspace areas are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective
September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The class E airspace
designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is
not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 10034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory
evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic
procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

 The National Institute of Standards and Technology requests comments on the proposed amendments contained in this
document to the regulations found at part 290 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations, which implement the Regional
Centers for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology. This change revises the matching fund requirements in the
fifth and sixth years of operation to reflect program experience during the first five years. With this change, the
maximum allowable Federal funding will be one third of total expenses during years five and six. Currently, the maximum
allowable Federal funding is 30 percent in year five and 20 percent in year six. This change also modifies the requirements
for cash match. With this change, at least half of the match must be in cash or full-time personnel loaned to the operating
organization. Currently at least 55 percent of the match must be in cash or full-time personnel.

 The National Institute of Standards and Technology requests comments regarding proposed changes to the matching
funds requirements for the Regional Centers for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology (Manufacturing Technology
Centers, MTC) program found at part 290 of title 15 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The MTC program provides financial
and technical assistance to regional centers (MTCs) which work directly with small and medium sized manufacturing
firms to advance their level of manufacturing technology. The MTCs are selected on a competitive basis in accordance
with the regulation at 15 CFR part 290.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part of the funding for each MTC is provided by a Federal cooperative agreement and the balance (the ``match'') is provided
through a variety of means by the operating organization. The match is generally provided as a combination of non-Federal
public funds or in-kind match, contributions of cash or in-kind resources from private sources, and earned income
of the MTC. The authorizing legislation allows Federal funding of up to half the total budget (cash and in-kind) in
the first three years and requires that the Secretary adopt regulations which specify a declining level of Federal
support during the next three years. The current regulation specifies those maximum funding levels to be 40 percent,
30 percent, and 20 percent in years four through six respectively. The changes proposed to part 290 will specify those
maximum funding levels to be 40 percent, 1/3, and 1/3 in years four through six respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current regulation requires that 55 percent of the match be in cash or full-time personnel. There is no statutory
requirement for this cash ratio. The changes proposed to part 290 will specify that half of the match be in cash or full-time
personnel.

This document was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. The General Counsel
has certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that this rule will not have a significant
economic effect on a substantial number of small entities requiring a flexibility analysis under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act because the proposed rule changes will affect only those governmental units that are selected to
receive funding under the Program. The program is entirely voluntary for the participants that seek funding. It is
not a major federal action requiring an environmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act. The
Regional Centers for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology Program does not involve the mandatory payment of
any matching funds from a state or local government, and does not affect directly any state or local government. Accordingly,
the Technology Administration has determined that Executive Order 12372 is not applicable to this program. This
notice does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism
assessment under Executive Order 12612.

 In this action EPA proposes approval of the state implementation plan (SIP) for the Columbia Falls, Montana nonattainment
area submitted by the State of Montana to achieve attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)
for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM&hyph;10).
The SIP was submitted by Montana to satisfy certain federal Clean Air Act requirements for an approvable moderate
nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 SIP for Columbia Falls. EPA is also proposing approval of the Flathead County Air Pollution
Control Program.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Columbia Falls, Montana area was designated nonattainment for PM&hyph;10 and classified as moderate under sections
107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991) and 40 CFR 81.327 (specifying designation for Columbia Falls and vicinity). The
air quality planning requirements for moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are set out in Subparts 1 and 4 of Title
I of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and
SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM&hyph;10
nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)).
Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble
for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of Title I advanced in today's proposal and the supporting rationale.
In today's rulemaking action on the Montana moderate PM&hyph;10 SIP, EPA is proposing to apply its interpretations
considering the specific factual issues presented. Thus, EPA will consider any timely submitted comments before
taking final action on today's proposal.

 nonattainment areas. At times, Subpart 1 and Subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted to clarify the relationship

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those States containing initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required to submit, among other things,
the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions
from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control
technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously
as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every 3 years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress
(RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also
apply to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such
sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c),
188, and 189 of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some provisions are due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas were required
to submit a permit program for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10
by June 30, 1992 (see section 189(a)). Such States also were required to submit contingency measures by November 15,
1993 that become effective without further action by the State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has
failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. See section 172(c)(9)
and 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512, 13543&hyph;13544.

II. This Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is today proposing approval of the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area control plan. The Columbia Falls
SIP consists of two submittals. The first contains the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program and Air Pollution
Plan regulations. Flathead County contains two PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas for which SIPs were due in November 1991: Columbia Falls and Kalispell. The Flathead County regulations
apply to both areas and were submitted with the attainment demonstration for Kalispell on November 25, 1991, after
being approved by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences (MBHES) on November 15, 1991. The Columbia
Falls SIP and attainment demonstration were not submitted at that time since a permit necessary to the control strategy
for the SIP was not finalized. The MBHES issued that permit and approved the SIP on January 24, 1992. This second submittal
to EPA was made by the Governor on May 6, 1992. Final technical corrections to the SIP were received by EPA on June 15,
1993. In this action, EPA is proposing to approve the Flathead County rules (with the exception of rules 501 through
506 which are specific to the city of Kalispell_EPA will take separate action on the Kalispell PM

 nonattainment area control plan) and the Columbia Falls PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area control plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To address deficiencies identified by EPA, the State adopted commitments after public hearings on November 15, 1991
and January 24, 1992, and submitted the commitments to EPA with the Governor's May 6, 1992 letter, as additional tasks
to be completed to correct the deficiencies in the Columbia Falls and statewide SIP. The State has fulfilled commitments
related to SIP requirements due November 15, 1991 for the Columbia Falls nonattainment area. Those items related
to deficiencies in the statewide SIP will be addressed in a separate action. EPA has determined that the Columbia Falls
SIP can be fully approved without the State fulfilling the remaining commitments. Therefore, EPA is tracking the
State's efforts to meet these commitments, but approval of the SIP for the Columbia Falls nonattainment area is not
contingent upon the State meeting them by the specified dates (a more detailed discussion of these commitments can
be found in the Technical Support Document (TSD) for this proposed action). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State has made a separate commitment to testing and further dispersion modeling of emissions from the Columbia
Falls Aluminum Company (CFAC) facility. This facility is located outside the nonattainment area and emissions from
CFAC were not identified on the Chemical Mass Balance analysis of filters collected from the monitor in the Columbia
Falls nonattainment area. Emissions from CFAC are a potential concern, however, since this source accounts for 20
percent of the emission inventory (at permitted allowable emissions). EPA will continue to monitor the testing and
assist the State with any action required by the results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
In today's action, EPA is proposing to grant approval of those elements of the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 plan that
were due on November 15, 1991, and submitted by the State on November 25, 1991, and May 6, 1992 (excluding the Kalispell
portion of the county regulations). EPA believes that the Columbia Falls plan meets those applicable requirements
of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 SIP was not submitted by November 15, 1991, as required by section 189(a)(2)(A)
of the Act, EPA made a finding that the State failed to submit the SIP, pursuant to section 179 of the Act, and notified
the Governor in a letter dated December 16, 1991. See 57 FR 19906 (May 8, 1992). After the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10
SIP was submitted on May 6, 1992, EPA found the submittal complete pursuant to section 110(k)(1) of the Act and notified
the Governor accordingly in a letter dated August 7, 1992. This completeness determination corrected the State's
deficiency and, therefore, terminated the sanctions clock under section 179 of the Act.

A. Analysis of State Submission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Procedural Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.

3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Also section 172(c)(7) of the Act requires that plan provisions for nonattainment areas meet the applicable provisions
of Section 110(a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V (1992). The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission.
However, a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months
after receipt of the submission.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To entertain public comment on the implementation plan for Columbia Falls, the State of Montana held a public hearing
on November 15, 1991, for the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program. A second hearing was held on January 24,
1992, to address the Plum Creek Manufacturing, Inc. permit and the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 SIP. The State supplied
evidence that adequate public notice for these hearings was provided. Following the public hearings, the local air
pollution control plan and the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 SIP were adopted by the State. The submittal for the Flathead
County Air Pollution Control Program was signed by the Governor on November 25, 1991. The submittal for the final Columbia
Falls PM&hyph;10 SIP was signed by the Governor on May 6, 1992. The final plan was received by EPA on May 12, 1992 as a proposed
revision to the SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revisions were reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set
out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V (1992). The submittal was found to be complete and a letter, dated August 7, 1992, was
forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittal and the next steps to be taken in the review
process. In today's action EPA proposes to approve the Montana PM&hyph;10 SIP submittals for Columbia Falls, as dated
November 25, 1991 (with the exception of the Kalispell specific rules) and May 6, 1992, with technical revisions dated
June 15, 1993, and invites public comment on the action.

2. Accurate Emission Inventory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 172(c)(3) of the Act requires that nonattainment plan provisions include a comprehensive, accurate, current
inventory of actual emissions from all sources of relevant pollutants in the nonattainment area. The emission inventory
also should include a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of allowable emissions in the area. Because
the submission of such inventories is a necessary adjunct to an area's attainment demonstration (or demonstration
that the area cannot practicably attain), the emission inventories must be received with the submission (see 57 FR
13539). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia Falls' base year emission inventory was developed for July 1, 1989, through June 30, 1990. The results were
segregated into seasonal winter and spring emissions. On an annual basis, industrial facilities account for 56.5%
of the PM&hyph;10 emissions, with industrial processes and fugitive industrial road dust responsible for 78.8 and
21.2% of this percentage, respectively. Area sources account for 43% of the total annual PM&hyph;10 emissions, with
re-entrained road dust responsible for 89% of all area source contributions. Residential wood burning area sources
accounted for 4.3% of total annual PM&hyph;10 emissions in Columbia Falls. The emission inventory shows that the
emissions are seasonal, with re-entrained road dust the primary source in the summer and industrial sources the largest
contributor during the fall, winter, and spring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is proposing to approve the emission inventory because it is accurate and comprehensive, and provides a sufficient
basis for determining the adequacy of the attainment demonstration for this area consistent with the requirements
of sections 172(c)(3) and 110(a)(2)(K) of the Act.

A more detailed discussion of the source/source category contributions and their associated control measures (including
available control technology) can be found in the TSD for this proposed action. EPA has reviewed the State's documentation
and concluded that it adequately justifies the control measures to be implemented. The implementation of Montana's
PM&hyph;10 nonattainment plan will result in the attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. By this
action EPA is proposing to approve the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 plan's RACM (including RACT) in its entirety.

the Act). The attainment demonstration for Columbia Falls was conducted using receptor modeling (CMB) and rollback
modeling. The 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS is 150 micrograms/cubic meter (

The Clean Air Act calls for attainment by December 31, 1994. Section 188(c)(1). EPA interprets the State's demonstration
as providing for attainment by January 1, 1995. EPA is proposing to approve the State's demonstration on the basis
of the de minimis differential between the two dates. The State should promptly inform EPA if EPA has in any manner misinterpreted
the date by which the State has demonstrated attainment in the Columbia Falls nonattainment area.

5. PM&hyph;10 Precursors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The control requirements that are applicable to major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 also apply to major stationary
sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors, unless EPA determines such sources do not contribute significantly to PM&hyph;10
levels over the NAAQS in that area (see section 189(e) of the Act). An analysis of air quality and emissions data for
the Columbia Falls nonattainment area indicates that exceedances of the NAAQS are attributable chiefly to direct
particulate emissions from re-entrained road dust, stationary sources and residential wood burning. Neither the
emission inventory nor the CMB analysis for Columbia Falls revealed any major stationary sources of PM&hyph;10 precursors.
Consequently, EPA is proposing to find that major sources of precursors of PM&hyph;10 do not contribute significantly
to PM&hyph;10 levels in excess of the NAAQS. The consequences of this proposed finding are to exclude these sources
from the applicability of PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area control requirements. Further discussion of the analyses
and supporting rationale for EPA's proposed finding are contained in the TSD accompanying this proposed action.
Note that while EPA is proposing to make a general finding for this area, today's finding is based on the current character
of the area including, for example, the existing mix of sources in the area. It is possible, therefore, that future
growth could change the significance of precursors in the area. The EPA intends to issue future guidance addressing
such potential changes in the significance of precursor emissions in an area.

6. Quantitative Milestones and Reasonable Further Progress
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area plan revisions demonstrating attainment must contain quantitative milestones
which are to be achieved every 3 years until the area is redesignated attainment and which demonstrate RFP, as defined
in section 171(1), toward attainment by December 31, 1994 (see section 189(c) of the Act). The State of Montana's PM&hyph;10
SIP indicates that the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences (MDHES) and the Flathead County Health
Department (FCHD) will submit to EPA a reasonable further progress/milestone report consistent with federal guidelines
by December 31, 1994.

Thus, this report will be submitted coincident with the December 31, 1994 attainment date. The de minimis timing differential
between the first milestone submittal date (i.e. November 15, 1994) and the attainment date make it administratively
impracticable to require separate submittals.

In addition, FCHD will prepare less detailed annual progress reports for the prior year by August 1st each year. These
annual progress reports shall provide information on the effectiveness of the control strategies for re-entrained
road dust. The MDHES will add a progress report for the Plum Creek facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To monitor the progress of the road dust control rules, a report will be completed on the type and amount of de-icing
and sanding material applied, the number of applications of de-icing and sanding materials, the dates of application
of each material, and where and when the street sweeping and flushing occurred during the winter season. The sanding
material test results for the percent silt and durability also will be submitted.

All exceedances of the PM&hyph;10 standard will be evaluated and a determination made as to the source of the exceedance.
Changes in the air quality program to prevent further exceedances and a timetable for implementation will be developed.
Any other EPA requirements for RFP reports will be incorporated as necessary.

7. Enforceability Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see sections 172(c)(6) and 110(a)(2)(A)
of the Act and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in
a September 23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (see 57 FR 13541). Nonattainment area plan provisions also must contain a program to provide for enforcement of control
measures and other elements in the SIP (see section 110(a)(2)(C) of the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific control measures contained in the SIP are addressed above in section 3, ``RACM (including RACT).'' The
Columbia Falls air pollution control regulations, as included in the SIP, are legally enforceable by FCHD. Any person
who violates any provision or rule, with the exception of the voluntary solid-fuel burning device rule, or order under
this program shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $500.00.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Flathead County Pollution Control Program and the associated local regulations are also enforceable by the MDHES,
if the FCHD fails to administer the program. Since the program has been approved by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental
Sciences (MBHES) in accordance with section 75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Code Annotated and effectuated by
a MBHES order, and since the MDHES can enforce MBHES orders, the MDHES has independent enforcement powers. Enforcement
provisions are found in the Clean Air Act of Montana, sections 75&hyph;2&hyph;401 through 75&hyph;2&hyph;429,
Montana Code Annotated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The emission limits for Plum Creek are enforceable by the MDHES through air quality permit 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2667&hyph;M with a final modification date of January 24, 1992. Section 75&hyph;2&hyph;401 of the Montana Code Annotated
allows the MDHES to seek civil penalties for a violation of a permit limitation. Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM)
16.8.1112 allows the MDHES to revoke a permit for a violation of a permit limitation. These regulations are contained
in the ARM 16.8.101 through 16.8.1602 and violations of these rules are punishable by civil penalties in an amount
up to $10,000 per day and criminal penalties in an amount up to $1,000 per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State relies on a local government for the implementation of any plan provision, then, according to section 110(a)(2)(E)(iii)
of the Act, the State must provide necessary assurances that the State has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation
of such plan provision. A State would have responsibility to ensure adequate implementation when, for example, the
State has the authority and resources to implement the provision, and the local entity has failed to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program was established in accordance with the requirements of section
75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Code Annotated, as amended (1991). On November 15, 1991, the MBHES issued a board
order approving the local program and regulations. A stipulation between the MDHES and the Flathead County Air Pollution
Control Board that delineates responsibilities and authorities between the MDHES and the local authorities was
signed November 15, 1991. The regulations, board order, and stipulation were submitted to EPA as a revision to the
Montana SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State also submitted a state Attorney General's opinion interpreting the authority of the MDHES to enforce any
state and local air quality provisions if a local air quality program fails to do so. In practice, the MBHES issues a
board order when it approves a local program or amendments to a program. Since the Montana Clean Air Act authorizes
the MDHES to enforce board orders issued by the MBHES, the MDHES has the authority to assume jurisdiction over, and
implement, a local program so approved. However, the Montana Clean Air Act also requires a hearing before the MBHES
before such an assumption of jurisdiction and authority can be taken. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Flathead County rules are in effect now, as are the State's permit modification for Plum Creek. The State of Montana
has a program that will ensure that the measures contained in the Columbia Falls PM&hyph;10 SIP are adequately enforced.
EPA believes that the State's and Columbia Falls' existing air enforcement program will be adequate. The TSD for this
proposed action contains further information on enforceability requirements, responsibilities, and a discussion
of the personnel and funding intended to support effective implementation of the control measures.

8. Contingency Measures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 172(c)(9) of the Act, all moderate nonattainment area SIPs that demonstrate attainment must
include contingency measures. See generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544. These measures must
be submitted by November 15, 1993 for the initial moderate nonattainment areas. Contingency measures should consist
of other available measures that are not part of the area's control strategy. These measures must take effect without
further action by the State or EPA, upon EPA's determination that the area has failed to make RFP or attain the PM&hyph;10
NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline. The Columbia Falls nonattainment area SIP contains an outline of steps
to be taken if attainment of the PM&hyph;10 standard is not achieved; however, these steps do not adequately satisfy
the contingency measures requirement. Since the SIP does not provide for these measures to take effect without further
action should EPA determine that Columbia Falls has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM&hyph;10 standard by December
31, 1994, EPA is taking no action at this time on the Columbia Falls contingency measures. The State has until November
15, 1993 to submit its contingency measures.

III. Implications of This Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to approve the PM&hyph;10 SIP submitted to EPA on November 25, 1991 (with the exception of the Kalispell
specific rules, 501&hyph;506) and on May 6, 1992 for the Columbia Falls, Montana nonattainment area. Among other
things, the State of Montana has demonstrated that the Columbia Falls moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area will
attain the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also proposing to approve the Flathead County Air Pollution Control Program as it applies to Columbia Falls,
which was submitted to EPA on November 25, 1991. The portion of the plan concerning the Kalispell PM&hyph;10 nonattainment
area will be acted upon in a separate action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted, additional submittals for the initial moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas are due at later dates.
The EPA will determine the adequacy of any such submittal as appropriate.

IV. Request for Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of today's proposal. As indicated at the outset of this document, EPA
will consider any comments received by February 28, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Executive Order (EO) 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 Action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. The U.S.
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue
the waiver until such time as it rules on U.S. EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order
12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.

VI. Regulatory Flexibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements, but
simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does
not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected. Moreover,
due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility
analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean Air Act forbids
EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 1, 1993, (58 FR 51279) the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed rulemaking in response to an
October 22, 1990, Petition for Reconsideration filed with the Administrator. This Petition requested that EPA reconsider
and revise the requirements of the Chicago Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) for Ozone (which was promulgated June
29, 1990 (55 FR 26814)) as they pertain to Stepan Company's Millsdale Plant (Stepan) manufacturing facility in Elwood,
Illinois.

On December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63547) at the request of Stepan, EPA extended the comment period until December 16, 1993.
On December 2, 1993, Stepan requested that the comment period be extended until February 15, 1994 based upon the complexity
of the proposed rule and issues raised about the content of the record. At Stepan's request EPA is extending the public
comment period until February 15, 1994.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved portions of the Ohio SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Hamilton County on January 27, 1981 (46 FR 8481), and April 20, 1982 (47 FR 16784),
and the remaining portion on May 13, 1982 (47 FR 20586). The portion of Hamilton County which was originally designated
a nonattainment area for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was redesignated to attainment on March 19, 1982 (47 FR 11870). Hamilton County was divided into two separate attainment
areas on May 13, 1982 (47 FR 20586). However, since the time of those rulemakings, three modeling analyses have been
submitted to EPA which predicted violations of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) due to SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions from existing sources that are located in Hamilton County, Ohio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the predicted violations, EPA notified the Governor of Ohio on December 22, 1988, under section 110(a)(2)(H)
of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(H), that the SIP for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is substantially inadequate to attain and maintain the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS in Hamilton County. The notification provided the State with 60 days to submit a commitment and schedule for
the development of an approvable SIP and up to 18 months from the date of notification to submit a fully State adopted
SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 plan for Hamilton County, which assures the attainment and maintenance of the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS both in Hamilton County and the surrounding area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 28, 1991, Valdas V. Adamkus, Regional Administrator, EPA, sent a letter to Donald R. Schregardus, Director,
OEPA formalizing an agreement between EPA and OEPA regarding action toward SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 attainment status for Hamilton County, Ohio. On September 9, 1991, OEPA sent EPA a proposed revision to the Hamilton
County SO

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP. The signed State adopted rules were received by EPA on October 18, 1991. The rules package submitted for approval
consisted of revisions to Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) 3745&hyph;18&hyph;03

, as well as a modeling analysis intended to demonstrate that the limits in these regulations are sufficient to assure
attainment of the NAAQS for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in Hamilton County. A completeness review was performed and, on November 8, 1991, EPA determined that the package
was complete.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 7, 1992, William L. MacDowell, Chief, Regulation Development Section-Region 5, EPA, sent a letter to Robert
Hodanbosi, of the OEPA, detailing issues EPA had identified in the State's September 9, 1991 submittal. On March 19,
1993, the State responded with a subsequent submittal which addressed the above mentioned issues, and included a
Director's Finding and Order governing the operation of selected boilers at Cincinnati Gas and Electric's Miami
Fort facility. Additional technical information supporting the March 19th submittal was received from OEPA by EPA
on May 18, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A major issue in the development of the revised submittal involved the incorporation of the Rough Terrain Diffusion
Model (RTDM). The RTDM is one of many computer models available used to simulate the dispersion of air pollutants.
A ``Model Evaluation and Comparison Study'' was conducted by the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce, in cooperation
with the OEPA and EPA Region 5, in order to determine which model, or combination of models, (Industrial Source Complex
(ISC) Short-term model or the RTDM) was most accurate in predicting SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentrations in Hamilton County. This study was conducted in accordance with a protocol that EPA agreed to on October
31, 1990, and in accordance with EPA document entitled ``Interim Procedures for Evaluating Air Quality Models (Revised),''
1984. Based on the results of the study, EPA approved the RTDM model for use in modeling sulfur dioxide sources in Hamilton
County in a June 9, 1992, letter from David Kee, Director, Air and Radiation Division, to Robert Hodanbosi, Chief,
Division of Air Pollution Control. The model/monitor comparison study is discussed more completely in the Technical
Support Document associated with this document.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Attainment Demonstration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The principal requirement for the Ohio SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP under section 110, as identified in the SIP deficiency notice, is that the plan provides sufficient enforceable
measures to assure attainment of the NAAQS for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As noted above, the State provided enforceable limits in the form of State regulations, supplemented by an administrative
order for one source, along with an air dispersion modeling analysis which demonstrates that these limits assure
attainment in the Hamilton County area. The modeling techniques used in the demonstration supporting this revision
were based on procedures in the ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised),'' July 1986, including ``Supplement
A,'' July 1987. The modeling methodology is discussed more fully in the Technical Support Document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The attainment demonstration incorporated three different air dispersion models: Industrial Source Complex Short-Term
(ISCST), COMPLEX I (Valley Screen Mode for analyzing intermediate terrain), and the Rough Terrain Diffusion Model
(RTDM). Some basic components of the modeling methodology are:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Meteorological Data&hyph;The ISCST modeling used the most recent five years of meteorological data while RTDM used
one year of meteorological data collected in Hamilton County. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rural/Urban Classification&hyph;Western Hamilton County sources were modeled in the Rural mode while sources
in the east were modeled using Urban mode 3. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emission Inventory&hyph;The emission sources used in the modeling represent maximum short-term operating rates
and stack parameters. Actual operating factors were gathered and used to evaluate annual SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 predicted concentrations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background Concentrations&hyph;The 3-hour, 24-hour, and annual averaging background concentrations were determined
for both the eastern and western grids. The background values were based on monitoring data and are considered representative
of SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 concentrations being contributed from unmodeled sources in the Hamilton County area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Good Engineering Practice (GEP) stack heights or actual stack heights, where appropriate, were used in Ohio's modeling
in accordance with EPA guidance. However, a January 22, 1988, remand in a U.S. D.C. Court of Appeals case involving
EPA stack height regulations remains unresolved
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. It is possible that future resolution of this case will result in the State being required to revise the emission limitations
for the CG&amp;E Miami Fort facility.

In the modeling for the attainment demonstration for Hamilton County, the State did not use the most recent version
of the Industrial Source Complex model, known as ISC2. The ISC2 version of the Industrial Source Complex model was
released after the State submitted its SIP to EPA, and well after the completion of the ISCST modeling used to determine
appropriate SIP limits. Consequently, EPA proposes to accept analysis under the older model for the purpose of this
SIP review. However, acceptance of the ISCST analysis for this reason should not apply to any other analysis of this
area to support any future regulatory action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the majority of the attainment demonstration was comprised of output from ISCST, several areas of Hamilton
County were modeled using RTDM. The RTDM modeling was performed in accordance with the EPA approved ``Model Evaluation
and Comparison Study'' described earlier. The modeling demonstration accompanying the SIP revision submittal
incorporated dispersion modeling output from the ISCST model in combination with RTDM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issues identified in the May 7, 1992, letter from William L. MacDowell, Chief, Regulation Development Section-Region
5, EPA to Robert Hodanbosi, of the OEPA, regarding the September 9, 1991 submittal, needed to be resolved before EPA
could approve the SIP revisions. One of those issues involved modeled SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 violations near the Joseph E. Seagram and Sons, Inc. (Seagram's) facility in Dearborn County, Indiana. These modeled
violations were primarily due to emissions from the Seagrams facility in Indiana. However, CG&amp;E, located in
Hamilton County, Ohio, contributed to the critical concentration in that area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In response to the modeled violation, a commitment has been obtained from Seagram's, formalized in a letter from Seagrams
to both the OEPA and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, dated September 1, 1992, agreeing to not
operate its two boilers simultaneously on sulfur-bearing fuels without written permission from both State Agencies.
Utilizing this commitment, the OEPA submitted supplementary modeling which demonstrated that areas near Seagrams,
in Indiana, did not exceed the sulfur dioxide NAAQS. However, in order for the Seagrams limit to be federally enforceable,
it must be incorporated into the Indiana sulfur dioxide SIP. Therefore, the Hamilton County SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP revision will be approved if the Seagrams commitment, described above, is adopted into the Indiana SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 SIP revision final rulemaking. This issue and other issues addressed by Ohio's submittals of March 19, 1993, and May
18, 1993, are discussed in detail in the Technical Support Document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the foregoing, EPA concludes that the results from Ohio's modeling demonstration, utilizing the ISCST and
RTDM air dispersion models, show that when the applicable emission limits and other restrictions are imposed, attainment
of the NAAQS for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 will be demonstrated in and around Hamilton County.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Compliance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The general compliance determination method denoted in OAC 3745&hyph;18&hyph;04(D)(7), which applies specifically
to Hamilton County, utilizes stack gas sampling using Methods 1 through 4 and 6, 6A, 6B, or 6C, as specified in 40 CFR
60.46, for any fuel burning equipment. Additional compliance monitoring is required under OAC 3745&hyph;18&hyph;04(D)(8),
which, on a source-specific basis, requires either daily or weekly coal sampling. EPA has determined, based on guidance
contained in the ``General preamble for future proposed rulemakings,'' published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13498), that compliance methods 1 through 4, 6, 6A, 6B, and 6C, in conjunction with regular fuel
sampling, provide for continuous SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 compliance monitoring. Additionally, documentation criteria listed in OAC 3745&hyph;18&hyph;04(I) requires
sources subject to the Hamilton County emission limits to document and retain information needed to demonstrate
compliance with applicable emission limits, emission tracking requirements, and/or operating limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act contains general requirements for implementation plans submitted by a State.
These are requirements which apply to all SIPs submitted by a State including attainment area plans, such as the plan
for Hamilton County. A fundamental requirement of this section is that each plan must include enforceable emission
limitations and other techniques necessary to meet the applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act. EPA has determined
that the emission limits and control measures listed in the SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP revision for Hamilton County, when fully implemented, will be enforceable, and, will provide for attainment
of the NAAQS for SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and thus satisfy the applicable requirements. As stated above, this determination is contingent upon the Seagrams
limits being incorporated into the Indiana SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP and, as a result, made federally enforceable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Therefore, EPA is proposing to conditionally approve revisions to Ohio Administrative Code (OAC) rules 3745&hyph;18&hyph;03,
3745&hyph;18&hyph;04, and 3745&hyph;18&hyph;37. The OAC rules 3745&hyph;18&hyph;03 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Attainment Dates and Compliance Time Schedules
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 provide specific time schedules for sources receiving revised emission limits to implement necessary changes and
demonstrate compliance. The OAC rules 3745&hyph;18&hyph;04 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Measurement Methods and Procedures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 specify the compliance determination methodologies for sources receiving revised emission limits. The OAC rules
3745&hyph;18&hyph;37 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hamilton County Emission Limits
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 amend the sulfur dioxide emission limits for Hamilton County. EPA is also proposing to approve the Director's Findings
and Order containing a fuel quality limit for select sources at Cincinnati Gas and Electric's Miami Fort facility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 110(k)(4), pertaining to conditional approval, the SIP elements regarding the Seagrams limits must
be adopted by the State of Indiana, by a date not later than one year after the date of approval of the Hamilton County,
Ohio SIP revision. In addition, the adopting State must submit these rules to EPA within a reasonable time after such
adoption. In this case, if the State of Indiana fails to adopt or submit the necessary rules to EPA within the required
time frame (one year from the date of final approval of the Hamilton County, Ohio SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP revision), this approval would become a disapproval upon USEPA notification of Ohio by letter. The EPA subsequently
would publish a notice announcing this action in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the State of Indiana adopts and submits the rule within the above timeframe, the conditionally approved rules
would remain a part of the SIP pending final action on the new submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on EPA's proposal to conditionally approve. Public
comments received by February 28, 1994 will be considered in the development of EPA's final rulemaking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. EPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic,
and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table
2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12866 for a period of 2 years.
EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver
until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded
Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
(5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Conditional SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the conditional approval is converted to a disapproval under section 110(k), based on a State's failure to meet
the commitment, it will not affect any existing state requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval
of the state submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does
not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because itdoes not remove existing state requirements
nor does it substitute a new Federal requirement. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any
new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due
to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis
would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids EPA to base its
actions concerning SIPS on such grounds.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to designate critical habitat for the threatened marbled murrelet
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachyramphus marmoratus marmoratus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) in Washington, Oregon, and California under the Endangered Species Act, as amended (Act). The marbled murrelet
is a small seabird of the Alcidae family that forages in the near-shore marine environment and nests in large trees
in coniferous forest along the coast. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed critical habitat units are located on Federal lands. This proposed critical habitat designation would
result in additional protection requirements under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that are funded,
authorized, or carried out by Federal agencies. Section 4 of the Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat
on the basis of the best scientific information available and to consider the economic and other relevant impacts
of including particular areas in the designation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On January 15, 1988, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) received a petition to list the marbled murrelet
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachyramphus marmoratus marmoratus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in Washington, Oregon, and California as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended
(Act). On October 17, 1988 (53 FR 40479), the Service published a finding that the petition had presented substantial
information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. Because of the increased research effort and
new information available, the status review period was reopened, with the concurrence of the petitioners, from
March 5, 1990, through May 31, 1990 (55 FR 4913). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 20, 1991 (56 FR 28362), the Service published a proposal to list the marbled murrelet in Washington, Oregon,
and California as a threatened species. The comment period was reopened for 30 days on January 30, 1992 (57 FR 3804),
to gather the most updated information on the species. Following a court order by the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Washington denying a 6-month extension, the Service published the final rule listing the marbled murrelet
in Washington, Oregon, and California as a threatened species on October 1, 1992 (57 FR 45328). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 2, 1993, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington granted a motion by the plaintiffs
in

to compel a proposed designation of critical habitat. In the ruling, the court ordered the Secretary to propose designating
critical habitat for the marbled murrelet no later than January 21, 1994, and to make a final designation of critical
habitat as soon as reasonably possible under applicable law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Marbled murrelets spend the majority of their lives at sea, where they feed primarily on small fish and invertebrates
in near-shore marine waters. Marbled murrelets nest inland, predominately in older, large-limbed trees in dense
forest. Marbled murrelets have been found occasionally on rivers and inland lakes (Carter and Sealy 1986). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The marbled murrelet is a social species that is semi-colonial around the breeding site. Two nests discovered in Washington
during 1990 were located within 46 meters (150 feet) of each other (Hamer and Cummins 1990), and detections of marbled
murrelets exhibiting behaviors associated with nesting activity are often aggregated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nesting occurs over an extended period from early April to late September (Carter and Sealy 1987). Marbled murrelets
have been observed at some inland sites during all months of the year (Paton 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1987, Naslund 1993). During the breeding period, adult marbled murrelets lay a single egg in a tree containing structures
suitable for nesting (e.g., limbs at least 13 centimeters (cm) (5 inches) in diameter, mistletoe infections, witches
brooms, deformities). Both sexes incubate the egg in alternating 24-hour shifts for approximately 30 days, and the
young fledge after an additional 28 days (Simons 1980, Hirsch 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1991). Inland flights by adults feeding young are made from ocean feeding areas to nest sites at all times of the day,
but most often at dusk and dawn (Hamer and Cummins 1991). Chicks are fed at least once a day. The adults carry only one
fish at a time to the young (Carter and Sealy 1987; Hamer and Cummins 1991; Singer

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992). The young are altricial, but remain in the nest longer than young of most other alcids. Before leaving the nest,
the young molt into a distinctive juvenile plumage. Fledglings fly directly from the nest to the sea rather than exploring
the forest environment first (Hamer and Cummins 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purpose of proposing critical habitat, the Service has concentrated on two components of marbled murrelet
habitat: (1) Nesting habitat; and (2) habitat needed to support foraging. Forest stands with conditions that will
support nesting marbled murrelets are referred to as ``suitable nesting habitat.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Throughout the forested portion of the species' range, marbled murrelets nest near the marine environment in forest
stands containing characteristics of older forests (Binford

1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically, nesting habitat for the marbled murrelet was widely dispersed, particularly in the wetter portions
of its range in Washington, Oregon, and California. This habitat was generally found in very large, contiguous blocks.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the threatened population of marbled murrelets nests in most of the major types of coniferous forests
in the western portions of Washington, Oregon, and north-central California, wherever older forests remain in close
proximity to the coast. Habitat in the drier parts of the listed species' range (portions of southern Oregon and northern
California) is less continuous, occurring naturally in a mosaic pattern. Although marbled murrelet nesting habitat
is somewhat variable over the range of the species, some general habitat attributes are common throughout its range,
including nesting structure, canopy closure, stand size, tree species, landscape condition, and distance from
the marine environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual tree attributes that provide conditions suitable for nesting include branches at least 13 cm (5 inches)
in diameter, deformities (e.g., broken tops), mistletoe infections, witches brooms, or other structures providing
a platform for nesting (Carter and Sealy 1987; Hamer and Cummins 1990, 1991; Singer

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993). These structures are typically found in old-growth and mature stands, but may be found in a variety of stand
types including younger stands containing remnant large trees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sixty-one tree nests have been located in North America, including 35 in the range of the listed population (6 in Washington,
20 in Oregon, and 9 in California) (Binford 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

1991, 1992; Nelson unpubl. data). All nests in Washington, Oregon, and California were located in old-growth trees
that were greater than 81 cm (32 inches) diameter at breast height (dbh). Most nests have been located on large or deformed
branches with a moss covering; however, a few nests have been located on smaller branches, and some nests were situated
on conifer needles or sticks rather than moss.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Canopy closure over the nest site provides protection from predation and weather. Such canopy closure may be provided
by trees adjacent to the nest tree and/or by the nest tree itself. Nests are typically located high above ground and
usually have good overhead protection. Such locations allow easy access and provide shelter from potential predators
and weather. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although a few nests have been located in relatively small stands, most nests have been found in larger stands with
sufficient internal structure to minimize the risk of predation at the nest (i.e., minimize habitat for species known
to prey on marbled murrelets) and provide suitable climatic conditions for nesting (Nelson 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992). Marbled murrelets are more commonly encountered in larger stands of older forests in California (greater
than 202 hectares (500 acres)) than in smaller stands (less than 40 hectares (100 acres)). However, marbled murrelets
have been detected in smaller isolated stands in Oregon, with one confirmed nest in a 3-hectare (8-acre) stand (Nelson
unpubl. data). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General landscape condition also may affect use of suitable nesting habitat. In Washington, marbled murrelet detections
increased when old-growth/mature forests comprised over 30 percent of the landscape. Hamer and Cummins (1990) found
that detections of marbled murrelets decreased in Washington when the percent of clearcut/meadow on the landscape
increased above 25 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nests have been located in stands dominated by coastal redwood (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sequoia sempervirens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

 in prep). The nests themselves have been located in Douglas-fir, coastal redwood, western hemlock, western red-cedar,
and Sitka spruce trees. These species of trees have growth forms that produce nesting opportunities and are susceptible
to damage (disease, breakage, wind damage) that may produce nesting structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat units should occur at a distance from the marine environment consistent with the flight and energetic
capabilities of marbled murrelets. The farthest inland known occupied site is 84 kilometers (52 miles) in Washington.
The farthest inland known detections in Oregon and California are 61 and 56 kilometers (38 and 35 miles), respectively.
Occupied sites are defined as forest stands where marbled murrelets have been observed exhibiting behaviors indicative
of likely nesting activity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Northwestern forests typically require 200 to 250 years to attain the attributes necessary to support marbled murrelet
nesting, though characteristics of nesting habitat are sometimes developed in younger redwood forests. Forests
with old-age remnant trees remaining from earlier stands may also develop into nesting habitat more quickly than
those without. These remnant attributes are products of fire, wind storms, or previous logging operations that did
not remove all of the trees. Other factors that may affect the time required to develop suitable nesting characteristics
include site productivity and aspects of the site microclimate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is difficult to locate actual nests for a species such as the marbled murrelet, which may only show activity near
the nest once per day and under low light conditions. Therefore, identification of occupied sites and suitable habitat
are the best indicators of potential nest sites. Active nests, egg shell fragments, or young found on the forest floor,
birds seen flying through the forest beneath the canopy or landing in trees, birds seen circling above the canopy,
birds heard calling from a stationary perch, or large numbers of birds heard calling from within and around a stand
are all strong indicators of occupied habitat. Their semi-colonial nature makes marbled murrelets easier to detect
at high-use sites, though some areas (e.g., highly fragmented habitat with small stand size) support low numbers
of reproducing pairs, making detection difficult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Breeding populations of marbled murrelets are not distributed continuously throughout the species' range. In California,
there are three separate areas where marbled murrelets concentrate at sea, corresponding to the three largest remaining
blocks of coastal old-growth forest inland. These are separated by areas of little or no habitat where few marbled
murrelets are found at sea. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A large break in the breeding distribution is located at the southern portion of the range in California, where approximately
480 kilometers (300 miles) separate the southern breeding population in San Mateo County from the next known occupied
site to the north in Humboldt County. This reach contained marbled murrelets prior to extensive logging in the area
(Paton and Ralph 1988). Another distribution gap is located between Tillamook County in Oregon and the Olympic Peninsula
in Washington, where few birds and occupied sites are known. The degree of interaction that occurs across these gaps

Very little habitat remains at low elevations in the Puget Trough area of Washington. Lands surrounding the Puget
Trough, particularly to the east and south, are highly urbanized or developed for agricultural use, forcing marbled
murrelets to fly up to 25 miles inland to reach the first available suitable nesting habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although marbled murrelets have been heard and/or seen at some inland sites during most months of the year (Paton 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1987, Naslund 1993), detectability at inland sites increases during the spring and reaches a peak late in summer coincident
with the peak in breeding activity (Paton and Ralph 1988, Nelson 1989). In early fall, the number of inland detections
decreases markedly, presumably because birds have completed breeding and are undergoing a flightless molt at sea.
It is unknown why marbled murrelets visit inland sites during the non-breeding season. Researchers hypothesize
that birds attending these areas in fall and winter may be experienced resident birds and that these visits may aid
in maintaining nest sites, nesting territories, and pair bonds (Naslund 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marbled murrelets are currently experiencing very low recruitment rates. Juvenile to adult ratios of marbled murrelets
are between 0.012 and 0.035 (i.e., there are between 1 and 4 juvenile fledglings of that year observed for every 100
adults observed) (Strong 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993). These results are supported by survey data collected at points along the central coast of Oregon during 1988,
1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992. The average percentage of juveniles in these counts were approximately 1, 4, 2, 5, and 1
percent, respectively (Nelson and Hardin in prep.). Surveys conducted in California have indicated similar juvenile
to adult ratios since 1989 (Ralph, U.S. Forest Service, Redwood Sciences Lab, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pers. comm.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). If the juvenile to adult ratios observed in the marine environment are accurate, then only 1 to 5 percent of the
observed population is successfully reproducing, that is, successfully fledging young. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Average annual adult survival for stable populations of several other alcid species is approximately 90 percent
(Hudson 1985). Alcids typically experience their highest rates of mortality prior to the attainment of breeding
age. The average survival to breeding age for alcids is 29 percent (Hudson 1985). The combination of low fledging rates
of marbled murrelets, as demonstrated by the juvenile to adult ratios, and low survival to breeding age are likely
to produce recruitment rates far below those required to maintain present population levels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the longevity of other alcids (Hudson 1985), marbled murrelets are estimated to live an average of 10 years.
With such long-lived species, recruitment rates are a more accurate indicator of species condition than population
counts. At-sea counts of adult marbled murrelets may reflect a large portion of non-breeders that will not contribute
to the future population. If the current low recruitment rates are the result of recent losses of nesting opportunities,
counts of adults may not reflect the sustainable population until the population adjusts to remaining nesting habitat.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another possible explanation for the low juvenile to adult ratios is that individuals are attempting to reproduce,
but the young of these birds are experiencing high mortality rates prior to reaching the ocean. Predation at marbled
murrelet nest sites may have significant impacts on the population. Predation by corvids (common crows (

Bubo virginianus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accipiter striatus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) have been identified as causes of marbled murrelet nest failure. From 1974 through 1991, approximately 71 percent
of all known marbled murrelet nests in the Pacific Northwest failed; 70 percent of these failed due to predation by
these species (Nelson

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corvids are often considered ``edge species'' that have been found to increase in numbers with increased forest fragmentation
(Andren 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1985, Wilcove 1985, Small and Hunter 1988). Similar findings have been reported in central Oregon regarding great
horned owls (Johnson 1993). In addition, corvid predation on small bird nests is known to increase with increased
forest fragmentation and/or decreased distance of nests from a forest edge (Gates and Gysel 1978, Andren 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1985, Small and Hunter 1988, Yahner and Scott 1988). The marbled murrelet's main defense against predation is camouflage.
The ability to successfully hide from arboreal predators is likely related to the number of nesting (or hiding) opportunities
available. Timber harvest reduces the number of nesting opportunities through the removal of nesting habitat within
the landscape, thus reducing the area predators must search. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to effects on marbled murrelet nesting habitat, the species is affected by impacts and threats to their
marine foraging habitat and food supply, as well as direct mortality from human activities such as oil spills and gill
netting. Attributes of foraging habitat include distance from shore, prey populations, and potential disturbances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marbled murrelets are typically distributed in the marine environment in a manner that roughly corresponds to the
location of concentrations of inland nesting habitat. Marbled murrelets generally forage in near-shore marine
waters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marine systems producing sufficient prey to support a stable or growing population of marbled murrelets are important
foraging habitat for the species. Marbled murrelets have been reported feeding on a variety of small fish and invertebrates,
including Pacific herring (

and mysids (Sealy 1975, Sanger and Jones 1981, Sanger 1987, Carter and Sealy 1990, Strong

 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mortality in the marine environment, primarily associated with oil spills and net fisheries in Washington, adversely
affects marbled murrelets. The impact of this loss is generally thought to be less than impacts to nesting habitat.
Protection of foraging areas from disturbance such as oil spills, net fisheries, and pollution would benefit marbled
murrelets.

Management Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Marbled murrelets are found in forest stands containing a variety of forest structures, which are, in part, the result
of varied management practices. In many areas, management practices have resulted in fragmentation of the remaining
older forests and creation of large areas of younger forests that have yet to develop habitat characteristics suitable
for marbled murrelet nesting. Past forest management practices have also resulted in a forest age distribution unnaturally
skewed toward younger-aged stands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many portions of the range of the marbled murrelet, forest management has historically concentrated on clearcut
logging. After forests are clearcut, the areas are traditionally replanted to a single or few tree species and maintained
as even-aged stands for maximum wood-fiber production. Site-preparation and management activities may further
decrease species diversity. These methods include prescribed burning and the use of herbicides or mechanical methods
to control competing vegetation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historical logging practices in some portions of the species' range consisted of more selective timber harvesting,
leaving remnant patches of forests of varying ages with older forest characteristics. The uneven-age management
practices used in these areas usually resulted in more diverse stands, but with few trees containing suitable marbled
murrelet nesting structure. These areas may contain low concentrations of reproducing marbled murrelets, which
are difficult to locate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current and historic marbled murrelet habitat loss is generally attributed to timber harvest and land conversion
practices, although natural disturbances such as forest fires have caused losses as well. Reduction of the remaining
older forest has not been evenly distributed over western Washington, Oregon, and California. Harvest has been concentrated
at the lower elevations and in the Coast Ranges (Thomas

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Habitat for marbled murrelets has been declining since the arrival of European settlers. Information specific to
the range of the marbled murrelet is not available; however, historic forest condition has been estimated for western
Oregon and Washington by several authors. Because marbled murrelet habitat represents a significant portion of
area included in these estimates, trends in habitat are assumed to follow the same general pattern. Although the extent
of mature and old-growth forest before the 1800s is difficult to quantify, western Oregon and Washington are estimated
to have been covered by approximately 9.7 to 11.3 million hectares (24 to 28 million acres) of forest at the time of modern
settlement (early to mid-1800s), of which about 70 percent (5.6 to 7.7 million hectares (14 to 19 million acres)) are
estimated to have been old-growth (Society of American Foresters Task Force 1983, Morrison 1988, Norse 1988, Spies
and Franklin 1988). Historical estimates for northwestern California are not as precise but suggest there were between
526,000 and 1.3 million hectares (1.3 and 3.2 million acres) of old-growth Douglas-fir/mixed conifer forest and
approximately 890,000 hectares (2.2 million acres) of old-growth coastal redwood forest (Society of American Foresters
Task Force 1983, Laudenslayer 1985, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection 1988, Fox 1988, Morrison
1988). Currently, there are approximately 1.4 million hectares (3.4 million acres) of old-growth forest remaining
in western Oregon and Washington, an 82 percent reduction from estimated prelogging levels (Booth 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the old-growth areas that have been affected by past natural perturbations such as forest fire and windthrow
currently provide suitable nesting habitat for marbled murrelets. Mature forests that have naturally regenerated
from such perturbations often retain scattered old-growth trees and clumps, providing structure for nesting. This
is particularly true in coastal Oregon where there were extensive fires historically. Marbled murrelet nests have
been found in remnant old-growth trees in mature forests in Oregon; no occupied sites have been located in young stands,
clearcuts, or young forests that lack at least some remnant old-growth trees (Nelson 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pers. comm. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forests generally require 200 to 250 years to develop old-growth characteristics that supply adequate structure
for nesting marbled murrelets. This time period may be shorter in redwood forests and in areas where significant remnants
of the previous stand remain. Intensively managed forests in Washington, Oregon, and California have been subjected
to average cutting rotations of 70 to 120 years (USDI 1984, USDA 1988). Cutting rotations of 40 to 50 years are common
for some private lands. Timber harvest strategies on Federal lands and some private lands have emphasized dispersed
clearcut patches and even-aged management. Thus, forest lands that are intensively managed for timber production
are generally not allowed to develop the old-growth characteristics that are required for marbled murrelet nesting.
Suitable nesting habitat that remains under these harvest patterns is highly fragmented.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the listing of the marbled murrelet in Washington, Oregon, and California as threatened, several different
approaches to management of the species or its habitat have been developed through various Federal efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In May 1991, the U.S. House of Representatives' Agriculture and Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committees commissioned
the Scientific Panel on Late-Successional Forest Ecosystems (Scientific Panel) to provide an array of alternatives
for the management of late-successional forests on Federal lands within the range of the northern spotted owl (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Strix occidentalis caurina
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Information on the known inland locations of marbled murrelets and marbled murrelet habitat was included in the
base information used by the Scientific Panel and was specifically considered in developing the alternatives. These
reserve systems are often referred to as Late-Successional/Old-Growth areas (LSOGs). The Scientific Panel conducted
risk assessments for marbled murrelets under each alternative (Johnson

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1993, the Forest Service released its Scientific Analysis Team Report (Thomas 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993). In this report, the Forest Service proposed several interim measures designed to preserve options for management
of marbled murrelets and their habitat until the Marbled Murrelet Recovery Plan could be completed and implemented.
These measures include: (1) The protection of all marbled murrelet nesting habitat within 35 miles of the marine environment
in California and Oregon south of State Highway 42, and within 50 miles of the marine environment in the remainder of
Oregon and in Washington; and, (2) the protection of amounts of ``recruitment'' habitat (young stands likely to develop
into suitable habitat) equivalent to 50 percent of the total amount of existing suitable habitat in the above mentioned
zones. Also, seasonal restrictions on operations in and near suitable habitat were identified to avoid disturbing
nesting marbled murrelets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In July 1993, the Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, National
Marine Fisheries Service, and Environmental Protection Agency released the Report of the Forest Ecosystem Management
Assessment Team (FEMAT Report) (USDA

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993a). From this report, the President identified Option 9 as the Proposed Northwest Forest Plan, described in the
Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement on Management of Habitat for Late-Successional and Old-Growth
Forest Related Species Within the Range of the Northern Spotted Owl (DSEIS) as Alternative 9 (Alternative 9) (USDA

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993b). Within the range of the marbled murrelet, Alternative 9 would designate a system of Late-Successional Reserves,
which provides large areas expected to eventually develop into contiguous, unfragmented forest. This reserve system
was constructed in part around the LSOGs designated by the Scientific Panel. In addition, specific measures were
included to protect all forest sites occupied by marbled murrelets outside the reserve system. These measures include
surveys prior to activities that affect habitat and protection of contiguous marbled murrelet nesting and recruitment
habitat (stands capable of becoming suitable within 25 years) within 0.5 mile of areas occupied by murrelets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service recognizes the value of the Proposed Northwest Forest Plan (USDA

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993a) and acknowledges that it can play an integral role in marbled murrelet conservation. The Plan complements
this critical habitat proposal by stressing the need for protection of large, unfragmented areas of suitable nesting
habitat that are well-distributed throughout the species' range, with special emphasis on areas close to the marine
environment.

Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Definition of Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the Act as: ``(i) the specific areas within the geographical area
occupied by the species&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential
to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations or protection; and
(ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*
upon a determination&blank;*&blank;*&blank;* that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.''
The term ``conservation,'' as defined in section 3(3) of the Act, means ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;to use and the
use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring any endangered species or threatened species to the
point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.''

Role in Species Conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat indicates that its designation should
identify lands that may be needed for a species' eventual recovery and delisting. However, when critical habitat
is designated at the time a species is listed or before a recovery plan is completed, the Service frequently does not
know all the habitat areas that may be essential for a species' recovery. In this regard, critical habitat serves to
preserve options for a species' eventual recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The designation of critical habitat is one of several measures available to contribute to the conservation of a listed
species. Critical habitat helps focus conservation activities by identifying areas that contain essential habitat
features (primary constituent elements), regardless of whether or not they are currently occupied by the listed
species, thus alerting the public to the importance of an area in the species' conservation. Critical habitat also
identifies areas that may require special management or protection. The added emphasis on these areas for conservation
of the species may shorten the time needed to achieve recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat receives consideration under section 7 of the Act with regard to actions carried out, authorized,
or funded by a Federal agency. Federal agencies must ensure that their actions do not result in destruction or adverse
modification of critical habitat. Aside from this added consideration under section 7, the Act does not provide any
additional protection to lands designated as critical habitat. Designating critical habitat does not create a management
plan for the areas, establish numerical population goals or prescribe specific management actions (inside or outside
of critical habitat), or have a direct effect on areas not designated as critical habitat. Specific management recommendations
for critical habitat are addressed in recovery plans, management plans, and in section 7 consultations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A designation of critical habitat begins by identifying areas on which are found the physical and biological features
essential to conservation of a species. In determining which areas to designate as critical habitat, the Service
considers those physical and biological features that are essential to a species' conservation and that may require
special management considerations or protection. Such physical and biological features, as stated in 50 CFR 424.12,
include, but are not limited to, the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

distributions of a species.

The Service is required to base critical habitat designations upon the best scientific data available (50 CFR 424.12).
In proposing to designate critical habitat for the marbled murrelet in Washington, Oregon, and California, the Service
has reviewed its overall approach to the conservation of the species. For a thorough discussion of the ecology and
life history of the marbled murrelet, see the Service's Biological Report (Marshall 1988), the final rule listing
the Washington, Oregon, and California population (57 FR 45328) of this subspecies, and the Ecological Considerations

Within habitat areas essential for marbled murrelet nesting, the Service has focused on the following primary constituent
elements: (1) Individual trees with potential nesting platforms; (2) forest stands surrounding potential nest
trees, including contiguous forest with similar average height and canopy closure; (3) forest stands with high crown
cover and sufficient height to contribute to a forest landscape with decreased fragmentation; and (4) forest stands
within the potential flight distance of marbled murrelets from the marine environment where the birds feed. These
primary constituent elements are essential to provide nesting habitat for the marbled murrelet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individual nest trees include large trees, generally over 81 cm (32 inches) dbh, with the presence of potential nest
platforms or deformities such as large limbs (greater than 13 cm (5 inches)), broken tops, mistletoe infections,
witches brooms, or other formations providing a broad platform. Because marbled murrelets do not build nests, moss
or detritus to cushion or hold the egg may be important. Platforms should have overhead cover for protection from predators
and weather, which may be provided by overhanging branches, limbs above the nest area, or branches from neighboring
trees. Based on current information, Douglas-fir, coastal redwood, western hemlock, western red-cedar, or Sitka
spruce are the trees most likely to provide suitable nesting structure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nesting habitat includes the forest stand in which the nest trees are contained. Nest stands are defined as contiguous
mature and old-growth forest with no separations of greater than 100 meters (330 feet) wide. Nest trees may be scattered
throughout the stand or clumped within portions of the contiguous stand. Nest stands in mature forest may contain
fewer than one old-growth tree per acre. Regardless of the distribution of nest trees, nesting habitat includes the
entire contiguous forest stand with similar height and canopy closure. The forest stand surrounding the nest tree
provides protection from predators and climatic factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On a landscape basis, the presence of late-successional, mature, and old-growth forests with substantial canopy
closure and canopy height of at least one-half the site-potential tree height also contribute to the conservation
of the marbled murrelet, even if they do not contain potential nest trees. The site-potential tree height is the average
maximum height possible for a tree given the local growing conditions. The presence of these forest stands increases
the area predators must search, decreasing predator efficiency. Forests of the general height of the nest stands
and in close proximity to the stand reduce edge-associated predation, effects of changes in microclimate associated
with abrupt edges, and potential for windthrow during storms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be considered as nesting habitat, forest stands must occur at a distance from the marine environment consistent
with the flight and energetic capabilities of the marbled murrelet. Based on confirmed detections of marbled murrelets,
this distance varies from 84 kilometers (52 miles) in Washington to less than 16 kilometers (10 miles) in parts of California.
Flight distances may reflect the energetic capabilities of marbled murrelets and the presence of suitable nesting
habitat.

The Service is not proposing to designate marine areas as critical habitat for the marbled murrelet at this time, but
will continue to collect information on threats, the need for marine critical habitat, and the potential benefits
of designating marine critical habitat.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Criteria for Identifying Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several qualitative criteria were considered in the selection of specific areas as critical habitat. These criteria
are generally similar to criteria used in the development of several recent Federal management proposals, such as
the report prepared by the Scientific Panel (Johnson 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1991) and Alternative 9 (USDA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1993a). The following is a description of the criteria considered: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Known Occupied Sites: Proposed critical habitat units include the majority of the known sites occupied by marbled
murrelets on Federal lands. However, known occupied sites may represent only a small portion of the population due
to the limited coverage of past survey efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suitable Nesting Habitat: Proposed critical habitat units include areas with current suitable nesting habitat
and other primary constituent elements. Approximately 48 percent of the suitable nesting habitat on Federal lands
within the range of the species in Washington, Oregon, and California is included in proposed critical habitat. Forests
that are not currently suitable, but which are of similar average height and canopy closure, are also important in
improving habitat conditions through reduced fragmentation and creation of large contiguous forest stands that
reduce the potential for predation. The total amount of land containing the other primary constituent elements is
currently unknown. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distance from Marine Environment: Marbled murrelets forage daily in the marine environment during the nesting season.
To allow for foraging opportunities, nesting habitat must be within the flight capabilities and energetic limits
of the species. Proposed critical habitat units were selected based on the distance inland of detections in each general
area. As stated above, detections range from over 50 miles from the marine environment in Washington to less than 10
miles in some portions of California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rangewide Distribution: To reduce the impact of catastrophic losses of habitat or birds and maintain the current
distribution of the species, proposed critical habitat units were selected throughout the range of the listed population,
where Federal lands were available. With well-distributed critical habitat, the probability of substantial population
declines resulting from catastrophic wildfires or storm events is reduced. Maintaining nesting habitat, and therefore
local concentrations, throughout the range of the species will reduce potential losses from oil spills or other marine
events. Given the intense site fidelity of most alcid species, maintaining rangewide distribution may also provide
potential source populations for the recolonization of future habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large, Contiguous Blocks of Habitat: In response to the problems of fragmentation of suitable habitat, potential
increases in predation, and reduced reproductive success, the Service concentrated on selecting proposed critical
habitat units in terms of large, contiguous blocks of late-successional, mature, and old-growth forest. To provide
large blocks of habitat, the Service concentrated on the Late-Successional Reserve system identified in Alternative
9. Marbled murrelet locations and habitat were considered in the development of these reserves. Where large blocks
of Federal reserve areas were not available, but where critical habitat was determined to be important for distribution,
smaller Federal reserves were included. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adequacy of Existing Protection and Management: The Service considered the existing legal status of lands in the
decision to propose specific areas as critical habitat. Areas with permanent legal protection, such as congressionally-designated
wilderness areas, national parks, and national wildlife refuges, are not proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Results of Applying Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Application of the selection criteria resulted in the proposed designation of many of the Late-Successional Reserves,
as described in Alternative 9, on Federal lands within the range of the marbled murrelet in Washington, Oregon, and
California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, only Federal lands are proposed for designation. However, the Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment
Team recognized the limited ability of Federal agencies to recover this species on Federal lands. ``Although the
Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment was designed to address only Federal lands within the range of the northern
spotted owl, the marbled murrelet is an example of a species whose life history requirements cannot be accommodated
only on Federal lands. The marbled murrelet is a seabird that nests inland and therefore is influenced by both the marine
and terrestrial environments. Its nesting range in the three-state area includes land that is south of the range of
the northern spotted owl. In addition, several areas that are considered key to the recovery of the marbled murrelet
involve private and State lands'' (FEMAT Report at IV&hyph;151 and IV&hyph;152, USDA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993a). For example, the southernmost portion of the range of the marbled murrelet in California, southwest Washington,
and northwest Oregon contain little or no Federal lands or habitat capable of supporting marbled murrelets. The Service
currently lacks sufficient information to fully identify any specific non-Federal lands essential to the conservation
of the species in these and other areas. The Service will continue to gather information on non-Federal land contributions
to conservation and through this notice is requesting comments on this subject. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Lands Not Proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Not all suitable nesting habitat is included within the proposed critical habitat units. Emphasis has been placed
on those areas considered most essential to the species in terms of habitat, distribution, and ownership. That does
not mean that lands outside critical habitat are not important to the marbled murrelet. Some Federal lands outside
of critical habitat are expected to receive additional protection from the conservation measures proposed in Alternative
9. Some habitat on non-Federal lands receives protection through prohibitions against take of marbled murrelets.

Congressionally-protected Areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because they are generally managed as natural ecosystems, congressionally-designated wilderness areas and national
parks are expected to protect marbled murrelet habitat from alteration. These areas are not proposed for designation
as critical habitat because the management goals are generally adequate to conserve the species. However, not all
congressional designations are managed in this manner. For example, national recreation areas may not be managed
to maintain older forest habitats. In addition, some national parks and wilderness areas are experiencing internal
and external threats (e.g., highway realignments) to marbled murrelet habitat. The Service is continuing to gather
information on management goals and potential threats to these types of areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congressionally-protected areas (e.g., wilderness areas and national parks) are rare within the range of the marbled
murrelet in Washington, Oregon, and California. Few wilderness areas lie within the flight distance of marbled murrelets
from the marine environment, though some of these areas provide crucial contributions to the conservation of the
species. A substantial portion of these areas are incapable of producing marbled murrelet nesting habitat because
of forest composition, lack of forest cover, elevation, and other constraints. Therefore, by themselves, congressionally-protected
areas are incapable of supporting stable and interactive populations of marbled murrelets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wilderness areas and national parks contain approximately 302,000 hectares (747,000 acres) of marbled murrelet
nesting habitat, representing 29 percent of the suitable nesting habitat on Federal lands within the range of the
marbled murrelet. They contain 46 (8 percent) of the known occupied sites on Federal lands.

Effects of Proposed Designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal for designation of critical habitat for the marbled murrelet identifies 62 proposed critical habitat
units encompassing approximately 1,217,000 hectares (3,005,000 acres) of Federal land based on information available
in the Interagency Geographical Information System (GIS) and FEMAT Report (USDA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993a). The Service has identified 28 proposed critical habitat units totaling 471,000 hectares (1,162,000 acres)
of Federal land in Washington, 20 proposed critical habitat units totaling 560,000 hectares (1,382,000 acres) of
Federal land in Oregon, and 14 proposed critical habitat units totaling 186,000 hectares (460,000 acres) of Federal
land in California. State, private, tribal, and other non-Federal lands are not proposed as critical habitat at this
time even if they are physically located within the boundaries of a proposed critical habitat unit, and acreage of
non-Federal lands is not included in the above figures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some small areas of naturally-occurring or human-created non-suitable habitat (i.e., areas that have never been
nor will likely ever be marbled murrelet nesting habitat, such as alpine areas, water bodies, serpentine meadows,
airports, roads, buildings, and parking lots) are located within the physical boundaries of proposed critical habitat
units. Where possible, these areas were not included within the proposed critical habitat boundaries, and acreage
totals were adjusted to reflect the exclusion of this non-suitable habitat. However, many of these areas are small
and could not be physically identified on the GIS maps. Also, current mapping information does not allow precise identification
of the location of primary constituent elements. The Service is continuing to gather information to refine the boundaries
of critical habitat units to eliminate areas that do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements or
will remain non-suitable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efforts by Federal agencies to survey for marbled murrelets have been concentrated in areas of proposed timber sales
or limited research locations. Only a small fraction of the suitable nesting habitat has been surveyed to date, and
surveys have not been uniformly spread across the range of the species. Therefore, known occupied sites provide only
a partial indication of the actual areas used by the species. The proposed critical habitat includes 449 (78 percent)
of the 574 known occupied sites on Federal lands. Congressionally-protected areas include 48 additional occupied
sites. Congressionally-protected areas were not included in critical habitat because management is expected to
be consistent with the conservation of the marbled murrelet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service does not have specific information on the amount of suitable nesting habitat or habitat containing one
or more of the primary constituent elements on non-Federal lands within the species' range, though it is aware through
the Forest Ecosystem Management Assessment Team databases of approximately 189 known occupied sites on non-Federal
lands. The Service continues to seek information and comments on the location of suitable nesting habitat and occupied
sites on non-Federal lands.

Designation of critical habitat would not offer specific direction for managing marbled murrelet nesting habitat
nor provide a management or conservation plan for the species. Recovery plans typically provide guidance for conservation,
which may include population goals and the identification of areas that may need protection or special management.
Recovery plans usually include management recommendations for designated critical habitat. In February 1993,
the Service appointed a recovery team to develop a recovery plan for the marbled murrelet. The team plans to have a draft
recovery plan available in the spring of 1994. The Service will continue to work closely with the recovery team and
will reexamine proposed critical habitat in light of recovery team recommendations.

Section 7_Consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out
are not likely to destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat. This Federal responsibility accompanies,
and is in addition to, the requirement in section 7(a)(2) of the Act that Federal agencies ensure that their actions
are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species. A Federal agency must consult with the
Service if its proposed action may affect a listed species or critical habitat. Regulations implementing this interagency
cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as ``*&blank;*&blank;* a direct
or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the survival and recovery
of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations adversely modifying any of those
physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical.'' The jeopardy concept
is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as any action that would be expected to reduce appreciably the likelihood of both the survival
and recovery of a species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Survival and recovery, mentioned in both the definition of adverse modification and jeopardy, are directly related.
Survival may be viewed as a linear continuum between recovery and extinction of the species. The closer one is to recovery,
the greater the certainty in the species' continued survival. The terms survival and recovery are thus related by
the degree of certainty that the species will persist over a given period of time. Factors that influence a species'
persistence include population numbers, distribution throughout its range, stochasticity, expected duration,
and reproductive success. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act's definition of critical habitat indicates that the purpose of critical habitat is to contribute to a species'
conservation. Section 7 prohibitions against the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat apply
to actions that would impair survival and recovery of the listed species, thus providing a regulatory means of ensuring
that Federal actions within critical habitat are considered in relation to the goals and recommendations of a recovery
plan. As a result of the link between critical habitat and recovery in the Act's definition of critical habitat, the
prohibition against destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat should provide for the protection
of the critical habitat's ability to contribute to the recovery of the species. Thus, the adverse modification standard
may be reached closer to the recovery end of the survival continuum, whereas, the jeopardy standard has been applied
nearer to the extinction end of the continuum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a proposal of critical habitat, section 7(a)(4) of the Act and implementing regulations (50 CFR 402.10) require
Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any action that is likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification
of the proposed critical habitat. Conference reports provide advisory conservation recommendations to assist
a Federal agency in identifying and resolving conflicts that may be caused by the proposed action.

If an agency requests, and the Service concurs, a formal conference report may be issued. A formal conference report
on proposed critical habitat contains an opinion that is prepared in accordance with 50 CFR 402.14 as if the critical
habitat were designated, not proposed. Such a formal conference report may be adopted as the biological opinion pursuant
to 50 CFR 402.10(d) when the critical habitat is designated, if no significant new information has been brought forward
and no changes in the action occur that would alter the content of the opinion.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(8) of the Act requires, for any proposed or final regulation that designates critical habitat, a brief
description and evaluation of those activities (public or private) that may adversely modify such habitat or may
be affected by such designation. As stated earlier, regulations found at 50 CFR 402.02 define destruction or adverse
modification of critical habitat as a direct or indirect alteration that appreciably diminishes the value of critical
habitat for both the survival and recovery of a listed species. Such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations
adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that were the basis for determining the habitat
to be critical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A wide variety of existing and proposed activities may alter or affect proposed marbled murrelet critical habitat.
Examples of such activities include, but are not limited to timber harvest, forest management, salvage activities,
limbing or modification of limb structure (e.g., for hazard management), mining and mineral exploration, construction
of hydroelectric facilities, road construction and refurbishing, and development. Activities that do not alter
forest condition, such as some recreational use and personal-use commodity production (e.g., noncommercial mushroom
picking, Christmas tree cutting, rock collection) are unlikely to be affected by the proposed designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Activities conducted according to the standards and guidelines for Late-Successional Reserves, as described in
Alternative 9 of the DSEIS for the Proposed Northwest Forest Plan would, in most cases, be unlikely to result in the
destruction or adverse modification of proposed marbled murrelet critical habitat. Activities in these areas would
be limited to manipulation of young forest stands that are not currently marbled murrelet nesting habitat. Also,
these manipulations would be conducted in a manner that would not slow the development of these areas into future nesting
habitat and should speed the development of some characteristics of older forest.

Economic and Other Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific data available and to
consider the economic and other relevant impacts of specifying any particular area as critical habitat. The Secretary
may exclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh the benefits
of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat, unless he determines, based on the best scientific and commercial
data available, that the failure to designate such area as critical habitat will result in the extinction of the species
concerned. The Act thus requires the Service to evaluate the economic and other effects likely to result from a designation
of critical habitat. Effects attributable to the listing of the species, normal changes in affected industries,
or changes in Federal land management that are not caused by the designation are not regarded as effects of the designation
of critical habitat. However, due to the complex interplay of economic and other forces, separating impacts associated
solely with the designation of critical habitat from other impacts is often difficult.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed critical habitat units for the marbled murrelet coincide with the location of many of the Late-Successional
Reserves as described in Option 9 of the FEMAT Report (USDA 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

1993b). Alternative 9 is identified as the preferred alternative in the DSEIS for the Proposed Northwest Forest Plan.
Based on the description of standards for management of and limitations on impacts to marbled murrelet habitat within
the Late-Successional Reserves, management of the Reserves under Alternative 9 would be consistent with designating
them as critical habitat for the marbled murrelet. Therefore, the economic effects of the designation of Late-Successional
Reserves as critical habitat are not likely to exceed those described in the economic analysis of the FEMAT Report

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has preliminarily reviewed the possible economic impacts of designating critical habitat for the marbled
murrelet on ongoing timber activities. Both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are currently under
court injunctions prohibiting the offering of any new sales until the agencies comply with the National Environmental
Policy Act and various forest management legislation. The Proposed Northwest Forest Plan will be presented to the
court by April 1994 in an attempt to resolve the court's concerns. Pending that court decision, the only timber available
to the timber industry from Federal lands are sold and awarded sales, particularly sales offered under the protection
of Section 318. Therefore, the Service proposes to exclude sold and awarded sales from any final critical habitat
designation due to economic impacts, both regionally and nationally, due to the limited amount of volume available
for Federal harvest. Comments are requested from the public on this aspect of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The time constraints governing this proposed critical habitat designation did not allow for a more detailed evaluation
on the particular areas proposed. Following receipt of comments and information during the public comment period,
the Service will conduct additional economic analyses if needed. The Service will further evaluate the economic
and other relevant impacts of including or excluding particular areas from a designation of marbled murrelet critical
habitat.

The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment, as defined under the authority of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in conjunction with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Act.
A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The Department of the Interior has determined that
the proposed rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on the information discussed in this rule concerning public projects and private activities within proposed
critical habitat units, it is not clear at this time whether significant economic impacts will result from critical
habitat designation. Also, no direct costs, enforcement costs, information collection, or recordkeeping requirements
are imposed on small entities by this designation. Further, the rule contains no recordkeeping requirements as defined
by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

The Service has analyzed the potential takings implications of designating critical habitat for the marbled murrelet
in a Takings Implications Assessment prepared pursuant to requirements of Executive Order 12630, ``Governmental
Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.'' The Takings Implications Assessment
concludes that critical habitat designation, as proposed, would not pose significant takings implications.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.), requires that
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species
presents substantial scientific or commercial information to demonstrate that the petitioned action may be warranted.
This finding is to be based on all information available to the Service at the time. To the maximum extent practicable,
this finding is to be made within 90 days of the receipt of the petition, and the finding is to be published promptly in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If the finding is positive, the Service also is required to promptly commence a review of the status of the involved
species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has made a 90-day finding on a petition to list 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pinus albicaulis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (whitebark pine). The petition, dated February 5, 1991, was submitted by the Great Bear Foundation, Missoula, Montana,
and was received by the Service on February 11, 1991. The petitioners requested that the Service list the whitebark
pine as endangered in western Montana, northern Idaho, western Wyoming, and northeastern Washington, and as either
threatened or endangered in the Cascade region of Oregon and Washington, and that critical habitat be designated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Act, the Service is required to address the status of plant species over their entire range (unlike vertebrate
species where distinct population segments may be listed). Therefore, the Service views the petition as a petition
to list the whitebark pine throughout its range, which extends from central California to western Wyoming, north
through Oregon, Washington, and Montana to Alberta and British Columbia.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner submitted information and literature references on the status of the whitebark pine, stating that
in significant portions of the species' range, populations are declining so rapidly that the ability of the tree species
to regenerate itself is in question. The petition identifies three major factors involved in the ``precipitous''
decline of the whitebark pine: white pine blister rust (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Cronartium ribicola
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), mountain pine beetle (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dendroctonus ponderosae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and fire suppression. The petition indicates that white pine blister rust, an introduced disease, has become established
throughout most of the whitebark pine's range with ``extensive'' infestation and mortality occurring in the moist
mountain regions of Montana, northern Idaho, Oregon, and the Washington Cascades. The petition also states that
mountain pine beetle infestations have had devastating effects on whitebark pine populations in Montana and Wyoming.
The petitioner also points out that fire suppression has played a role in the population decline by allowing other
tree species to invade whitebark pine habitat and replace it, as well as facilitating the spread of white pine blister
rust and mountain pine beetle infestation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While recent mountain pine beetle infestations have killed most of the mature trees in some areas (Reynolds 1990),
infestations appear to reach epidemic levels only where specific conditions exist. Whitebark pine populations
have been severely reduced by white pine blister rust in many moist mountain habitats where the climate allows the
blister rust to complete its life cycle (Kendall and Arno 1990). However, in drier portions of the whitebark pine's
range, climatic conditions are not favorable for infection, and damage due to white pine blister rust is negligible
(Charles Wellner, retired U.S. Forest Service, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1991). Thus, throughout portions of its range, the whitebark pine remains common in suitable habitats and/or populations
do not appear to be declining (Dr. Clinton Williams, U.S. Forest Service, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1991; Chester Buchanan, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

in litt
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1991; R.T. Ogilvie, Royal British Columbia Museum, pers. comm., 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has reviewed the petition, the literature cited in the petition, other available literature and information,
and has consulted with biologists and researchers familiar with the whitebark pine. After reviewing the best scientific
and commercial information available, the Service finds the petition does not present substantial information
that listing the whitebark pine may be warranted. In making this finding, the Service does recognize that white pine
blister rust, mountain pine beetle infestations, and successional replacement and competition by more shade-tolerant
conifers do pose a real threat to the whitebark pine in portions of its range. Some whitebark pine populations have
undergone dramatic declines due to one or a combination of these factors, and the degree of population decline may
be severe in local or, in some cases, over broad geographic areas. However, in other portions of the species' range,
where different climatic conditions exist, these same factors are not stand-threatening, and healthy whitebark
pine stands continue to persist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whitebark pine is usually restricted to remote, higher elevation areas and generally is not valued as a timber species.
Consequently, little inventory or monitoring work has been completed in much of its range. In many areas, there are
little or no quantitative data on its distribution, status, or the extent of decline due to the various factors mentioned
above. However, available data do not indicate the species may be threatened or endangered throughout a significant
portion of its range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In regard to the petitioner's request that critical habitat be designated for the whitebark pine, the designation
of critical habitat is not a petitionable action under the Act.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The spruce-fir moss spider was originally described by Crosby and Bishop (1925) based on collections made from a site
in western North Carolina in 1923 (Coyle 1981). Only a few specimens were taken, and little was known about the species
until its rediscovery approximately 50 years later by Dr. Frederick Coyle (Western Carolina University, Cullowhee,
North Carolina) and Dr. William Shear (Hampden-Sydney College, Hampden-Sydney, Virginia) (Coyle 1981). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Microhexura montivaga 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is one of only two species belonging to the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Microhexura 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in the family 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dipluridae 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(Coyle 1981; Harp 1991, 1992). The other species in the genus, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. idahoana
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, occurs only in the Pacific Northwest (Coyle 1981). Diplurids belong in the primitive suborder 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mygalomorphae, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
which are often popularly referred to as ``tarantulas'' (Harp 1991, 1992). The genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Microhexura 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is the northernmost representative of the family 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dipluridae 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and is also one of the smallest of the mygalomorph spiders, with adults measuring only 3.0 to 5.6 millimeters (roughly
1/4 to 7/16 inch) (Coyle 1981). Coloration of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
M. montivaga 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ranges from light brown to a darker reddish brown, and there are no markings on the abdomen (Harp 1992). The carapace
is generally yellowish brown (Harp 1992). The most reliable field identification characteristics for the spruce-fir
moss spider are a pair of very long posterior spinnerets and the presence of a second pair of book lungs, which appear
as light patches posterior to the genital furrow (Harp 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The typical habitat of the spruce-fir moss spider is found in well-drained moss (and liverwort) mats growing on rocks
or boulders, in well-shaded situations in mature, high-elevation Fraser fir (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abies fraseri
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and red spruce (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Picea rubens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) forests (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992). The moss mats cannot be too dry (the species is very sensitive to desiccation) or
too wet (large drops of water can also pose a threat to the spider) (Harp 1992). The spider constructs its tube-shaped
webs in the interface between the moss mat and rock surface (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992), though occasionally the web extends
into the interior of the moss mat (Harp 1992). The tubes are thin-walled and typically broad and flattened with short
side branches (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992). There is no record of prey having been found in the webs of the spruce-fir moss
spider nor has the species been observed taking prey in the wild, but the abundant springtails (collembolans) in the
moss mats provide the most likely source of food for the spider (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Males of the species mature during September and October, and females are known to lay eggs in June. The egg sac is thin-walled
and nearly transparent, and it may contain seven to nine eggs. The female remains with the egg sac and, if disturbed,
will carry the egg sac with her fangs. Spiderlings emerge in September (Coyle 1981). The means of dispersal of the spiderlings
from the parental moss mat is not known, but ``ballooning,'' a process by which the spiders use a sheet of silk played
out into the wind to carry them into the air, has been suggested as a possible means of long-range dispersal (Harp 1992).
The life span of the species is also unknown, but Coyle (1981) estimated that it may take 4 years for the species to reach
maturity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From 1989 through 1992, status surveys were conducted for the spruce-fir moss spider (Harp 1991, 1992). Based on the
results of these surveys, the spider is presently known to exist at only four locations_three sites in North Carolina
and one in Tennessee. Of the four remaining populations, only one appears to be relatively stable. This population
is located along the Avery/Caldwell County line in North Carolina. The other two populations in North Carolina are
located in Swain County. Both of these Swain County populations are extremely small, with only one spruce-fir moss
spider having been found at each of these two sites in recent years (Harp 1991, 1992). The spruce-fir forests at these
two Swain County sites are rapidly declining. The Tennessee population is located in Sevier County. This population
was considered healthy in 1989 but is currently believed to be declining in numbers and is endangered by habitat loss/alteration
(Harp 1992). The high-elevation spruce-fir forests throughout much of the species' historic range are being decimated
by the balsam wooly adelgid (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adelges piceae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), an exotic insect pest, and possibly by air pollution (acid precipitation) and other factors not yet fully understood.
The death and thinning of the forest canopy results in locally drastic changes in microclimate, including increased
temperatures and decreased moisture leading to desiccation of the moss mats on which the spruce-fir moss spider,
and possibly its prey base, depend for survival. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The spruce-fir moss spider is not included in the Service's notice of review for animal candidates published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804). However, because of concerns expressed by some individuals for the spider's status,
the Service contracted in 1990 for a survey of both historic and potential habitat of the species. The results of the
survey, which was completed in 1992, indicate that the spider is undergoing a rapid decline in distribution. Presently
only one relatively stable population is known to survive, and while currently considered to be healthy, this population
is potentially threatened by the same factors that are believed to have resulted in the decline and/or extirpation
of the species elsewhere within its historic range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Species appearing in the candidate notices of review are assigned to either category 1, 2 or 3. In conjunction with
the current proposed rule, the Service has approved the spruce-fir moss spider as a category 1 candidate. Category
1 represents those species for which the Service has enough substantial information on biological vulnerability
and threats to support proposals to list them as endangered or threatened species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has met and been in contact with various Federal and State agency personnel and private individuals knowledgeable
about the species concerning its status and the need for the protection provided by the Act. On December 31, 1992, the
Service notified appropriate Federal, State, and local government agencies and landowners, in writing, that a status
review was being conducted and that the species might be proposed for Federal listing. A total of ten written comments
were received. The National Park Service, the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation, and three private
individuals (including the owner of the site containing the Avery/Caldwell County, North Carolina, population)
expressed strong support for the potential listing of the spruce-fir moss spider as an endangered species. The U.S.
Soil Conservation Service, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation,
Tennessee Valley Authority, and the North Carolina Department of Agriculture stated that they had no new or additional
information on the species or threats to its continued existence. No negative comments were received.

) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures
for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to
one or more of the five factors described in Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the spruce-fir

The spruce-fir moss spider is known to be endemic only to high-elevation spruce-fir forests of western North Carolina
and eastern Tennessee. Historically, the species has been reported from four sites in North Carolina and one in Tennessee.
In North Carolina the species has been recorded from two sites in Swain County, one in Yancey County, and one in Avery
and Caldwell Counties (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992). In Tennessee, the species is known from only one site in Sevier County
(Coyle 1981).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During 1989 and through 1992, both historic and potential habitat of the species was surveyed (Harp 1991, 1992). No
new populations of the spruce-fir moss spider were discovered, and of the five previously recorded populations,
only one_the Avery and Caldwell County, North Carolina, population_appears to be stable (Harp 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Yancey County, North Carolina, population appears to have been extirpated, and only a single individual could
be found at each of the two sites in Swain County, North Carolina (Harp 1992). The population in Sevier County, Tennessee,
was surveyed in 1989 and was considered to be relatively healthy at that time (Harp 1991). However, revisits to this
site in 1992 indicated the population level is declining, apparently in conjunction with a rapid decline in the forest
canopy occurring at the site and associated desiccation of moss-mat habitat (Harp 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The spruce-fir moss spider is very sensitive to desiccation and requires situations of high and constant humidity
(Coyle 1981; Harp 1991, 1992). Loss of forest canopy leading to increased light and decreased moisture on the forest
floor (resulting in desiccation of the moss mats) appears to be the major cause for the loss and decline of the spruce-fir
moss spider at all four of these sites and the major threat to the species' continued existence. In a 1991 letter to Keith
Langdon (National Park Service, Great Smoky Mountains National Park), Dr. Frederick Coyle (Western Carolina University)
indicated that the spruce-fir moss spider was common at one of the sites in Swain County, North Carolina, as late as
1983 but was extremely rare by 1988. In his letter to Keith Langdon, Dr. Coyle stated that many of the moss mats at this
site had become dry and loose, which he suspected was due largely to deterioration of the forest canopy at the site.
Fraser firs at all four of these sites (the Swain and Yancey County sites in North Carolina and the Sevier County, Tennessee,
site) have suffered extensive mortality, believed to be primarily due to infestation by the balsam wooly adelgid
(J. Harp, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, personal communication, 1993), a nonnative insect pest believed to have
been introduced into the United States from Europe (Eager 1984). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Atmospheric deposition of pollutants, primarily affecting the red spruce (Harp 1992), may also be a major factor
(either directly or indirectly) in the decline of the forest canopy at these sites. It has been estimated that the red
spruce at the site in Yancey County, North Carolina, where the species is now believed to be extirpated, have lost 75
to 90 percent of their foliage (Krahl-Urban et al. 1988), possibly due to acid precipitation. The death and thinning
of the canopy trees within these stands also cause the remaining trees to be more susceptible to wind and other storm
damage, which has become a major concern at the Sevier County, Tennessee, site (J. Harp, personal communication 1992).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The spruce-fir forest at the site harboring the Avery/Caldwell County, North Carolina, population of the spruce-fir
moss spider has not experienced the degree of decline that has occurred (and is occurring) at the other sites known
to support (or to have supported) populations of the spider. However, the same factors that are believed to have resulted
in the decline of the spruce-fir forest and the associated loss of suitable moss-mat habitat at these other sites potentially
threaten this population and its habitat at this site as well.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The spruce-fir moss spider is not currently known to be commercially valuable; however, because of its extreme rarity
and uniqueness, it is conceivable that it could be sought by collectors. It is one of only two members of the genus Microhexura
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, it is the only representative of the primitive family 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Dipluridae
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in eastern North America, and it is one of the smallest of the world's ``tarantulas.'' While collecting or other intentional
take is not presently identified as a factor contributing to the species' decline, the low numbers, slow reproductive
rate, and extremely restricted range of the spruce-fir moss spider make it unlikely that the species could withstand
even moderate collecting pressure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is presently unknown whether disease or predation have played a role in the decline of the spruce-fir moss spider.
Further research is needed in this area. While predation is not thought to be a significant threat to a healthy population
of the spruce-fir moss spider, it could limit the recovery of the species or contribute to the local extirpation of
populations already depleted by other factors. Possible predators of the spruce-fir moss spider include pseudoscorpions,
centipedes, and other spiders (Harp 1992).

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Neither the State of North Carolina nor the State of Tennessee include arachnids on their lists of endangered and threatened
species; therefore, the species is unprotected in both States. Federal listing would provide protection for the
spruce-fir moss spider throughout its range by requiring Federal permits to take the species and by requiring Federal
agencies to consult with the Service when activities they fund, authorize, or carry out may affect the species.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 -->
E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Only one of the four remaining populations of this species appears stable. The other three surviving populations
are extremely small, and all four populations are geographically isolated from one another. Therefore, the long-term
genetic viability of these populations is in doubt. Also, the restricted range of each of the surviving populations
makes them extremely vulnerable to extirpation from a single event or activity, such as a severe storm, fire, land-clearing
or timbering operation, pesticide/herbicide application, etc. Because they are isolated from one another, natural
repopulation of an extirpated population would be unlikely without human intervention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by this species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the
preferred action is to list the spruce-fir moss spider (Microhexura montivaga
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as an endangered species. The species has been greatly reduced in numbers throughout the majority of its historic
range and presently is known to occur at only four locations. At two of these locations, only lone individuals_one
at each location_have been observed in recent years; at a third location the species has undergone a rapid decline
in numbers and is endangered by further habitat degradation/alteration. Only one of the remaining populations appears
to be stable at this time, and it is potentially threatened by many of the same factors that are believed to have resulted
in the extirpation or decline of the other historically known populations. Due to the species' history of population
loss and decline and the extreme vulnerability of the surviving populations, endangered status appears to be appropriate
for this species. Critical habitat is not being proposed for this species at this time for the reasons discussed below.

Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
propose any habitat of a species that is considered to be critical at the time the species is proposed to be endangered
or threatened. The Service's regulations [50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)] state that designation of critical habitat is not
prudent when one or both of the following situations exist: (1) The species is threatened by taking or other activity
and the identification of critical habitat can be expected to increase the degree of threat to the species or (2) such
designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial to the species. The Service finds that designation of critical
habitat is not prudent for this species. Such a determination would result in no known benefit to the spruce-fir moss
spider, and designation of critical habitat could further threaten the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act requires that Federal agencies insure that their actions are not likely to
jeopardize the continued existence of listed species, or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical
habitat. (See the ``Available Conservation Measures'' section for a further discussion of Section 7.) As part of
the development of this proposed rule, Federal and State agencies were notified of the spider's general distribution,
and they were requested to provide data on proposed Federal actions that might adversely affect the species. No specific
projects were identified. Should any future projects be proposed in areas inhabited by the spruce-fir moss spider,
the involved Federal agency will already have the general distribution data needed to determine if the species may
be impacted by their action. If needed, more specific distribution information would be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three of the four surviving populations of the spruce fir moss spider are considered to be extremely small, and suitable
habitat at each of the four sites still supporting the species is very limited. The precarious status of the species
means that any Federal action with the potential to result in significant adverse modification or destruction of
the species' habitat would also likely jeopardize its continued existence. Under these conditions, no additional
protection for the spruce-fir moss spider would accrue from critical habitat designation that would not also accrue
from listing the species. Consequently, when listed, habitat protection for the spruce-fir moss spider will be accomplished
through the Section 7 jeopardy standard and Section 9 prohibitions against take. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the spruce-fir moss spider is very rare and unique, and taking for scientific purposes and private collection
could pose a threat if specific site information was released. The publication of critical habitat maps in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, local newspapers, and other publicity accompanying critical habitat designation could increase the collection
threat. The locations of populations of these species have consequently been described only in general terms in this
proposed rule. Any existing precise locality data would be available to appropriate Federal, State, and local government
agencies from the Service office described in the ``

Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices. Recognition
through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that
recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed
or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) requires
Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of a proposed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species
is subsequently listed, Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize,
fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely
modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible
Federal agency must enter into consultation with the Service. The Service has notified Federal agencies that may
have programs which could affect the species. Federal activities that could occur and impact the species include,
but are not limited to, the carrying out or issuance of permits for construction, recreation or development actions
that could result in the loss or thinning of the high-elevation forest canopy, and pesticide or herbicide applications
for the control of noxious insects or weeds. It has been the experience of the Service, however, that nearly all Section
7 consultations have been resolved so that the species has been protected and the project objectives have been met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions
that apply to all endangered wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to take (includes harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or to attempt
any of these), import or export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer
for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry,
transport, or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service
and State conservation agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered wildlife species under
certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for
scientific purposes to enhance the propagation or survival of the species and/or for incidental take in connection
with otherwise lawful activities. In some instances, permits may be issued during a specified period of time to relieve
any undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief were not available. Such permits are not expected
for the spruce-fir moss spider since the species is not in trade.

Public Comments Solicited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposal will be as accurate and as effective as possible.
Therefore, comments or suggestions from the public, other concerned government agencies, the scientific community,
industry, or any other interested party concerning this proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly
are sought concerning: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning any threat (or lack thereof) to this species;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not
be determined to be critical habitat as provided by Section 4 of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and population size of this species; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possible impacts on this species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Final promulgation of the regulation on the spruce-fir moss spider will take into consideration the comments and
any additional information received by the Service, and such communications may lead to a final regulation that differs
from this proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act provides for a public hearing on this proposal, if requested. Requests must be received
within 45 days of the date of publication of the proposal. Such requests must be made in writing and should be addressed
to the Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Asheville Field Office, 330 Ridgefield Court, Asheville,
North Carolina 28806.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The three proposals being addressed at the public hearings are components of a coordinated Federal interagency initiative
responding to water management issues in the San Francisco Bay and Delta. EPA and the Service are working closely together
and with the National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to develop a comprehensive, habitat-oriented
approach to water and fish and wildlife resource management issues in California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat designation for the federally listed threatened delta smelt would provide additional protection
under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that require Federal agency action. As required by section 4 of
the Act, the Service will consider economic and other relevant impacts prior to making a final decision on the size
and configuration of critical habitat.
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento splittail occur in Suisun Bay and the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary in California.
The Sacramento splittail has declined by 62 percent over the last 15 years. This species is primarily threatened by
large freshwater exports from Sacramento and San Joaquin River diversions, prolonged drought, loss of shallow water
habitat, introduced aquatic species, and agricultural and industrial chemicals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has proposed a rule to establish three sets of Federal criteria to protect the designated uses of the San Francisco
Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. The three sets include: (1) Salinity criteria protecting the estuarine
habitat and other designated fish and wildlife uses; (2) salinity criteria (measured in electrical conductivity)
to protect the fish spawning (striped bass) designated use in the lower San Joaquin River; and (3) salmon smolt survival
index criteria to protect the fish migration and cold freshwater habitat designated uses in the estuary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearings and the extension of the comment periods will allow all interested parties to submit oral or written comments
on the three related proposals. The three proposed rules were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 6, 1994 (delta smelt (59 FR 852), Sacramento splittail (59 FR 862), and EPA water quality standards (59 FR
810)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice for the proposed water quality standards, EPA published its intent to hold public hearings during the week
of February 21, 1994, in Fresno, California; Sacramento, California; and San Francisco, California. After further
consideration, it was decided to add a fourth hearing in the Los Angeles, California area in order to expand the public's
opportunity to comment on these proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection 4(b)(5)(E) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), requires that the Service hold a public hearing, if it is requested within 45 days of the publication of a proposed
rule. In anticipation of public hearing requests, the Service announces a joint effort with EPA to hold four public
hearings in California on three related components of an interagency plan that addresses management of water and
fish and wildlife resources in the California estuary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service and EPA have jointly scheduled four public hearings: (1) February 23, 1994, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from
6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Holiday Inn Center Plaza, 2233 Ventura Avenue, Fresno, California; (2) February 24, 1994, from
1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Expo Inn, 1413 Howe Avenue, Sacramento, California; (3) February 25, 1994,
from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the EPA Regional Office, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California; and (4) February 28,
1994, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Irvine City Hall, 1 Civic Center Plaza, Irvine, California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those parties wishing to make statements for the record should bring copies of their statements to present to EPA and
the Service at the start of the hearings. Oral statements may be limited in length if the number of parties present at
the hearings necessitates such a limitation. There are, however, no limits to the length of written comments or materials
presented at the hearing or mailed to the respective agencies. Written comments carry the same weight as oral comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's January 6, 1994, notice set the due date for all written comments related to their proposed rule for March 11,
1994. The comment periods on the two Service proposed rules are extended to March 11, 1994. Written comments should
be submitted to EPA or the Service at their respective offices given above in the

Section 4(b)(3)(A) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1533) (Act), requires that the Service
make a finding on whether a petition to list, delist, or reclassify a species presents substantial scientific or commercial
information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. To the maximum extent practicable, this finding
is to be made within 90 days of receipt of the petition, and the finding is to be published promptly in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act further requires the Service to make a finding as to whether or not the petitioned action
is warranted within 1 year of receipt of a petition that presents substantial information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 18, 1993, the Service received a petition from Mr. Randall Morgan to list the Ohlone tiger beetle as an endangered
species under the Act. The petition was dated February 12, 1993. A letter acknowledging receipt of the petition was
mailed to the petitioner on March 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The finding is based on the species' description (Freitag

with entomologists familiar with the biology of tiger beetles, with planners, and with others who are knowledgeable
about proposed projects that may negatively affect the Ohlone tiger beetle. All documents and records of telephone
conversations upon which this finding is based are on file at the Ventura Field Office (see

1993; R. Morgan, pers. comm., 1993). All locations are within an approximate range of 16 square miles. There are six
other locations with suitable habitat where the Ohlone tiger beetle may occur in Santa Cruz County. One is at another
site at the north campus of the University of California at Santa Cruz; a second location is at Pogonip Open Space Preserve
adjacent to the University of California; a third area is in Soquel near the type locality; and a fourth is at another
site in Scotts Valley. The remaining two locations are northwest of Cabrillo College and near Seascape (Morgan,

yielded no Ohlone tiger beetles in 1991 or 1992.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of about 20,000 acres of pristine and disturbed grassland habitat remaining in Santa Cruz County, only 200 to 300 acres
contain the right combination of substrate, slope, and exposure to be deemed suitable habitat for the Ohlone tiger
beetle (Morgan,

1993). This habitat is currently limited to small disjunct areas near the coast in central Santa Cruz County. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The habitat type for this species was once more widespread and almost contiguous, ranging from the just west of the
city of Santa Cruz east along the coast and near-coastal areas to Seascape (Freitag 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, 1993). This area has been developed for residential, commercial, and agricultural use and includes the communities
of Santa Cruz, Capitola, and Live Oak. In adjacent Monterey County, these clay-based marine terrace grasslands have
already been urbanized (Freitag 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993). Limited suitable habitat may occur at low and mid-elevation coastal areas southwest of the Santa Cruz Mountains
in extreme southwestern San Mateo County (Freitag 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the four areas where the Ohlone tiger beetle has been documented, two are threatened by proposed residential development
(Freitag 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, 1993). At a third site, adult tiger beetles have been killed by bicycle traffic along a trail where the adult beetles
congregate. The University of California also plans to expand and construct university housing in habitat of the
Ohlone tiger beetle (Chris Aldecoa, University of California, Santa Cruz, pers. comm., 1993). At the Soquel site,
preliminary biological studies on vegetation have been completed for a proposed residential development (Morgan,

dominated by a woody overstory that would shade the grasses and eliminate areas necessary for thermoregulation.

The Ohlone tiger beetle is not currently protected by any regulatory mechanism. The California Endangered Species
Act does not apply to insects. The available information suggests that the species' restricted range and small population
size increase the chance of extirpation resulting from stochastic (i.e., random) or localized events, such as rock
slides, erosion, disease, or predation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petition and supporting information have been reviewed by staff at the Ventura Field Office and the Portland Regional
Office of the Service. The Service finds that the petition presents substantial information indicating that listing
the Ohlone tiger beetle may be warranted. The Service requests any additional data, comments, and suggestions from
the public, other concerned governmental agencies, the scientific community, industry, or any other interested
parties concerning the status of the Ohlone tiger beetle. Of particular interest is information regarding: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The existence and status of additional populations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Environmental factors determining distribution, including specific habitat needs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Early life history; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The response of populations to disturbances such as fire, clearing, or mowing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This decision is based on information contained in the petition and scientific and commercial information otherwise
available to the Service at this time.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In its previous notice on this subject (58 FR 38112; July 15, 1993), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) requested
information on plant and animal species that might lead the Service to prepare proposals to amend the CITES appendices
for consideration at the upcoming ninth meeting of the Conference of the Parties. That notice described the provisions
of CITES for listing species in the appendices and set forth information requirements for proposals. The present
notice announces the proposals received, explains why the Service does not intend to consider certain proposals,
and describes those proposals that will receive further consideration prior to a decision as to whether to submit
any of these proposals to the CITES Secretariat by the June 10, 1994, deadline.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service received proposals from the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), the Fauna and Flora Preservation
Society (FFPS), ICCAT Watch (a coalition consisting of the Center for Marine Conservation, the National Audubon
Society, and World Wildlife Fund-US), the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Oregon Natural Resources Council,
by September 28, 1993. These organizations proposed adding or transferring nine different taxa, and in addition,
EIA proposed transferring all bird species listed in Appendix III to Appendix II. In addition, the Service is considering
the development of certain other proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service continues to consider submitting proposals to amend the appendices for the following species: Narwhal
(for possible transfer from Appendix II to Appendix I); musk deer (for possible listing of species or populations
in Appendix I); saiga antelope (for listing in Appendix I or II); box turtles (add to Appendix II); copperbelly water
snake (add to Appendix II); bluefin tuna (add to Appendix II); whale shark (add to Appendix II); requiem and hammer-head
sharks (add to Appendix II); tarantulas (add to Appendix II); Port-Orford-Cedar (add to Appendix II with its logs,
sawn wood, and veneer only); bigleaf mahogany (add to Appendix II with exclusion of secondary and finished products);
and two genera of African mahoganies with their logs, sawn wood, and veneer only (for possible listing in Appendix
II). The Service will continue to consider a listing of freshwater pearly mussels that will provide protection to
the most endangered while excluding those easily identifiable species that are used in the pearl bead industry and
that are not believed to be threatened by trade. The Service is also considering a proposal to remove the non-African
populations of aloes from the appendices. In addition, the Service at the suggestion of the CITES Nomenclature Committee
will consider developing a proposal to clarify the present listing of the urial,

Proposals That the Service Does Not Plan To Submit
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
EIA submitted a recommendation with no accompanying information to transfer all birds listed in Appendix III to Appendix
II. The Service first notes that the basis for a country adding a species to Appendix III is different from the criteria
for including a species in Appendix II. Moreover, while trade ultimately may became detrimental to the survival of
any Appendix III species if not carefully regulated, insufficient information was presented by EIA to justify proposals
for individual species at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ICCAT Watch submitted a proposal to list the western Atlantic population of the bluefin tuna, Thunnus thynnus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in Appendix I. In a subsequent letter, after the November 1993 meeting of the Parties to the International Convention
for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), ICCAT Watch withdrew their request for the Service to consider proposing
this bluefin tuna population in Appendix I. Based on the actions taken by ICCAT (as presented later in this notice under
the consideration of an Appendix II listing for bluefin tuna), the Service does not believe that listing the western
population of bluefin tuna in Appendix I is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The blue shark, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Prionace glauca
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, was proposed for possible listing in Appendix II or III, by the National Audubon Society in 1991. The Service has reconsidered
the recommendation in preparation for COP9. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Fishery Management Plan
for Sharks of the Atlantic Oceans placed these sharks in the pelagic species group. In the preparation for development
of the management plan, a peer review effort by NMFS and non-NMFS experts evaluated the available information and
determined that there was no evidence available to indicate that the pelagic species group of sharks was overfished
in the Northwest Atlantic. In comparison with other sharks, blue sharks have a relatively high reproductive rate
and rapid growth rate, and are widely distributed. Hence, they may be more resilient and more robust with respect to
fishing pressure than many other shark species. Therefore, the Service does not intend to propose this species for
listing in Appendix II, or to list it unilaterally in Appendix III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals That the Service May Submit
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following proposals are being considered for submission as proposed amendments to the CITES appendices. The
Service seeks additional comments and information to assist it in making decisions whether to submit these proposed
amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Narwhal (Monodon monoceros)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EIA proposed that the narwhal be transferred from Appendix II to Appendix I. The Small Cetacean Subcommittee of the
Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission has had difficulty in carrying out stock assessments
for this species due to the amount of available data, and has expressed concern about catch levels and loss rates for
some narwhal populations. The degree to which trade, as opposed to hunting for food, determines the level of narwhal
catches is unclear. Therefore, the Service seeks information about population levels, stock structure, catches,
and trade of this species, but without additional information on the threat to the species, the Service is unlikely
to propose the transfer of this species to Appendix I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Musk Deer (Moschus spp.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service received a draft proposal from EIA to transfer the Appendix II populations of musk deer (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Moschus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp.) to Appendix I of CITES. The musk deer, represented by at least four valid species, have a wide distribution in
eastern Russia, Mongolia, Korea, China (including the Tibet Autonomous Region), the Himalayas (from northern Afghanistan
eastwards to Nepal and Bhutan), and marginally into northern Vietnam. They range from comparatively low elevations
(coniferous forests) to the highest growth of dwarf rhododendron and willow thickets (about 12,500 feet or 3,800
meters).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Musk deer are the most primitive of all living deer. Antlers are lacking in both sexes, and males have long upper canine
teeth that extend far below the upper lip. A musk gland in the abdomen of the male secretes a brownish wax-like substance,
which is used extensively in the manufacture of perfumes and soaps. About 28 to 30 grams (a little over an ounce) of the
secretion can be obtained from a single male. Due to their secretive nature and inaccessible habitat, little is known
about the population numbers of musk deer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the Fourth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP4) to CITES held in Botswana in 1983, the Parties voted to
transfer the Himalayan populations (Afghanistan, Bhutan, Burma, India, Nepal, and Pakistan) from Appendix II to
Appendix I. Although there are widespread reports of rampant poaching, the trade in musk is poorly documented. The
CITES Animals Committee working on significantly traded species, has identified this taxon as one for which possible
problems exist and has recommended: (1) That China and Russia suspend exports of specimens of musk deer, excluding
derivatives; and (2) that all Parties increase their enforcement efforts to ensure that all specimens of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Moschus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 spp. in international trade, including derivatives, have been legally exported. Therefore, the Service is considering
proposing the transfer of the Appendix II populations of musk deer to Appendix I. However, trade in musk from captive
stock is reported, and the CITES Animals Committee has requested a report on production from captive stocks and information
on the source of musk used for medicine manufacture and details of measures taken to control trade in manufactured
products. The Service seeks information on the effect of trade on these species, especially any data on the volume
of musk entering trade.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EIA submitted a draft proposal to the Service to include the saiga antelope in Appendix I of CITES. There are two recognized
subspecies: The Russian saiga (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Saiga tatarica tatarica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the Mongolian saiga (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Saiga tatarica mongolica
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Historically the saiga antelope ranged from the Ukraine to western Mongolia. Today, the species remains only in
the area stretching from the steppe east of the lower Volga River across Kazakhstan through the Dzungarian Basin of
northwest China to Mongolia. Presently, its distribution within Russia is not continuous, but is divided into disjunct
populations. Saiga antelopes inhabit steppes and semideserts, from sea level to 5,000 feet. This antelope lives
in large herds, and the early maturation and fecundity of this species allow for rapid population increases, reaching
60 to 80 percent annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1960s the saiga antelope was the most widespread wild ungulate in the U.S.S.R., and it was estimated that approximately
2 million animals inhabited Asia. However, the population in Mongolia is listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered
Species Act (ESA). Other than humans, wolves are the main predator of the species. Lack of fodder in winter is the most
important natural calamity causing mass mortality of saiga antelopes. This species is harvested for its meat, hides,
fat, as well as the horns, which are exported to China. Since the 1960s, little scientific information is available
on population size and trade in parts. The Service solicits additional information on international trade and population
status, in order to make its final decision on whether to propose the entire species for listing in Appendix II, and
if so, whether to propose any populations for Appendix I.

Ovis vignei
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 was included in Appendix I, as proposed by India, and was also referred to as urial and shapo. However, because there
was no supporting documentation submitted at the time of the proposed listing, and because different references
available in early 1973 attributed different subspecies and populations to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 it is not completely clear what population(s) the Parties intended to protect. Ellerman and Morrison-Scott's Checklist

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ovis orientalis

the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

At the time of the Second Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP2) in 1979, the Parties apparently considered

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ovis vignei
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to include populations of urial in Iran. This interpretation is based on the absence of any debate on the coverage of
the Appendix I listing when Iran proposed to delete

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ovis vignei arkal
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from Appendix I. (Iran later withdrew the proposal.) While one might have expected several Plenipotentiary meeting
participants to also have participated in COP2 and to have commented on any inconsistency between the original listing
and the proposal presented at COP2, it is not known with certainty what was the original intent of the Parties.

Adoption of a new nomenclatural reference by the Parties cannot change the entity originally listed, and, as previously

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Prior to the Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in 1992 (COP8), the New York Zoological Society submitted
a proposal to the Service for its consideration, to add the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terrapene
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (box turtles) to Appendix II, while retaining

T. coahuila
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Aquatic box turtle, or Coahuilan box turtle) in Appendix I. The Service initially considered submitting this proposal
for consideration at COP8, but decided not to due to a lack of trade data. The Service is now considering submitting
this proposal, based on both biological information and trade information from the Service's Law Enforcement Management
Information System (LEMIS). While a separate code for data entry of information on trade in specimens of this genus
was provided after COP8, the Service's records of exports and imports in LEMIS for species not listed in the CITES appendices
are to be considered as a minimum for the numbers of specimens in trade.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terrapene
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is comprised of four species (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Terrapene carolina
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is the most widely distributed species of box turtle, and is found from Canada to Mexico; its range is from Maine southward
to Florida, and westward through southern Canada to Michigan, Illinois, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Although widespread,
the species is reported to be rare or extinct in parts of its range in Maine, New Hampshire, Michigan, and Ontario, and
declining elsewhere in its range.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Box turtles are long-lived and slow-growing, with low annual reproductive output and late onset of sexual maturity
(10&hyph;20 years). They also have high site fidelity, and loss of adults from a population can have a significant
detrimental effect on the status of the population. Box turtles are important components of many terrestrial ecosystems.
Development activities have increasingly fragmented their habitats. The sale of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
T ornata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is restricted in several States, while allowed in others.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on Service LEMIS data, 26,817 box turtles were exported from the United States in 1992, and 18,134 were exported
in 1993. However, 1993 data are not yet fully entered into the computer system, and are thereby incomplete. These figures
represent the number of box turtles reported to the Service as being exported; it is not possible to ascertain how many
were removed from the wild. Whether or not this level of international trade in these species is detrimental to populations
must take into account the numbers removed from the wild for international trade along with the numbers removed from
the wild for other purposes, including but not limited to interstate and intrastate commerce, habitat loss, habitat
degradation, disease, and predation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service solicits additional information on population trends, levels of trade, and the affect of trade on population
status for review in deciding whether to submit a proposal to include the genus

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Nerodia erythrogaster neglecta,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of this water snake is considered to be threatened. The current distribution of this subspecies is restricted to the
lower Ohio River Valley and the lower Wabash River Valley in extreme southwestern Indiana and adjacent Illinois and
Kentucky, and in southern Michigan northeastern Indiana, and northwestern Ohio. Due to significant population
declines, especially in Michigan, Ohio, and northern Indiana, the subspecies now persists only in scattered, isolated
pockets where suitable habitat exists. The total population is estimated approximately 1,530 adults rangewide,
with 368 breeding pairs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A proposed rule to list the northern copperbelly water snake as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA)
was signed by the Service's Director on July 26, 1993. Recently there appear to be indications that this taxon is intercrossing
with another subspecies in areas of overlap of the ranges of these two taxa.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Habitat loss and fragmentation are the primary factors threatening the continued existence of the subspecies, but
amateur collectors reportedly continue to take snakes from the wild. It is sought because of its rarity, its large
size, its unique coloration, and its value in the pet trade. It is reported that an international commercial dealer
offered $260 for a breeding pair of northern copperbelly water snakes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is seeking information on the extent and significance of trade in the species, and would consider proposing
the entire species for Appendix II if there is sufficient concern about similarity of appearance.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service received a draft proposal from ICCAT Watch, a coalition consisting of the National Audubon Society, the
Center for Marine Conservation, and World Wildlife Fund-US, to list bluefin tuna throughout the Atlantic in Appendix
II.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Previously, a notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (56 FR 33894, July 24, 1991) seeking comments on a proposal from the National Audubon Society to list the western Atlantic
stock of bluefin tuna in Appendix I. The NMFS initially recommended that public comment be received on the merits of
proposing the species for listing in Appendix II. After review of all comments and available information, the Service
decided not to propose listing of the species in either appendix.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of the Atlantic bluefin tuna falls under the responsibility of parties to the ICCAT. Provisions of Article
XIV of CITES relieve ICCAT member countries from CITES obligations with respect to trade in specimens of marine species
included in Appendix II, if such trade is in accordance with the provisions of ICCAT and if a certificate stipulating
to this condition is given by the CITES Management Authority of the country of introduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For western Atlantic bluefin tuna, the current stock assessment (1993) by the ICCAT Standing Committee on Research
and Statistics (SCRS) estimated stock trajectories showing a significant decline from 1970 to 1992 but with a small
increase in 1993. The 1993 median estimate of abundance for 8-year-old and older tuna is 10.9 percent of the 1970 median,
20 percent of the 1977 median, 43 percent of the 1982 median, and 78 percent of the 1988 median. In terms of spawning biomass,
current abundance is estimated at between 6 percent and 12 percent of that which could produce maximum sustainable
yield. Projections by the SCRS stock abundance, based on the assumption that the current relationship between spawning
biomass and recruitment will prevail in the future, suggest that there is about a 50 percent chance of preventing further
decline in mature stock size if catches between 1994 and 2001 were limited to 1,200 metric tons per year (mt/yr). Lower
catches result in higher odds of preventing further reductions in spawning stock. The allowable catch in 1994 is,
1,995 mt. The allowable catch in 1995 is 1,200 mt, subject to scientific review of the most recent assessment results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, there is an uncertainty about the proper north-south dividing line between the western and eastern populations.
In recent years, Japanese vessels have harvested a substantial tonnage of bluefin tuna just east of the original N&hyph;S
line. At least a portion of this take may have included tuna from the western population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna, the 1992 assessment shows great variability in the abundance of the youngest age
groups (ages 1&hyph;4) over the period 1970&hyph;91). Estimates of abundance of fish 5 years old or older, which includes
most of the spawning stock, have shown a consistent downward trend, the average abundance of fish 5 years old or older
for 1990&hyph;92 being about one half the average estimate for 1970&hyph;72. Abundance estimates for the oldest
fish of this stock (ages 10 and older) have shown an even greater downward trend since 1970. The average estimated abundance
of fish in this age group for the period 1990&hyph;92 was about one third of the average estimate for the 1970&hyph;72
period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent (1991) estimated fishing mortality rates for eastern Atlantic bluefin are between 2 and 7 times the common
fishing mortality rate reference levels which are thought to result in long-term average yields near maximum sustainable
yield and provide adequate safeguards against recruitment failure. Over the long term, fishing mortality rates
as high as those estimated are likely to result in increased risks of stock collapse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At COP8, Sweden proposed the listing of the western Atlantic population of bluefin tuna in Appendix I and the eastern
Atlantic population in Appendix II. The proposal was withdrawn by Sweden at the meeting based on a set of conditions
which primarily included the requirement that ``ICCAT continue its initiatives, with particular emphasis on quota
reductions, to restore and maintain Atlantic bluefin tuna populations *&blank;*&blank;*.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the 1993 Regular Meeting of ICCAT, the quota for take of the species in the western Atlantic was reduced from the 1991
level by 25 percent of 1994 and by another 30 percent for 1995, for a 55 percent total reduction since Sweden submitted
its resolution to COP8. In addition, the quota for Japanese fishing vessels, in the central Atlantic, whose harvest
had been 450 mt annually from the western Atlantic and about 1,000 mt annually from the eastern Atlantic, was capped
at 1,300 mt for the 2-year period 1994&hyph;95.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Progress was made on other conservation measures, including the development of a Bluefin Statistical Document (similar
to a CITES certificate of origin), which would be required by all ICCAT countries for the importation of bluefin tuna.
This document is already required for frozen bluefin tuna imports. It will be partially implemented for fresh tuna
by June 1994, and full implementation is scheduled for December 1994, when the document must be validated by the appropriate
government official. An intersessional meeting is scheduled for spring 1994 to discuss, among other things, the
use of trade measures as an enforcement tool. Thus, a proposal to list this species in Appendix II may not be warranted
at this time based on the progress at the last two ICCAT meetings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, ICCAT has not yet fully implemented the quota reductions or the Bluefin Statistical Document Program, and
other measures may be necessary for ICCAT to take with respect to non-ICCAT countries in order to supplement the existing
conservation regime. Therefore, the Service requests comments on the merits for an Appendix II listing of the entire
Atlantic population, particularly with respect to collecting trade date concerning non-ICCAT countries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EIA proposed that the whale shark be considered for CITES protection, and subsequently provided a draft proposal
to include this species in Appendix II. Whale sharks are large filter feeders and exist in the temperate seas throughout
the world. Whale sharks are vulnerable to commercial harpoon gear and collisions with vessels. Whale sharks have
supported small to medium commercial fisheries in India, Pakistan, China, the Philippines, and Senegal, where catches
may be increasing. The flesh is eaten fresh or after being slated and dried.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The whale shark is slow growing and may produce few young, and consequently, may be easily overexploited. The NMFS
Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Oceans placed whale sharks in the large coastal species group,
and this group of sharks is considered to be overfished in the Northwest Atlantic and to have declined off southern
California. However, this species does not appear to be an important fisheries species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the recent increases in worldwide catches of sharks for the meat and fins, and for medicinal purposes, the
Service is requesting information this species, but without more specific information indicating population declines
or increases in trade, the Service may not have sufficient information to warrant submission of a proposal for this
species.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These species were proposed for review for inclusion in Appendix II or III, by the National Audubon Society in 1991.
At that time, the Service did not believe that sufficient information was available to propose these species for consideration
at COP8. However, the Service is re-examining this recommendation in preparation for COP9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These species are normally targeted by commercial shark longline and gillnet fisheries and are also subject to take
in recreational fisheries. The NMFS Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Oceans placed these sharks
in the large coastal species group, but many individuals of these species make extensive migrations. In the preparation
for development of the management plan, a peer review of effort by NMFS and non-NMFS experts evaluated the available
information and determined that the large coastal species group of sharks was overfished in the Northwest Atlantic.
As a consequence, catch quotas imposed for the large coastal shark species were set at levels representing a 30 percent
drop pattern. These sharks are vulnerable to overexploitation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the recent increases in worldwide catches of sharks for the meat and fins, and for medicinal purposes, the
Service is requesting information on these species. However, without more specific information indicating specific
population declines or increases in trade, the Service may not have sufficient information to warrant submission
of any proposal for these species.

10. Freshwater or Pearly Mussels (Family Unionidae)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The bivalve mollusc family Unionidae (pearly mussels or naiads) is one of the most diverse mollusc families in North
America. Their geographic distribution is widespread; naiads are found in most of the major river drainages in the
Southeast and Midwest, including the Upper Mississippi drainage system, and as far west as Oklahoma and Texas. Members
of this family also occur in Europe
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the Sixth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties in 1987, the Ten-Year Review Committee Chairman withdrew a proposal
to remove the six unionid species listed in Appendix II (with the other 26 species remaining in Appendix I) with the
understanding that the United States would review the need for the listings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the species included in Appendix I are listed as endangered pursuant to the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and
two of the species included in Appendix II are now listed as endangered. However, seven of the Appendix I species and
the remaining four Appendix II species are not listed as endangered or threatened under ESA. A few species of pearly
mussels are valued as a source of beads for the cultured pearl industry, and shells of these species as well as the pearls
made from such shells are heavily traded. The Service's concern is how to provide the appropriate protection to the
endangered pearly mussels without unnecessarily regulating the trade in the few commercially valuable, non-threatened
mussels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mussel shells used in the manufacture of cultured pearls are identifiable by their heavier, all white shells, and
they occur in larger rivers and reservoirs with few species of endangered mussels. Furthermore, State regulations
usually prohibit the collection of shells from those sections of rivers with significant populations of the endangered
mussels. Even with these and other State restrictions, some endangered mussels may be harvested by the divers; however,
it is believed that the buyers exclude shells not valuable for the making of pearl beads, and the exporters further
screen all shells to sort them into species and size categories to fill specific orders from foreign buyers. Therefore,
the likelihood of endangered mussels being exported for the pearl industry is extremely low.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather, the potential trade threat to the endangered species may be from shell collectors and the use of shells in the
jewelry industry. It is probably only the most endangered species that would be affected by trade for collections,
and the Service is endeavoring to determine whether there is any threat to endangered species from the trade in mussels
for jewelry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are about 58 endangered freshwater mussels and another 53 that may be endangered but for which definitive status
information is not yet available. If the most endangered of these species may be affected by trade, having the species
listed under CITES would provide additional protection for the species. Therefore, the Service is considering preparing
a proposal to list in Appendix I only the most endangered of the species (thus, downlisting some of the present Appendix
I species) and proposing the remainder of the native species for inclusion in Appendix II, except those clearly identifiable
species exported for the pearl industry. The basis for this proposal would be either because of status of the species
or for reasons of similarity of appearance. The species that the Service is considering excluding are:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This approach provides the shortest list (unless the entire unionid taxon were listed, which would add an unnecessary
permit burden), and the shorter list would assist enforcement officers in focusing their efforts. This approach
would also involve downlisting some species presently listed in Appendix I. An alternative may be that, for those
species where there is not a sufficient probability of trade to warrant any CITES listing, the Service might propose
the deletion of present Appendix I and II freshwater mussel species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service would especially appreciate comments as to whether information already available sufficiently identifies
the most endangered species so that further identification of these species by listing them in Appendix I does not
increase the threat from collection. Additional information on the trade in shells for the jewelry industry would
be appreciated, as well as comments on the above recommendations for species to be excluded from any proposal that
the Service may submit.

11. Tarantulas (Brachypelma spp.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has been considering listing additional 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
species to address look-alike concerns. As a result of the Service's discussions, a proposal was received from Dr.
Robert Wolff of Trinity Christian College, Palos Heights, Illinois, to list all members of the tarantula genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(also known as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Euathlus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelmides
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in Appendix II of CITES. Most species of this genus have very limited distributions within the general area of Central
America from northern Mexico south into Colombia, and are known only from a very limited geographic region within
a single country. The very limited distributions of these species places each in greater danger of possible extinction.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tarantulas are ground-dwelling, burrowing spiders occurring from semi-desert regions, through tropical dry deciduous
forests, to tropical moist forests. The red-haired 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tarantulas are very popular as pets. They are long-lived spiders; the females frequently live up to 20 years, with
as many as 12 possible years for breeding. The males are only mature for a single breeding season and are heavily preyed
upon during their wanderings. Whereas up to 400 individual eggs may be produced in each egg sac, the number of hatchlings
surviving to adulthood is extremely small (about 1 percent). Therefore, the loss of mature individuals from a population
is a major threat to the species; larger individuals are preferred by the pet trade. Several species in the genus are
poorly described or virtually unknown, and no thorough population studies have been conducted on any of the species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Very little is known about the trade in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tarantulas and most specimens are probably coming out of Mexico without proper documentation. Mexico prevents the
hunting and export of tarantulas without a permit. At the Fifth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (Buenos Aires,
1985), the United States proposed the inclusion of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma smithi 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(the red-kneed tarantula) in Appendix II because of widespread documented trade. The listing of all 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tarantulas would eliminate the present confusion over identification of which species are entering trade. Most
species within the genus are easily recognized by the red or reddish hairs on the legs or abdomen. The Service is, therefore,
considering the listing of all members of the genus 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Brachypelma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in Appendix II and seeks information on the effects of trade on these tarantulas, especially any data on the volume
of specimens entering trade.

12. Port-Orford-Cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the July 15, 1993, notice (58 FR 38112) which initiated listing preparation for COP9, the Oregon Natural
Resources Council provided a thorough draft proposal to include the Lawson-cypress or Port-Orford-cedar (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Chamaecyparis lawsoniana
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in Appendix II. This species is native to southwestern Oregon and northwestern California within a general coastal
area of less than 200 by 100 miles, mostly from about Coos Bay, Oregon south to Arcata, California. It is also in cultivation
(and has a number of horticultural varieties). The species has been reduced both in range and by over 85 percent in natural
standing volume, and is now logged almost entirely for export (primarily to Japan). An introduced pathogen (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Phytophthora lateralis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) has been spreading particularly along waterways and as a side effect of soil transport by vehicles and logging equipment.
The main stimulus for the logging of Port-Orford cedar is high export prices, and one important stimulus for the construction
of many logging roads is the export of raw logs. This fungus has spread through the northern and western portions of
the tree species' range, and it has infected perhaps 20 percent of the remaining coastal stands. The root disease is
virulent, and the infected trees cannot be cured. By the mid-1980s, an estimated 60 percent of the trees of this species
in southwestern Oregon's young-growth forests had been killed by this introduced disease.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is considering submission of a proposal to list the U.S. population of this species and its logs, sawn wood,
and veneer in Appendix II. Information is desired particularly on populations that are functioning naturally and
are effectively safe from habitat loss, exploitation, and infection; and in addition, information is requested
on the location of U.S. non-natural silvicultural plantations and the extent of such exports from them.

Swietenia humilis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Swietenia macrophylla 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(bigleaf mahogany), occurs from South America to Mexico; it apparently forms hybrids naturally with

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At COP8, Costa Rica and the United States proposed to include 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Swietenia macrophylla 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and its natural hybrid in Appendix II; the U.S. proposal excluded the Old World populations and secondary and final
products (e.g., finished products and derivatives). In a preliminary meeting during COP8, all the range States except
three (Bolivia, Peru and Honduras) tentatively supported the listing. Costa Rica decided to support the U.S. proposal.
However, because of lack of sufficient consensus, the United States withdrew its proposal (cf. 57 FR 20443, May 13,
1992).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the July 15, 1993, notice (58 FR 38112) that initiated listing preparations for COP9, the Natural Resources
Defense Council provided a new extensive draft proposal to include the neotropical populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Swietenia macrophylla
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and its natural hybrid in Appendix II, including only the timber and wood processed to the first stage of transformation
(i.e., primary products), such as logs, wood in the rough, sawn wood, veneer sheets, and plywood. The September 1993
meeting of the CITES Plants Committee favored submission of a proposal for this species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service regards the available information and data sufficient to support reproposing this species and its natural
hybrid, and believes that there is increasing understanding of the consequences and value of its regulation under
CITES Appendix II. The United States has become the main importer of this species, and the Service plans to provide
a draft proposal to the range States for their comments. Information is desired particularly on populations that
are functioning naturally and are effectively safe from habitat loss and exploitation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Fauna and Flora Preservation Society provided draft proposals to list the African mahoganies in Appendix II.
African mahoganies include the genera 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Entandrophragma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(about 11 species) and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Khaya 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(about 6 species), which are native to the tropics of Africa, with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Khaya 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
extending to the Comoros Islands and Madagascar. Some of the 17 species are in cultivation, including some silvicultural
plantations. The majority of the species have some legal protection in one or more countries, generally with respect
to their export. All of the species have been declining due to habitat conversion and selectively varied commercial
exploitation, and nearly all of them have been reported to be threatened in various countries and significant portions
of their ranges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has recognized the need to conserve most 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Khaya 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and some 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Entandrophragma 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
species, being concerned with their genetic erosion. The September 1993 meeting of the CITES Plants Committee reviewed
draft proposals for these genera, and favored the circulation of these drafts for their possible submission. In November
1993, Germany circulated them to the range States for their views. The Service may join with Germany's initiative,
or provide draft proposals to the range States by April 1994 for their comments. Information is desired particularly
on populations of each species that are functioning naturally and are effectively safe from habitat loss and exploitation.

 (synonym 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aloe barbadensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The genus is essentially African in range, extending to Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula, and perhaps naturally
to the Canary Islands. Plants regarded as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aloe vera
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 have been used for millennia and the yellow-flowered species may be extinct in its native range in the wild; it may have
been native to the Canary Islands, or perhaps the southern Arabian Peninsula or northeastern Africa (e.g., Ethiopia),
where similar species occur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The whole plants commonly in trade as aloe vera are of artificially propagated (or also naturalized) origin. Their
regulation has become an enforcement burden. To deal with this situation, the Service is considering submission
of a proposal by June 1994 to remove the non-native populations of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Aloe
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that are geographically unrelated to the general African area. Thus, all species of

Aloe

the Canary Islands and Socotra) and the Arabian Peninsula, would continue to be regulated by CITES. The September
1993 meeting of the CITES Plants Committee favored submission of some such proposal on this problem, and the conservation
committee of the International Organization for Succulent Plant Study offered to assist in its preparation. Information
is requested on whether exclusion of plants from this non-native population of

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS corrects the notice of receipt of petition for rulemaking on issues relating to Atlantic highly migratory species
published on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67761). The National Fishing Association (NFA) petitioned NMFS to restrict
commercial net fishing in certain months in five special management zones defined in the petition for the offshore
waters of the northwest Atlantic Ocean. The petition also requests mandatory logbooks for recreational vessels
fishing for certain highly migratory species and a revised definition of a commercial fishing vessel. This document
corrects the longitude and latitude coordinates of the restrictive fishing zones.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend its public information regulations to help ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identities of those who report adverse events associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human drugs, biologics, and medical devices, and the identities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of patients are held in confidence and not disclosed by FDA, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided in current agency rules, or by manufacturers that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possess these reports. The proposed rule is intended to preempt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the establishment or continuation in effect of any State or local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law, rule, regulation, or other requirement that requires or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits disclosure of such identities. This action is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken to maintain the agency's ability to collect information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about safety risks of FDA-regulated products that is vital to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection of the public health.

A. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A critical public health activity of FDA is to monitor the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of human drugs, biologics, and devices in the marketplace. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of postmarketing surveillance programs to monitor the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of these products, FDA relies heavily on its adverse event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting systems. These reporting systems are important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adjuncts to the product approval process, which is based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily on testing conducted before a product is marketed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although preapproval testing provides significant information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about the safety and efficacy of a product, not all potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety problems can be identified in the preapproval stage when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of subjects exposed to the product and the period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure are necessarily limited. For that reason, the receipt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of postmarket reports of adverse events associated with a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated product is critical to the agency's ability to help 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect the public health.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reporting by physicians and other health care professionals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of adverse experiences associated with the administration of most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products is strictly voluntary. As the agency's primary source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of adverse event information, this voluntary reporting system has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revealed significant adverse events and drug interactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with products that could not be identified during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preapproval testing. There are many instances of important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health actions that have been the direct or indirect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of information provided through voluntary reporting by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual health professionals. The removal of the antibiotic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temafloxacin (Omniflox) from the market, research concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
danger of concurrent use of the antihistamine terfenadine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Seldane) when taken with either the antifungal ketoconazole or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the antibiotic erythromycin, and the warning labeling requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for latex products are just a few examples that demonstrate why 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA strongly encourages voluntary reporting by physicians and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other health professionals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a major effort to increase voluntary reporting of serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse events by health professionals, FDA recently announced a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new reporting system called MEDWATCH. This program is designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make it easier for health care providers to report serious 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse events and to clarify what type of information should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported. The agency believes that preserving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality of the identities of the patient and of third 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties involved with an adverse event report, such as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician or others identified in the report, is essential to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
success of the adverse event reporting system. Accordingly, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although the substantive content of adverse event reports is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 552, FDA regulations have long protected the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality of the patient, reporter, and institution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved in the adverse event (&sect;20.111 (21 CFR 20.111)). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, which have been in place since 1974, have enabled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA to obtain voluntary reports of adverse events and to protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the confidentiality of information that could identify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although these regulations protect the release of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidential information by FDA, they do not protect the release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the same information contained in reports held by drug, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biologic, and device manufacturers. Various State and local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments have laws, regulations, or rules that permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure of this information in litigation, through discovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or otherwise. Recently, plaintiffs in several product liability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and medical malpractice cases have attempted to discover the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identities of reporters and patients named in adverse event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports in the possession of the product manufacturers. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed above, this same information is protected from public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure when it is contained in similar or identical reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to FDA and in FDA's possession. To avoid jeopardizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the willingness of the health care community to make reports of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse events to manufacturers and FDA, the agency believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a similar confidentiality rule is needed to prevent disclosure or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threats of disclosure of the identity of reporters or subjects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse event reports in the possession of manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure meaningful reporting under the new MEDWATCH 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program, FDA believes that additional steps must be taken to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safeguard the confidentiality of the identities of those involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with adverse event reports. State and local laws, regulations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or rules that permit or require the disclosure of patient and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporters' identities interfere with the agency's objective of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring the safety of human drugs, biologics, and devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA is proposing to amend its regulations to prohibit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disclosure of such information contained in reports held by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA, as provided currently, and similar information held by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers. The proposal also would preempt State and local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laws, regulations, or rules that permit or require such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosure. Disclosure would be permitted if both the reporter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the person identified in the report consent to disclosure or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if there is a discovery order in malpractice litigation between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the subject of the report and the reporter of the adverse event.

B. FDA Adverse Event Reporting Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Drug and Non-Vaccine Biological Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA receives postmarketing adverse drug reaction (ADR) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports directly from manufacturers, health professionals, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumers. An adverse drug or biologic experience means any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse event associated with the use of the product in humans, whether or not the event is considered related to the
drug or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biologic. Included are events that occur in the course of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional use, from drug overdose (whether intentional or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidental), from drug abuse, from drug withdrawal, and any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure of an expected pharmacological action (&sect;314.80 (21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
314.80(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA regulations require drug manufacturers to report to FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
serious and unexpected adverse reactions and increased frequency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of serious expected reactions. These reports must be filed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within a specific time after the manufacturer receives the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. Manufacturers are also required to submit periodic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports of all adverse reactions (&sect;314.80). FDA has proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar adverse experience reporting requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers of licensed biological products (March 29, 1990, 55 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FR 11611) and expects to publish final regulations in the near 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future. The reporting of these adverse reactions by health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professionals to either manufacturers or FDA, however, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
strictly voluntary. (Health care providers are required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report certain adverse events associated with specific vaccines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act. See section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I.B.3 of this document.) The agency is also preparing a proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule to require adverse drug reaction reporting by manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of nonprescription drug products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1992, the agency received 105,945 ADR reports. The majority of the reports (88 percent) were sent by manufacturers,
while the remaining 12 percent were sent directly to FDA by health professionals or consumers. Of all the ADR reports
received by the agency, 22,704 were considered serious. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that these figures represent only a fraction of the serious adverse events encountered by health care
providers. A recent review article found that between 3 and 11 percent of hospital admissions could be attributed
to adverse drug reactions (Ref. 1). Only about 1 percent of serious events are reported to FDA, according to one study
(Ref. 2). Another study states that reporting rates in the United States are apparently lower than those in some other
countries (Ref. 3). The majority of studies that have investigated the occurrence of adverse drug events in hospitalized
patients estimate that from 10 to 20 percent of all patients will experience an adverse drug event while hospitalized
(Ref. 4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon receipt of the ADR report, the agency enters the information into its computerized data base of all ADR reports,
the spontaneous reporting system (SRS). Every report of a serious adverse reaction is evaluated for its potential
significance. The agency determines whether similar incidences were reported in the SRS, the temporal relationship
between the administration of the drug and the reaction, possible confounding factors, and other information related
to the adverse event. In many cases, follow-up information is requested from the reporter or the manufacturer. Because
of resource constraints, the agency often relies on the manufacturer to screen the ADR reports and conduct any necessary
follow-up by contacting the reporter. For this reason, similar or identical reports of adverse drug events will be
in the possession of both FDA and individual drug manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information provided by voluntary reports from health professionals alerted FDA that the recently approved antibiotic
temafloxacin (Omniflox) was associated with a serious type of anemia. Because of the severity of the risk associated
with this drug, which became apparent only after the product was approved and used in larger numbers of patients, it
was removed from the market. ADR reporting from health professionals also prompted FDA to undertake research that
showed that a fatal reaction could occur when the antihistamine terfenadine (Seldane) is taken in combination with
the antifungal ketoconazole (Nizoral) or with the antibiotic erythromycin. Drug interactions also reflect the
fact that individual variability in drug metabolism can account for significant differences in patient response.
Such response differences make well-designed postmarketing studies and health care provider observations and
reports especially important. Other examples of FDA actions prompted by ADR reports include: The alert that serious
liver damage may be associated with labetalol, a drug for high blood pressure; the recall of the nonnarcotic pain relieving
drug zomepirac (Zomax), after reports that it may cause a severe allergic reaction that can result in death; the alert
that the use of the antibiotics in the fluoroquinolone class and the anticoagulant warfarin may result in increased
blood clotting time, which can lead to hemorrhage; and the recent boxed warning and alert to health professionals
regarding the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Postmarketing surveillance of the safety of devices depends on the success of both required and voluntary systems
of reporting. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976
(Pub. L. 94&hyph;295) (the 1976 amendments) (21 U.S.C. 360i) and the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;629)
(the SMDA) (21 U.S.C. 360i(e)), and regulations thereunder, require manufacturers and distributors of devices
to submit reports to FDA, within a specific timeframe, of deaths and serious injuries related to certain devices and
of malfunctions. The SMDA also requires device user facilities, such as hospitals, nursing homes, and outpatient
treatment centers, to report to FDA and the manufacturer, within a certain timeframe, information that reasonably
suggests that a device has or may have caused a death. Device user facilities also are required to report to the manufacturer,
or to FDA if the manufacturer is unknown, information that reasonably suggests that a device has caused, or may have
caused, or may have contributed to a serious illness or serious injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1973, the agency has maintained a voluntary device problem reporting program. Last year, about 4,500 reports
were voluntarily submitted to this program, in addition to the statutorily required reports from manufacturers,
distributors, and user facilities. Both the voluntary and the statutorily required reporting systems for devices,
as with those for drugs, ultimately depend on the willingness of the individual health care professionals to submit
reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1991, voluntary reporting led the agency to alert health professionals to a potentially fatal hypersensitivity
to latex products. In addition, through the voluntary reporting system, FDA learned of increased numbers of deaths
associated with physical patient restraints, often used by hospitals and nursing homes to restrain patients. Based
on these reports and other information, FDA has restricted patient restraint devices to prescription use only and
has taken steps to ensure proper labeling to prevent deaths and injuries. After receiving a report by a physician about
two patients who experienced blindness after the physician's use of an ophthalmic device during eye surgery, FDA
investigated the manufacturer and initiated a recall to remove these devices from the market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some areas, however, inadequate reporting has fostered delays in detecting problems. One example is silicone
breast implants. Although these devices had been on the market for over 30 years, only in recent years had evidence
begun to accumulate about their possible association with autoimmune-like disorders. Had the agency received reports
from health care providers when they initially observed these disorders in patients with breast implants, the agency
could have assessed this possible association at an earlier date.

3. Vaccines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (the NCVIA) requires health care providers who administer certain
vaccines and manufacturers of those vaccines to report to the Government specified adverse events (42 U.S.C. 300aa-25).
All reports are made to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), which is maintained by FDA and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). FDA strongly encourages health care providers to report all suspected
adverse events related to vaccines, in addition to those required to be reported by law, to VAERS. Reports submitted
to VAERS are evaluated by FDA and CDC to identify vaccine-specific incidence and adverse event trends. For reports
made pursuant to the NCVIA, the identity of the patient or the patient's legal representative cannot be made available
to the public. However, for such reports, the identity of the health care provider is available to the public (42 U.S.C.
300aa-25(c)). For vaccine adverse event reports not submitted pursuant to the NCVIA, for example, for vaccines other
than certain childhood vaccines, the identities of the patient, reporter, and institution involved are not disclosed
to the public under FOIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. The MEDWATCH Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The goal of FDA's new MEDWATCH program is to underscore the important role of health care providers in identifying
and reporting serious adverse events that may be related to FDA- regulated products. The program will make it easier
for health care providers to report adverse events, clarify the type of reports that should be made, more widely disseminate
information on FDA actions that have resulted from adverse event reporting, and increase physician awareness of
drug- and device-induced disease. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the MEDWATCH program, several separate forms previously used to report adverse events and product problems
with various products have been consolidated into a single, one page reporting form. Health professionals can use
this form for reports on drug products, biological products, devices, and special nutritional products (dietary
supplements, medical foods, and infant formula). The unified reporting form will be more readily available to providers
in several publications and from a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week toll free number operated by FDA. There is also now a single
receipt point for these reports; no longer will providers be expected to send different reports for medications and
devices to different places in FDA. Health professionals can send the reports to the agency via facsimile or can report
electronically by computer, responding to questions that appear on the monitor's screen. Health professionals
can also send reports to manufacturers, who in turn will transmit them to FDA. Device manufacturers, user facilities,
and distributors subject to mandatory reporting requirements will continue to submit their reports as specified
in the applicable regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The important message of the MEDWATCH program is that health professionals should report any event that is suspected
to be related to an FDA-regulated product and is associated with a serious outcome such as death, a life-threatening
condition, initial or prolonged hospitalization, disability, congenital anomaly, or an event that requires intervention
to prevent permanent impairment or damage. The object is to capture as many reports of serious adverse events as possible
in order to use that information to enhance the safety of FDA-regulated products. In general, the agency does not care
whether the voluntary report goes directly to FDA or to the manufacturer_as long as the event is reported. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many segments of the health care community have long supported agency efforts to increase voluntary reporting of
adverse events by professionals. The practice standards for the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists contain
a statement that ``pharmacists in organized health-care settings should develop ongoing programs for monitoring
and reporting ADRs'' and should ``[r]eport serious or unexpected ADRs to FDA'' (Ref. 5). The Joint Commission on Accreditation
of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) has standards for monitoring and reporting adverse medication and device events
(Ref. 6). These standards require hospitals to report unexpected or significant adverse reactions promptly to FDA
and to the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To further support FDA's voluntary MEDWATCH program, the American Medical Association's (AMA) Council on Ethical
and Judicial Affairs recently released an opinion memorandum in 1993 that it is a physician's ethical responsibility
and obligation to communicate any suspect occurrence of an adverse reaction to a drug or device to the medical community,
including FDA.

II. The Problem_Confidentiality of Reporters' Identities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA believes that its success in encouraging health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professionals to participate in the voluntary adverse event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting system depends substantially on the guarantee of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality given the identity of the reporter under FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations (&sect;&sect;20.111(c)(3), 314.430(e)(4), 601.51(e)(3), and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
803.9(b)). When FDA receives a request from the public for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse reaction reports submitted voluntarily by health care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professionals, consumers, patients, or manufacturers, FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations require public disclosure of those reports only after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deletion of the following: (1) The names and any information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would identify the person using the product, and (2) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
names and any information that would identify any third party 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved with the report, such as a physician, hospital, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institution (&sect;20.111). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale for this policy was first articulated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 24, 1974, in the preamble to FDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public information regulations. At that time, FDA determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that without a guarantee of confidentiality, ``the possibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persuading health professionals voluntarily to submit adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaction information is substantially diminished, and indeed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perhaps wholly destroyed'' (39 FR 44602 at 44616). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the SMDA amendments, Congress provided some additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection from involvement in private civil lawsuits to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physicians who submit voluntary reports concerning adverse device 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events. Section 519(b)(3) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360i(b)(3)), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added by the SMDA, provides that: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[n]o report made under [the device user 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility requirements] by a physician who is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not required to make such a report, shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
admissible into evidence or otherwise used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any action involving private parties unless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the facility, individual, or physician who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made the report had knowledge of the falsity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the information contained in the report. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Congress enacted this provision to encourage private physicians 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to notify FDA or the manufacturer of device problems (H. Rept. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
808, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 21 (1990)). This provision, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be sufficient to prevent manufacturers from being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compelled to release the reporters' or patients' identities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to a discovery order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The policy and program considerations underlying the need to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect patient and reporter confidentiality have become even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more compelling in recent years. The increase in product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability and medical malpractice litigation has heightened the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reluctance of health professionals to report events observed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them if they are not given meaningful promises of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality. In addition, the potential for discrimination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connected with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive status or acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome (AIDS) has strengthened the commitment of health care professionals to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect patient privacy. As a direct reflection of FDA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longstanding regulations and commitment to this policy, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's MEDWATCH form (and its predecessors) expressly states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the information identifying the patient and reporter is held 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in confidence (see 58 FR 31611 through 31612, June 3, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in connection with FDA's current efforts to promote 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the MEDWATCH program and to increase reporting of serious adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events, the health care community has voiced concerns about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency's ability to safeguard confidentiality and protect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identities of the reporter and patient identified in the report, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
especially in situations where the report is in the possession of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an individual manufacturer. Despite FDA's longstanding policy of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
keeping these identities confidential, the current concerns 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threaten to undermine the success of the voluntary reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA published its draft uniform MEDWATCH form for reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspect adverse events and product problems on February 26, 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 11768). Subsequently, the agency received several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments about FDA's ability to maintain the confidentiality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient and reporter identities: (1) When the report of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse event is made directly to the manufacturer or (2) when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the manufacturer receives the information from FDA after a report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is made to the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MEDWATCH form permits individuals reporting directly to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agency to indicate that they do not want their identity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disclosed to the manufacturer. However, the agency encourages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporters to allow the agency to share the reporter's identity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the manufacturer in order to help FDA and the manufacturer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct necessary followup. Currently, State and local laws 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
govern disclosure of information from adverse event report forms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are in the possession of manufacturers, whether the reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
come directly to the manufacturer from reporters or are relayed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to manufacturers by FDA. Some State and local laws allow or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require disclosure of identities of reporters and patients in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse event reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA believes that if the identities of reporters or patients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were made public or available to third parties, health care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professionals would be much more reluctant to submit voluntary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse event reports for fear of involving themselves and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patients in litigation. It is well recognized that many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physicians are concerned about the potential for involvement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
litigation by their patients or third parties. In a 1992 survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of physicians regarding adverse event reporting, over 37 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the respondents agreed with the statement that reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases the risk of becoming involved in litigation; 18 percent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the respondents listed fear of becoming involved in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative or legal process as an important reason for not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting adverse reactions (Ref. 7). Several other surveys 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been conducted which asked physicians what factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influenced their decision not to report an adverse event (Refs. 8, 9, and 10). Between 8 and 14 percent of the respondents
in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the studies stated that concern over legal liability was one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason why they did not report an adverse event. Moreover, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reporter is a health care professional, particularly a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician, the reporter may fear that disclosure of his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identity would increase the chances that a patient's identity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be discovered, thus risking a breach of the confidential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician-patient relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years FDA has learned of a number of product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liability lawsuits in State courts in which manufacturers have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been requested or ordered to provide the names of persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting adverse reactions to particular products. In some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instances, the names of the affected patients have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested. The manufacturers involved in these cases vigorously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposed discovery requests that sought the disclosure of patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and reporter identities. Occasionally, when the disclosure issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was being litigated, the manufacturers requested that FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formally express its views on the disclosure of these identities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the effects such disclosure might have on the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postmarketing surveillance program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA firmly believes that the success of its postmarketing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance efforts is dependent upon protecting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality of individuals involved in adverse experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports. Thus, FDA took the unusual step of becoming involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a number of these cases by filing, with the assistance of the Department of Justice, a statement of the Federal government's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest. The statement informed the courts of the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage the agency believes would be done to its postmarketing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance program and the public health if the identities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patients and reporters were released to plaintiffs in these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cases. The agency believes that its efforts have contributed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued protection of reporter and patient identities in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cases in which FDA has participated.

III. The Need for Federal Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has determined that in order to help assure beneficial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and consistent reporting of adverse events to the agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MEDWATCH program, State and local rules that would permit or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require disclosure of the identities of reporters and patients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
named in the reports must be clearly preempted by FDA's amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Laws that permit disclosure of the identities of health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional reporters or patients identified in the reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly interfere with FDA's ability to collect information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required under sections 505(k) and 519 of the act (21 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
355(k) and 360i). Section 505(k) requires manufacturers to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit information about approved drug products in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enable FDA to monitor the safety of the product and ``facilitate a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination'' of whether the drug should be withdrawn from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market. This provision is implemented in &sect;314.80 (21 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
314.80) of the FDA regulations, which establishes mandatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting requirements of adverse reactions for manufacturers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drugs.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 519 of the act requires device manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distributors, importers, and user facilities to submit to FDA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports of certain adverse events to ensure the safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of devices. FDA has implemented this provision in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations establishing mandatory reporting requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, importers, and distributors (21 CFR part 803). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also has proposed regulations establishing reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for user facilities (see the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 26, 1991 (56 FR 60024)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.C. 262(d)), biological products are licensed in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with regulations ``designed to insure the continued safety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purity, and potency'' of these products. Under FDA's implementing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, a biological product license may be revoked if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product does not conform to applicable standards or is not safe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and effective (21 CFR 601.5(b)). The agency's proposed biologics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse experience reporting regulations would establish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory reporting requirements for manufacturers of most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological products (see the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 29, 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(55 FR 11611)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although these reporting requirements are or will be mandatory for manufacturers, device distributors, and device
user facilities, these required reports ultimately rely upon voluntary reporting by health professionals. Manufacturers
cannot report adverse events if they do not find out about them from the health professionals who observed or were advised
of the events. As stated in section II. of this document, disclosure of patient or reporter identities serves as a significant
disincentive for voluntary reporting by health professionals. Preempting State and local disclosure laws and rules
that permit or require such disclosure would remove a significant impediment to FDA's ability to implement postmarketing
surveillance programs that are essential to the public health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, sections 505(k) and 519 of the act provide that regulations and orders issued with respect to postmarketing
reporting requirements ``shall have due regard for the professional ethics of the medical profession and the interests
of patients *&blank;*&blank;*'' (21 U.S.C. 355(k) and 360i). The confidentiality of the physician-patient relationship
is a basic tenet of medical ethics. The AMA Code of Ethics requires that, with certain limited exceptions, ``(t)he
utmost effort and care must be taken to protect the confidentiality of all medical records'' (``1992 Code of Medical
Ethics, Annotated Current Opinions,'' Section 5.07; and see the ``1991 Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice of
the American Nursing Association''). The recent AMA opinion that physicians have an ethical obligation to report
adverse drug or device events is likely to be incorporated in medical practice if confidentiality can be ensured (Ref.
11). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA firmly believes that the public health interest in securing information from health professionals about potential
hazards associated with marketed products far outweighs the interest an individual plaintiff may assert to obtain
reporters' identities in private tort actions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA recognizes the sophistication and complexity of private tort litigation in the United States and the proposed
preemption action is not intended to frustrate or impede tort litigation in this area. Indeed, FDA recognizes that
product liability plays an important role in consumer protection. The proposed regulation has been drafted to permit
any individual plaintiff who experienced an adverse event and subsequently has become involved in medical malpractice
litigation with the person who reported the event to obtain all the information contained in the adverse event report.
In this situation, where both parties to the litigation know each other's identities, the interests of the parties
in protecting this information is minimized and, therefore, would not impose a significant disincentive to reporting.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Principles of Preemption Law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, State law may be preempted by Federal law in a number of ways (U.S. Const.,
Art. VI, cl. 2.). Congress may preempt State law by so stating in express terms (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 430 U.S. 519 (1977)). Section 521 of the act contains an express preemption provision applicable to devices. Under
that section, no State may establish a requirement for a device ``different from, or in addition to'' any requirement
applicable to the device under the act relating to safety or effectiveness or other matter included in an applicable
requirement. (See 21 CFR part 808; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even when Congress has not expressly preempted State law, congressional intent to preempt may be inferred in several
ways. Preemption may be found ``where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable
the inference that Congress `left no room' for supplementary state regulation'' (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another way the courts infer a congressional intent to preempt is by determining that State law actually conflicts
with Federal law. The conflict may be demonstrated either when ``compliance with both federal and state [law] is a
physical impossibility'' (

its goals. (See

B. Conflicts Between State Disclosure Laws and Federal Law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The conflicts between State and local disclosure laws and Federal law on reporting of adverse events justify FDA's
preemption of these laws. Although Congress did not expressly preempt State law in this area, the agency's action
is appropriate because State and local laws significantly interfere with the methods by which the Federal law is designed
to achieve its goals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA is the Government agency charged with protecting citizens by helping to ensure that medical products, including
human drugs, biologics, and devices, are safe and effective for their intended uses. To further this purpose, Congress
established elaborate mechanisms for the Federal government to permit marketing of new drugs, biologics, and devices
and to monitor the safety of these products after approval (21 U.S.C. 355(k) and 360; 42 U.S.C. 262). Pursuant to these
statutory provisions, FDA has established an extensive regulatory scheme to monitor the safety and effectiveness
of new human drugs, biologics, and devices (&sect;&sect;310.305, 314.80, and &sect;&sect;803.1 through 803.36).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and local rules of civil procedure, rules of evidence, and other laws and regulations that permit discovery
of the reporters' and patients' identities are an obstacle to accomplishing this goal. Moreover, with respect to
devices, such laws, regulations, and rules are different from the confidentiality requirements under the act and
FDA regulations that implement adverse event reporting under section 519 of the act. Although reporter identities
in voluntary adverse event reports contained in FDA records are not subject to discovery in State litigation, those
reports that are in the possession of the manufacturer may be subject to State or local disclosure laws. The possibility
of such disclosure will chill the willingness of reporters to share information with FDA, which may share details
about a report with a manufacturer in order to investigate the report further. Preemption of State and local disclosure
laws will remove an inhibiting influence on health professionals and will increase adverse event reporting. FDA
has determined that such increased reporting outweighs the individual needs of plaintiffs to obtain information
about the reporters and subjects of adverse reaction reports that are not about the plaintiff.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation is narrowly drawn and focuses solely on protecting the identity of the reporter and patient
and other individuals identified in the report. This proposed rule does not preempt State and local laws that require
disclosure of the substance of adverse event reports. The agency does not believe that disclosure of the substance
of the adverse event reports will impede its ability to collect this information. Indeed, FDA routinely releases
the full substance of all voluntary adverse event reports to requestors after deletion of patient, reporter, and
institution identities (&sect;20.111(c)(3)(iii)). Nor will the regulation impede the ability of an individual
plaintiff to obtain specific information about reports concerning his or her own reaction to a product when that plaintiff
is involved in a medical malpractice lawsuit and a court grants discovery of records directly concerning the plaintiff.

V. Summary of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's rule to preempt State and local laws, rules, regulations or other requirements that would permit the disclosure
of the identity of health care professionals who report adverse events associated with FDA regulated products and
the identity of patients and other individuals named in those reports would be codified in newly proposed &sect;20.63(f).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;20.63(f) would provide that the names and any identifying information, including the address of
the reporter or the name or address of the institution, that would lead to the identification of the reporter or the
persons named in a voluntary adverse event report, shall not be disclosed by either FDA or a manufacturer in possession
of such report in response to any request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;20.63(f)(1) would provide exceptions to the prohibition of disclosing the names if both the reporter
and the person identified in the adverse event report consent to disclosure of their identities, or if there is a court
order in a medical malpractice action involving both the person named in the report and the reporter. Proposed &sect;20.63(f)(1)(iii)
would permit disclosure of an adverse event report to the individual who is the subject of the report upon request.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;20.63(f)(2) explicitly states that no State or local entity shall establish or continue in effect
any law, rule, regulation or other requirement that permits or requires the disclosure of the identities of the reporter
or person identified in an adverse event report except as provided in this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Executive Order 12612: Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the effects of this proposal on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, as
required by Executive Order 12612 on ``Federalism.'' The agency concludes that preemption of State or local rules
that permit disclosure of the identities of the voluntary reporter or persons identified in an adverse event report
for human drugs, biologics, and devices is consistent with this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12612 recognizes that Federal action limiting the discretion of State and local governments is appropriate
``where constitutional authority for the action is clear and certain and the national activity is necessitated by
the presence of a problem of national scope (section 3(b)). The constitutional basis for FDA's authority to regulate
the safety and efficacy of human drugs, biologics, and devices is beyond challenge. Congress' decision to vest FDA
with the responsibility to establish a regulatory scheme to monitor the safety of these products demonstrates Congress'
view that the safety of human drugs, biologics, and devices is a problem of national scope (21 U.S.C. 355(k) and 42 U.S.C.
262)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12612 expressly contemplates preemption where there is a conflict of State and Federal authority
under Federal statute (section 4(a)). State and local rules of civil procedure, rules of evidence, and other rules
and regulations that permit or require disclosure of the identities of those who report adverse events associated
with human drugs, biologics, and devices are an obstacle to fulfilling FDA's charge to monitor the safety and efficacy
of these products. The guarantee of confidentiality of the reporters' and patients' identities is necessary to assure
meaningful reporting of adverse events. In addition, Congress specified that Federal regulations issued to monitor
the safety of drug products ``shall have due regard for the professional ethics of the medical profession and the interests
of patients'' (21 U.S.C. 355(k) and 360i). State and local rules and regulations that permit disclosure of the identities
conflict with this requirement by jeopardizing confidentiality and the physician-patient relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order 12612 requires that any Federal preemption be restricted to the minimum level necessary to achieve
the objectives of the statute pursuant to which the regulations are promulgated (section 4(c)). The proposed regulation
is narrowly drawn and focuses solely on protecting the identity of the reporter and patient and other individuals
named in the report. The proposed rule does not preempt State and local laws that require disclosure of the substance
of the adverse event reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by the Executive Order, States will be given, through this notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunity
to participate in the proceedings to preempt State and local laws (section 4(e)). In addition, pursuant to the Order,
the appropriate officials and organizations representing the States will be consulted before this proposed action
is implemented (section 3(a)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency concludes that the policy proposed in this document has been assessed in light of the principles, criteria,
and requirements in Executive Order 12612; that this policy is not inconsistent with that Order; that this policy
will not impose additional costs or burdens on the States; and that this policy will not affect the States' ability
to discharge traditional State governmental functions.

VII. Economic Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has considered the economic impact of this proposed rule and concludes that it would impose no additional costs
on industry or the general public. The value to an individual litigant of having the identities of reporters and subjects
of adverse experiences is difficult to estimate; however, litigants will have available the substance of adverse
experience reports, which is of greater importance. Although tort litigation could provide substantial economic
benefit to an individual litigant, the net gain to health care and public health through efficient and complete reporting
of serious adverse reactions greatly outweighs any damage an individual litigant may suffer from lack of access to
the names of patients or reporters who are not parties in the litigant's lawsuit. Accordingly, FDA concludes that
this proposed rule is not significant as defined by Executive Order 12866 and certifies that this proposed rule would
not have a substantial economic effect on a significant number of small entities which would require a regulatory
flexibility analysis under the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.

(b) Contracts for the sale of individually owned forest products shall be executed by the Indian owner(s) or the Secretary
acting pursuant to a power of attorney from the Indian owner(s). Contracts must be approved by the Secretary to be valid.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Upon the request of the owner of an undivided but unrestricted interest in land in which there are trust or restricted

(a) Pursuant to the provisions of 25 U.S.C. 413 and 25 U.S.C. 3105, a forest management deduction shall be withheld
from the gross proceeds of sales of forest products harvested from Indian forest land as described in this section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Gross proceeds shall mean the value in money or money's worth of consideration furnished by the purchaser of forest
products purchased under a contract, permit, or other document for the sale of forest products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Forest management deductions shall not be withheld where:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The total consideration furnished under a contract, permit or other document for the sale of forest products is
less than $5,001; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The monies collected are derived from trespass, defaulted contracts or other civil judgments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Except as provided in &sect;163.25(e), the amount of the forest management deduction shall not exceed the lesser

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) For Indian forest lands located on an Indian reservation, a written expenditure plan for the use of forest management
deductions shall be prepared annually and approved by the authorized tribal representative(s) and the Secretary.
The approval of the expenditure plan by the authorized tribal representatives constitutes appropriation of tribal
funds for Indian forest land management activities. Approval of the expenditure plan by the Secretary shall constitute
authority for crediting of forest management deductions to tribal account(s). The full amount of any deduction collected
by the Secretary plus any income or interest earned thereon shall be available for expenditure according to the approved
expenditure plan for the performance of forest land management activities on the reservation from which the forest
management deduction is collected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For Indian forest lands located outside the boundaries of an Indian reservation, forest management deductions
shall be handled in a manner similar to that described under &sect;163.25(f)(1) if the expenditure plan approved
by an Indian tribe and the Secretary provides for the conduct of forest land management activities on such lands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For public domain and Alaska Native allotments held in trust for Indians by the United States, forest management
deductions may be utilized to perform forest land management activities on such lands in accordance with an expenditure
plan approved by the Secretary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Forest management deductions withheld pursuant to this section shall not be available to cover the costs that
are paid from funds appropriated for fire suppression or pest control or otherwise offset Federal appropriations
for meeting the Federal trust responsibility for management of Indian forest land.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Within one hundred twenty (120) days after the close of the tribal fiscal year, tribes shall submit to the Secretary
a written report detailing the actual expenditure of forest management deductions during the past fiscal year. The
Secretary shall have the right to inspect accounts, books or other tribal records supporting the report.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Forest management deductions incorporated into an expenditure plan approved by the Secretary shall remain available
until expended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) As provided in &sect;163.25(f) only forest management deductions that have not been incorporated into an approved
expenditure plan may be deposited to a U.S. Treasury receipt account. No amount collected as forest management deductions
shall be credited to any Federal appropriation. No other forest management deductions or fees derived from Indian
forest land shall be collected to be covered into the general funds of the United States Treasury.

pursuant to &sect;163.19, shall be under forest product harvesting permit forms approved by the Secretary. Permits
will be issued only with the written consent of the Indian owner(s) or the Secretary, for harvest of forest products
from Indian forest land, as authorized in &sect;163.20. To be valid, permits must be approved by the Secretary. Minimum
stumpage rates at which forest products may be sold will be set at the time consent to issue the permit is obtained. Payment
and bonding requirements will be stipulated in the permit document as appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Free use harvesting permits issued shall specify species and types of forest products to be removed. It may be stipulated
that forest products removed under this authority cannot be sold or exchanged for other goods or services. The estimated
value which may be harvested in a fiscal year by any individual under this authority shall not exceed $5,000. For the
purpose of issuance of free use permits, individual shall mean an individual Indian or any organized group of Indians.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Paid permits subject to forest management deductions, as provided in &sect;163.25, may be issued. Unless otherwise
authorized by the Secretary, the stumpage value which may be harvested under paid permits in a fiscal year by any individual

an individual or any operating entity comprised of more than one individual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A Special Allotment Timber Harvest Permit may be issued to an Indian having sole beneficial interest in an allotment
to harvest and sell designated forest products from his or her allotment. The special permit shall include provision
for payment by the Indian of forest management deductions pursuant to &sect;163.25. Unless waived by the Secretary,
the permit shall also require the Indian to make a bond deposit with the Secretary as required by &sect;163.21. Such
bonds will be returned to the Indian upon satisfactory completion of the permit or will be used by the Secretary in his
or her discretion for planting or other work to offset damage to the land or the timber caused by failure to comply with
the provisions of the permit. As a condition to granting a special permit under authority of this paragraph, the Indian
shall be required to provide evidence acceptable to the Secretary that he or she has arranged a bona fide sale of the
forest products, on terms that will protect the Indian's interests.

(a) The Secretary is authorized to maintain facilities and staff, hire temporary labor, rent fire fighting equipment,
purchase tools and supplies, and pay for their transportation as needed, to maintain an adequate level of readiness
to meet normal wildfire protection needs and extinguish forest or range fires on Indian land. No expenses for fighting
a fire outside Indian lands may be incurred unless the fire threatens Indian land or unless the expenses are incurred
pursuant to an approved cooperative agreement with another protection agency. The rates of pay for fire fighters
and for equipment rental shall be the rates for fire fighting services that are currently in use by public and private
wildfire protection agencies adjacent to Indian reservations on which a fire occurs, unless there are in effect at
the time different rates that have been approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may also enter into reciprocal agreements
with any fire organization maintaining protection facilities in the vicinity of Indian reservations or other Indian
land for mutual aid in wildfire protection. This section does not apply to the rendering of emergency aid, or agreements
for mutual aid in fire protection pursuant to the Act of May 27, 1955 (69 Stat. 66).

(1) Cases in tribal court
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The measure of damages to be applied in cases of timber and related trespass in tribal court will be that prescribed
by the law of the tribe in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the trespass was committed, unless Federal
law prescribes a different rule. Where tribal law does not supply a measure of damages, the measure shall be that prescribed
by the law of the state in which the trespass was committed, unless Federal law prescribes a different measure.

Cases in Federal court
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The measure of damages to be applied in cases of timber and related trespass in Federal court will be that prescribed
by Federal law. In the absence of applicable Federal law, the measure shall be that prescribed by the law of the tribe
in whose reservation or within whose jurisdiction the trespass was committed and by the law of the state in which it
was committed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Civil penalties for trespass include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Treble damages, whenever any person, without lawful authority, willfully injures, severs, or carries off from
Indian land any tree, timber, or shrub. Proof of Indian ownership of the premises and commission of the acts by the trespasser
are prima facie evidence that the acts were committed willfully, intentionally, and without requisite consent.
Treble damages shall be based upon the fair market value of the highest-valued product obtainable from the raw materials
involved in the trespass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Double damages, whenever a trespasser can prove that the trespass act was casual or involuntary, or that the trespasser
had probable cause to believe that the land on which the trespass was committed was his own or that of the person in whose
service or by whose direction the act was done. Double damages shall be based upon the fair market value of the highest-valued
product obtainable from the raw materials involved in the trespass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Payment of costs associated with damage to Indian forest land including, but not limited to, rehabilitation,
reforestation, lost future revenue, loss of productivity, and damage to other forest resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Payment of all reasonable costs associated with the enforcement of these trespass regulations beginning with
detection and including all processes through the prosecution and collection of the settlement, such as field examination
and survey, damage appraisal, investigation assistance and reports, witness expenses, demand letters, court costs,
and attorney fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Payment of civil penalties may involve collection of cash, forfeiture of real and personal property, and garnishment.
Any cash or other proceeds realized from forfeiture of equipment or other goods or forest products damaged or taken
in the trespass, shall be applied to civil penalties and other expenses incurred by the enforcement agency and the
beneficial owner(s) damaged by the trespass. After disposition of real and personal property to pay civil liability
penalties and enforcement costs of the trespass, any residual funds shall be returned to the trespasser. In the event
that collection and forfeiture actions taken against the trespasser result in less than full recovery of civil penalties,
penalty damages collected will be equitably distributed among beneficial owners based on the estimate of damages
for the trespass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Indian beneficial owners who trespass, or are involved in trespass upon their own land, or undivided land in which
such owners have a partial interest, shall not receive damages collected as a civil penalty in consequence of the trespass.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Civil penalties collected under &sect;163.29(a) shall be treated as proceeds from the sale of forest products
from the Indian forest land upon which the trespass occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) When there is reason to believe that Indian forest products are involved in trespass, the agency superintendent
or such other representative of the Secretary with responsibility for the reservation may prohibit the removal of
such forest products from Indian land or have such forest products seized for safekeeping and use as evidence of trespass.
When there is reason to believe that Indian forest products are involved in trespass and that such products have been
removed to land not under government supervision, the representative of the Secretary with responsibility for the
reservation shall immediately notify the owner of the land or the party in possession of the trespass products that
such products could be Indian trust property involved in a trespass and that no action to remove or otherwise dispose
of such products may be taken unless authorized by the Secretary. The representative of the Secretary shall cause
Indian forest products that can be positively identified to be sold where practicable to recover their value for the
beneficial Indian owners prior to deterioration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Whenever an individual authorized to enforce against trespass activity has probable cause to believe that trespass
activity has occurred, such individual may seize and take possession of the products and/or equipment involved in
the trespass activity. All equipment seized shall be kept in the custody of the enforcement agency for use as evidence
unless otherwise ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. The representative of the Secretary simultaneously
with any seizure shall give written notice of the seizure to the party in possession of the products and/or equipment
involved in the apparent trespass activity. Such notice shall include the statement that the seizure may be administratively
appealed pursuant to part 2 of this Title.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(g) The representative of the Secretary or the authorized tribal representative will promptly determine if a trespass
has occurred. The appropriate representative shall issue an official notice of trespass to the alleged trespasser
and, if necessary, the possessor or potential buyer of any trespass products. The notice will inform the trespasser,
buyer, or processor, that the Bureau of Indian Affairs has determined that a trespass has occurred, of the basis for
the determination, and of the seizure of forest products and/or equipment involved in trespass and that the determination
and the seizure may be administratively appealed as actions of the Bureau of Indian Affairs under part 2 of this Title.
Said representative shall post a trespass notice on the property. Any forest product seized under these procedures
may be sold or otherwise disposed of as determined appropriate by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and such action shall
not be stayed by the filing of an administrative appeal. The Secretary's and tribe's representatives will be jointly
responsible to coordinate prosecution of trespass actions and involve the appropriate officers of the Bureau of
Indian Affairs and the tribe(s). Except where the Secretary defers to tribal prosecution or the tribe chooses not
to be so bound, said representatives will determine the appropriate forum(s) for prosecution of each case not administratively
settled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Indian tribes that adopt the regulations set forth in this section, conformed as necessary to tribal law, shall
have concurrent civil jurisdiction to enforce section 307 of the National Indian Forest Resources Management Act
of 1990 and this section against any person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Secretary shall acknowledge said civil jurisdiction over trespass, upon: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Receipt of a formal tribal resolution documenting the tribe's adoption of this section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Notification of the ability of the tribal court system to properly adjudicate forest trespass cases, including
a statement that the tribal court will enforce the Indian Civil Rights Act or a tribal civil rights law that contains
provisions for due process and equal protection that are similar to or stronger than those contained in the Indian
Civil Rights Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Where an Indian tribe has acquired concurrent civil jurisdiction on trespass cases as set forth in paragraph (j)(1)
of this section, the Secretary shall, upon request of the tribe, defer prosecution of forest trespasses to the tribe.
Where said deferral is not requested, the designated Bureau of Indian Affairs forestry trespass official shall coordinate
with the forest trespass official of each tribe the exercise of concurrent tribal and Federal trespass jurisdiction
as to each trespass. Such officials shall review each case, determine in which forums to recommend bringing an action,
and promptly provide their recommendation to the officials responsible for initiating cases in the selected forum(s).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Secretary may rescind deferral to prosecute civil trespass: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Upon determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the tribal court has not adhered to the due process
and equal protection requirements of the Indian Civil Rights Act in forest trespass cases, and the failure of the tribal
court to meet said requirements; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If no determination is forthcoming after one year from a tribal court's action in a forest trespass case that the
Secretary determines violates said requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If the Secretary determines that said rescission is justified, he or she shall provide written notice to the chief
judge of the tribal judiciary of the findings justifying said rescission and of steps needed to remedy violations
of due process and/or equal protection. If said steps are not taken within 60 days, the Secretary may rescind deferral.
The affected tribe(s) may appeal a rescission under part 2 of this Title.

(b) When a majority of trust interest in a tract has consented, the Secretary may issue revocable road use and construction
permits for removal of forest products over and across such land. In addition, the Secretary may act for individual
owners when: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) One or more of the individual owner(s) of the land or of an interest therein is a minor or a person non compos mentis,
and the Secretary finds that such grant, in total or for an interest therein, will cause no substantial injury to the
land or the owner, which cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The whereabouts of the owner(s) of the land or an interest therein are unknown, and the owner(s) of any interests
therein whose whereabouts are known or majority thereof, consent to the grant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The heirs or devisees of a deceased owner of the land or interest therein have not been determined, and the Secretary
finds the grant will cause no substantial injury to the land or any owner thereof, provided that once the heirs or devisees
of the deceased owner are determined, their consent is obtained; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The owners of interests in the land are so numerous that the Secretary finds it would be impractical to obtain the
consent of the majority and finds that such grant in total or an interest therein will cause no substantial injury to
the land or the owner(s), which cannot be adequately compensated for by monetary damages.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Category 2 includes minor forested reservations comprised of less than 10,000 acres of trust or restricted commercial
timberland and having less than a one million board foot harvest of forest products annually, or whose forest resource
is determined by the Secretary to be of significant commercial timber value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Category 3 includes significant woodland reservations comprised of an identifiable trust or restricted forest
area of any size which is lacking a timberland component, and whose forest resource is determined by the Secretary
to be of significant commercial woodland value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A group of tribes which has either established or intends to establish a cooperative tribal forestry program to
provide forest land management services to their reservations may apply and qualify for tribal forestry program
financial support. For purposes of financial support under this provision, the cooperative tribal forestry program
and the commercial forest acreage and annual allowable cut which it represents may be considered as a single reservation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A Working Group of the Office of the Chairman of the Administrative Conference has completed a set of model procedure
and practice regulations, with related commentary, suitable for use in those agency proceedings that offer an opportunity
for an oral, fact-finding hearing before an agency adjudicator, whether conducted pursuant to the Administrative
Procedure Act, other statutes, or agency regulations or practice. Hearings are currently held before presiding
officers at scores of federal departments and agencies. Each agency has its own set of procedure and practice rules
that cover essentially the same procedural areas. To the extent that the conduct of hearings at these agencies presents
similar problems, it appears useful to formulate a set of model procedure and practice rules that addresses common
procedural problems. Such model regulations can be used by those agencies that are either required to establish formal
procedures for new adjudicatory programs or interested in amending their existing rules in selected areas. Because
each agency has its own, unique procedural needs, the model rules are not intended as a set of uniform procedures. Rather,
they are designed to provide a set of recommendations that can be considered by agencies in light of their special procedural
requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Government of Israel (the ``GOI'') wishes to select a financial advisor in connection with the issuance of U.S.
Agency for International Development (``USAID'')-guaranteed loans. The USAID-guaranteed loans have been authorized
by Public Law 102&hyph;391, and are being provided in connection with Israel's extraordinary humanitarian effort
to resettle and absorb immigrants into Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union, Ethiopia and other countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislation authorizes the guaranty by USAID of up to $10 billion principal amount of loans over the next five-year
period, with a maximum of $2 billion in loans, offered in one or more tranches, to be guaranteed in each of the five fiscal
years. This Notice is in connection with the GOI's selection of a financial advisor for an offering contemplated to
be made under the five-year authorization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GOI would like to receive proposals from interested firms on an expedited basis. Proposals must be submitted in
accordance with a Request for Proposals available from the GOI, by February 4, 1994. For information regarding the
submission of proposals, please contact Mr. Eliahu Ziv-Zitouk, Chief Fiscal Officer, Ministry of Finance of the
Government of Israel, 350 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10118 (fax: 212/736&hyph;2759).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The selected financial advisor will not be eligible to participate in the underwriting of the guaranteed loans.

INITIATION OF INVESTIGATION:

The Petition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 30, 1993, we received a petition filed in proper form by Rhone-Poulenc Specialty Chemicals Co. (petitioner).
Petitioner submitted amendments to the petition on January 13 and 14, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, petitioner
alleges that imports of coumarin from the People's Republic of China (PRC) are being, or are likely to be, sold in the
United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act),
and that such imports are materially injuring, or threatening material injury to, a U.S. industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner stated that it has standing to file the petition because it is an interested party, as defined under section
771(9)(C) of the Act, and the petition is filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product subject to this
investigation. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the
Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, it should file a written notification with the
Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All forms and variations of coumarin are included within the scope of the petition, such as coumarin in crystal, flake,

). Coumarin is classifiable under subheading 2932.21.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.

United States Price and Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner based United States price (USP) on average unit prices derived from U.S. Census import statistics, and
on price lists from U.S. importers of coumarin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner contends that the foreign market value (FMV) of PRC-produced imports subject to this investigation must
be determined in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, which concerns non-market economy (NME) countries. The
PRC is presumed to be an NME within the meaning of section 771(18)(C) of the Act, and the Department has treated it as
such in previous investigations (see, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Compact
Ductile Iron Waterworks Fittings and Accessories Thereof from the PRC, 58 FR 37908 (July 14, 1993)). In the course
of this investigation, parties will have the opportunity to address this NME presumption and provide relevant information
and argument on this issue. In addition, parties will have the opportunity in this investigation to submit comments
on whether FMV should be based on prices or costs in the NME (see Amendment to Final Determination of Sales at Less Than
Fair Value and Amendment to Antidumping Duty Order: Chrome-Plated Lug Nuts from the People's Republic of China, 57
FR 15052 (April 24, 1992)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the extent of central control in an NME, the Department further considers that a single antidumping margin,
should there be one, is appropriate for all exporters from the NME. Only if individual NME exporters are free of central
government ownership and can demonstrate an absence of central governmental control with respect to the pricing
of exports, both in law and in fact, will they be considered eligible for separate, owner-specific deposit rates.
(See Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Helical Spring Lock Washers from the People's Republic
of China, September 20, 1993, (58 FR 48833) for a discussion of the information the Department considers appropriate
to warrant calculation of separate rates.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, FMV in NME cases is based on NME producers' factors of production (valued
in a market economy country). Absent evidence that the PRC government determines which factories shall produce for
export to the United States, we intend, for purposes of this investigation, to base FMV only on those factories in the
PRC which are known to produce coumarin for export to the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner calculated FMV on the basis of the valuation of the factors of production. The factors of production used
by petitioner were based on petitioner's experience at its manufacturing facility, which it states is comparable
to the PRC production process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In valuing the factors of production, petitioner used India as the surrogate country. For purposes of this initiation,
we have, pursuant to section 773(c)(4) of the Act, accepted India as an appropriate surrogate country because its
economy is comparable to the PRC's.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioner's FMV consisted of the sum of materials, labor, energy, utilities, overhead, general expenses, profit,
and packing. In accordance with the hierarchy preferred for valuing factors (set forth in the notice of Final Determination
of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From the People's Republic of China,
57 FR 21058 (May 18, 1992) (Comment 4)), petitioner relied where possible on publicly available information. Where
such information was unavailable, petitioner relied on its own cost or experience. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to section 773(c)(1) of the Act, petitioner added to the labor and material costs the statutory minima of
10 percent for general expenses and eight percent for profit, as well as an amount for packing based on import statistics
from India.

Fair Value Comparisons

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the data provided by the petitioner, there is reason to believe that the merchandise is being, or is likely
to be, sold at less than fair value. Based on our analysis of information submitted in the petition amendment, we found
it necessary to conduct further research regarding the pricing of certain factors of production upon which FMV was
based. Subsequent to that research, petitioners submitted amendments to the petition including additional price
information. The comparison of USP and FMV in the petition, as amended, indicates margins of 33.59% to 444.37%. If
it becomes necessary at a later date to consider the petition as a source of best information available (BIA), we may
review all of the bases for USP and FMV in determining BIA.

Initiation of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have examined the petition on coumarin and have found that it meets the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act.
Therefore, we are initiating an antidumping duty investigation to determine whether imports of coumarin from the
PRC are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ITC will determine by February 14, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of coumarin from
the PRC are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Any ITC determination which is negative
will result in this investigation being terminated; otherwise, this investigation will proceed according to statutory
and regulatory time limits.

PRELIMINARY DETERMINATION
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Case History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the publication of the notice of initiation in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 60845, November 18, 1993), the following events have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 23, 1993, we issued a questionnaire to the Government of Venezuela (``GOV'') in Washington, DC., concerning
petitioners' allegations. On January 5, 1994, we received responses from the GOV and Oxidaciones Organicas, C.A.
(Oxidor). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of Investigations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this investigation, phthalic anhydride (``PA'') is an aromatic synthetic organic chemical usually
produced from a primary petrochemical called orthoxylene, although sometimes it is produced from naphthalene.
PA is predominately used in the production of plasticizers, unsaturated polyester resins, and alkyd resins, which
in turn are generally used to produce plastics and paints. The subject PA is produced in two physical forms, molten
and flaked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PA subject to this investigation is currently classified under subheading 2917.35.00 of the Harmonized Tariff
Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes,
our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Injury Test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 31, 1990, Venezuela became a contracting party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Since
qualification as a ``country under the Agreement'' under section 701(b)(3) requires a finding that the GATT does
not apply between the United States and the country from which the subject merchandise is imported, Venezuela is no
longer eligible for treatment as a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning of section 701(b)(3). However,
because Venezuela is a GATT contracting party and the merchandise under investigation is nondutiable, the ITC is
required to determine whether, pursuant to section 303(a)(2), imports of this merchandise from Venezuela materially
injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. On December 1, 1993, the ITC preliminarily determined that
there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason
of imports of PA from Venezuela.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners are Aristech Chemical Corporation, BASF Corporation, Koppers Industries, Inc. and Stepan Company.
Petitioners state that they represent 75 percent of the domestic phthalic anhydride industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Respondents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Government of Venezuela and Oxidor are respondents. While there are two producers of PA in Venezuela, Oxidor accounted
for over 85 percent of exports to the United States during the POI and, hence, was selected as the sole respondent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Analysis of Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this preliminary determination, the period for which we are measuring bounties or grants, the period
of investigation (``the POI''), is April 1, 1992 to March 30, 1993, which corresponds to Oxidor's fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with our practice in preliminary determinations, when a response to an allegation denies the existence
of a program, receipt of benefits under a program, or eligibility of a company or industry under a program, and the Department
has no persuasive evidence showing that the response is incorrect, we accept the response for purposes of the preliminary
determination. All such responses, however, are subject to verification. If the response cannot be supported at
verification, and the program is otherwise countervailable, the program will be considered a bounty or grant in the
final determination.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon our analysis of the petition and the responses to our questionnaires, we preliminarily determine the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Program Preliminarily Determined Not To Be Countervailable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Preferential Pricing of Orthoxylene Feedstock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners alleged that the government-owned petrochemical company, Petroquimica de Venezuela, C.A. (``Pequiven''),
is selling orthoxylene (an input product to PA) to Venezuelan producers of PA at preferential prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its response, the GOV stated that, within Venezuela, Pequiven sells orthoxylene to only two customers, both of
which produce PA. Furthermore, it stated that the prices that Pequiven charges these companies are tied to international
prices for orthoxylene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to determine whether the GOV, through the state-owned company, Pequiven, provided orthoxylene to PA producers
at preferential prices, we followed the hierarchy for determining benchmark prices as found in &sect;355.44(f)
of the Department's Proposed Regulations (54 FR 23381, May 31, 1989). The Department's preferred benchmark is the
non-specific price that the government charges to the same or other users of the same good within the political jurisdiction.
As noted above, within Venezuela, Pequiven sells orthoxylene only to the two PA producers. Both PA producers are charged
the same price by Pequiven. As a result, we do not have a non-specific price to use as a benchmark. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of a non-specific price, the Department normally looks to the alternative benchmarks listed in &sect;355.44(f)(2)
of the Proposed Regulations. The first alternative listed in the Proposed Regulations is the price charged by the
same seller for a similar or related good adjusted for any cost differences. The petition identified paraxylene and
mixed-xylene as two similar products. While Pequiven agrees that these two products, in addition to metaxylene,
are similar products to orthoxylene, it does not produce or sell those products. Pequiven did not identify any other
similar products. Therefore, we were unable to use this approach to calculate a benchmark. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second alternative listed in the Proposed Regulations is the price charged within the jurisdiction by other sellers
for an identical good or service. As stated in Carbon Black from Mexico; Preliminary Results of Countervailing Duty
Administrative Review (51 FR 13269, April 18, 1986), ``[t]hese other sellers may include private sellers within
the jurisdiction or foreign sellers selling into the jurisdiction *&blank;*&blank;*'' Pequiven is the only domestic
producer/seller of orthoxylene in Venezuela. However, orthoxylene was imported into Venezuela during the POI.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The GOV provided U.S. export statistics on shipments of orthoxylene to Venezuela during the period 1992&hyph;1993.
From these statistics, we used the information on the one entry that occurred during the POI to calculate a benchmark
price since this price reflects ``a price charged within the jurisdiction by other sellers for an identical good.''
This import into Venezuela from the United States was reported on a FAS basis. Therefore, we added an amount for ocean
freight and insurance from the United States to Venezuela. The amount for ocean freight and insurance was obtained
from an independent shipping company (see memorandum from case analyst to the file, January 13, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We then compared the adjusted import price to the price Pequiven charged for orthoxylene in the month that orthoxylene
was exported from the United States. Based on this comparison, we found that Pequiven's price was greater than the
price of imported orthoxylene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of this preliminary determination, we find the use of a single import price to be a sufficient basis
for our analysis. We examined prices in the largest international markets for orthoxylene and found minimal price
fluctuations during the POI. In addition, the import price approximated the prices in these markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, as stated above, Pequiven ties its domestic prices to international prices. Therefore, we would expect
to find only negligible differences between the price Pequiven charges domestically and the price of imports into
Venezuela. To test this assumption, we averaged U.S. import prices for the three months in which we had data (one within
the POI and two within two months of the POI on either side). We compared this average to the average price Pequiven charged
in the same three months and found that Pequiven's average price was greater than the average price of the imports from
the United States. Therefore, we find that the GOV, through Pequiven, did not provide orthoxylene to PA producers
at preferential rates during the POI.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Programs Preliminarily Determined Not To Be Used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We preliminarily determine that producers or exporters in Venezuela of the subject merchandise did not receive benefits
during the POI for exports of the subject merchandise to the United States under the following programs: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
A. FINEXPO Preferential Short-Term Export Loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. FINEXPO Preferential Long-Term Export Loans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Excessive Tariff Drawback 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Preferential Tax Exemptions Under the 1966 Income Tax Law 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because we find that the GOV did not provide orthoxylene at preferential rates and all other programs were not used,
we preliminarily determine that no benefits which constitute bounties or grants within the meaning of the countervailing
duty law are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters of PA from Venezuela.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 27, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of intent to revoke the antidumping
duty order on large electric motors from Japan. Two clerical errors appeared in that notice with regard to the deadline
for filing objections to the revocation of this order. As a result, the Department is making amendments to that notice.
The second paragraph of the summary section is being amended to read as follows:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Domestic interested parties who object to this revocation must submit their comments in writing no later than thirty
days from January 27, 1994.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first paragraph of the section titled ``opportunity to object'' is being amended to read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
No later than thirty days from January 27, 1994, domestic interested parties as defined in &sect;353.2(k) (3), (4),
(5), and (6) of the Department's regulations may object to the Department's intent to revoke this antidumping duty
order.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
No interested parties requested an administrative review in accordance with the Department's notice of opportunity
to request administrative review by the end of the anniversary month. If domestic interested parties do not object
to the Department's intent to revoke within thirty days from January 27, 1994, we shall conclude that the order is no
longer of interest to interested parties and shall proceed with revocation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 27, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of intent to revoke the antidumping
duty order on staples and staple machines from Sweden. A clerical error appeared in that notice with regard to the deadline
for filing objections to the revocation of this order. As a result, the Department is making amendments to that notice.
The second paragraph of the summary section is being amended to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Domestic interested parties who object to this revocation must submit their comments in writing no later than thirty
days from January 27, 1994.

INITIATION OF INVESTIGATIONS: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 30, 1993, we received petitions filed in proper form by five producers of stainless steel bar (AL Tech Specialty
Steel Corp., Carpenter Technology Corp., Republic Engineered Steels, Slater Steels Corporation and Talley Metals
Technology, Inc.) and one labor union (United Steelworkers of America, AFL&hyph;CIO/CLC) (collectively, petitioners).
On January 4, 1994, and January 7, 1994, Electralloy Corp. and the Crucible Specialty Metals Division of the Crucible
Materials Corp., respectively, notified the Department that they are also petitioners in these investigations.
In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, the petitioners allege that imports of stainless steel bar from Brazil, India, Italy,
Japan and Spain are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of
section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, a U.S. industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners have stated that they have standing to file the petitions because they are interested parties, as
defined under sections 771(9)(C) and 771(9)(D) of the Act, and because the petitions were filed on behalf of the U.S.
industry producing the product subject to these investigations. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs
(C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, these petitions,
it should file a written notification with the Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Department's regulations, any producer or reseller seeking exclusion from a potential antidumping duty
order must submit its request for exclusion within 30 days of the date of the publication of this notice. The procedures
and requirements are contained in 19 CFR 353.14. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Period of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The period of investigation is July 1, 1993 to December 31, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of Investigations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of these investigations, the term ``stainless steel bar'' means articles of stainless steel in straight
lengths that have been either hot-rolled, forged, turned, cold-drawn, cold-rolled or otherwise cold-finished,
or ground, having a uniform solid cross section along their whole length in the shape of circles, segments of circles,
ovals, rectangles (including squares), triangles, hexagons, octagons or other convex polygons. Stainless steel
bar includes cold-finished stainless steel bars that are turned or ground in straight lengths, whether produced
from hot-rolled bar or from straightened and cut rod or wire, and reinforcing bars that have indentations, ribs, grooves,
or other deformations produced during the rolling process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Except as specified above, the term does not include stainless steel semi-finished products, cut length flat-rolled
products (i.e., cut length rolled products which if less than 4.75 mm in thickness have a width measuring at least 10
times the thickness, or if 4.75 mm or more in thickness having a width which exceeds 150 mm and measures at least twice
the thickness), wire (i.e., cold-formed products in coils, of any uniform solid cross section along their whole length,
which do not conform to the definition of flat-rolled products), and angles, shapes and sections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The stainless steel bar subject to these investigations is currently classifiable under subheadings 7222.10.00,
7222.20.00 and 7222.30.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading
is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of these investigations is
dispositive.

Petitioners based United States price (USP) on January&hyph;March 1993 invoices issued by the U.S. subsidiary of
Acos Villares SA (Villares), a Brazilian producer of stainless steel bar, to an unrelated U.S. customer. Since USP
was based on C&amp;F terms of sale, petitioners deducted from USP amounts for U.S. duty, ocean freight, marine insurance,
and harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners used Villares' delivered home market prices as the basis for FMV. These prices and related expenses were
contained in a market research report. FMV was based on actual tax-exclusive, May&hyph;June 1993 delivered sales
prices of Villares to unrelated customers in Brazil. Petitioners deducted from FMV an amount for inland freight.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners indicate that the home market price used for FMV was reported in U.S. dollars, thus taking into account
Brazil's hyperinflationary economy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the dumping margin alleged by petitioners for stainless steel bar from Brazil is
19.43 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners calculated USP based on two different methodologies. First, petitioners obtained a July 1993 U.S. price
quote for stainless steel bar from India to an unrelated U.S. customer. Since the prices were quoted C&amp;F for delivery
to the east or west coast of the United States, petitioners deducted from USP amounts for import duties, ocean freight,
marine insurance, and harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners calculated a second weighted-average USP using the average import values of stainless steel bar from
India for August and September 1993. The unit values were derived from U.S. Department of Commerce import statistics.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners used Indian home market prices for stainless steel bar from Mukand Ltd., the largest stainless steel
bar producer in India, as the basis for FMV. These prices were contained in a market research report. Petitioners deducted
from these prices taxes, insurance, freight, and a distributor's margin based on information in the market research
report. Because the comparison of USP and FMV involved non-identical merchandise, petitioners made an adjustment
for differences in merchandise based on information contained in the market research report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of this initiation, we have accepted petitioners' calculation of USP based on the first methodology.
Accordingly, the range of dumping margins of stainless steel bar from India based on a comparison of USP to FMV alleged
by petitioners under this methodology is 11.26 to 21.02 percent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners based USP on price quotations for U.S. sales made by Cogne, an Italian producer of stainless steel bar,
to an unrelated U.S. customer. Since these USPs were quoted FOB duty paid, petitioners deducted the applicable import
duties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners calculated FMV using two methodologies. First, petitioners used Cogne's delivered home market prices
as the basis for FMV. These prices were contained in a market research report. Petitioners deducted from these prices
inland freight and insurance based on information contained in the same report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, petitioners based FMV on constructed value (CV). Petitioners used CV because they alleged that Cogne's home
market sales are being made at prices below the cost of production (COP). Petitioners also allege that another Italian
company, Bolzano, is making home market sales of stainless steel bar at prices below the COP. These allegations are
based on a comparison of home market prices for Cogne and Bolzano, obtained from the market research report, with COP.
COP was based on the COP of an efficient U.S. producer of stainless steel bar, adjusted for known differences in costs
between the United States and Italy. Where petitioners calculated CV, they used the COP derived from this U.S. producer
and added the statutory minimum of eight percent for profit.

Petitioners based USP on June 1993 sales invoices from Daido Steel Sheet Corporation (Daido), a Japanese producer
of stainless steel bar, to an unrelated U.S. customer. Since the USPs were quoted ex-dock, duty paid, Los Angeles,
petitioners deducted from USP amounts for U.S. duty, ocean freight, marine insurance, harbor maintenance and U.S.
merchandise processing fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners used Daido's delivered May&hyph;June 1993 home market sales prices as the basis for FMV. These prices
were contained in a market research report. To calculate an ex-factory price, except for credit, petitioners used
expense information from the market research report. For credit, petitioners used the rate in effect in Japan for
March 1993 as reported in the International Financial Statistics, July 1993. Petitioners deducted from FMV an amount
for inland freight and insurance, trade discounts, rebates and sales promotion expenses, advertising and warranties.
Petitioners made circumstance-of-sale adjustments for credit and packing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a comparison of USP to FMV, the dumping margins alleged by petitioners for stainless steel bar from Japan range
from 48.00 to 61.47 percent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Petitioners based USP on a September 1993 price quote for U.S. sales made by Acenor, a Spanish producer of stainless
steel bar, to an unrelated U.S. company. Since USP was quoted on a direct mill delivery basis, petitioners deducted
the applicable import duties, ocean freight, marine insurance, harbor maintenance and U.S. merchandise processing
fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners calculated FMV using two methodologies. First, petitioners used Acenor's delivered home market prices
as the basis for FMV. These prices were contained in a market research report. Petitioners deducted inland freight
from FMV using information contained in the same report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, petitioners based FMV on CV because they alleged that Acenor's home market sales are being made at prices below
the COP. Petitioners also allege that another Spanish company, Roldan, is making home market sales of stainless steel
bar at prices below the COP. These allegations are based on a comparison of home market prices for Acenor and Roldan,
obtained from the market research report, with COP. COP was based on the COP of an efficient U.S. producer, adjusted
for known differences in costs between the United States and Spain. Where petitioners calculated CV, they used the
COP from this producer and added the statutory minimum of eight percent for profit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Department is initiating COP investigations for the two companies where petitioners provided company-specific

is not initiating COP investigations for those companies and exporters where petitioners did not provide company-specific
home market prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners allege a price-to-price dumping margin for stainless steel bar from Spain of 38.82 percent. Petitioners
allege a price-to-CV dumping margin of 144.88 percent.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have examined the petitions on stainless steel bar from Brazil, India, Italy, Japan and Spain, and have found that
the petitions meet the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations
to determine whether imports of stainless steel bar from Brazil, India, Italy, Japan and Spain are being, or are likely
to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value.

Preliminary Determination by the International Trade Commission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The International Trade Commission (ITC) will determine by February 14, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication
that imports of stainless steel bar from Brazil, India, Italy, Japan and Spain are materially injuring, or threaten
material injury to, a U.S. industry. A negative ITC determination on any one of these investigations will result in
that investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigations will proceed according to statutory and regulatory
time limits.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Chapter 19 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism to replace
domestic judicial review of final determinations in antidumping and countervailing duty cases involving imports
from the other country with review by independent binational panels. When a Request for Panel Review is filed, a panel
is established to act in place of national courts to review expeditiously the final determination to determine whether
it conforms with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the country that made the determination.

Under Article 1904 of the Agreement, which came into force on January 1, 1989, the Government of the United States and
the Government of Canada established Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational Panel Reviews (``Rules'').
These Rules were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53212). The Rules were amended by Amendments to the Rules of Procedure for Article 1904 Binational
Panel Reviews, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 27, 1989 (54 FR 53165). The Rules were further amended and a consolidated version of the amended Rules was
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 15, 1992 (57 FR 26698). The panel review in this matter was conducted in accordance with these Rules.

On August 16, 1993, the Binational Panel remanded the final determination to the Department of Commerce for action
not inconsistent with the Panel's decision as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commerce was asked to reconsider the exercise of its statutory discretion as to whether its disproportionality analysis
should be conducted on an enterprise or industry basis, and provide the Panel a cogent explanation why it exercised
its discretion in a given manner; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning the appropriate allocation period for grants given to Norsk Hydro for the purchase of pollution control
equipment, Commerce was asked to consider the IRS tables and the producer records, in a manner that satisfies the standard
articulated in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 case of ``an allocation period which will accurately reflect the commercial and competitive benefit received by
the plaintiffs in this case,'' and to provide a satisfactory explanation for its reasoning in support of whatever
decision it reaches.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 16, 1993, the Binational Panel issued a decision which affirmed in part and remanded in part the final affirmative
countervailing duty determination of the United States Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration
(``ITA'') concerning Pure and Alloy Magnesium from Canada. The panel remanded the ITA's determination in two respects:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) For the ITA to explain why, in determining the specificity of the SDI program subsidy, the ITA conducted its ``disproportionality''
analysis on an enterprise-by-enterprise basis rather than on an industry-by-industry basis; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For the ITA to explain why its use of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) depreciation tables for the useful life of equipment
in the industry accurately reflects the commercial and competitive benefits received by Norsk Hydro Canada from
grants it received for the purchase of pollution control equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The panel instructed ITA to provide its redetermination on remand within 30 days (by Sepember 16).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ITA submitted its redetermination on remand on September 15, 1993, which the Panel Affirmed in all respects. The
Secretariat was instructed to issue a Notice of Completion of Panel Review on the 31st day following the issuance of
the Order, if no Request for an Extraordinary Challenge was filed. No such request was filed. Therefore, on the basis
of the Panel Order and Rule 80 of the Article 1904 Panel Rules, the Panel Review was completed and the panelists discharged
from their duties effective January 14, 1994.

In a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated January 17, 1994 between the Governments of the United States and the
People's Republic of China agreement was reached to establish a new bilateral textile and apparel agreement for three
consecutive one-year periods, beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1996.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to establish limits for the
period beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public should also be aware that the two Governments agreed to establish limits on wearing apparel containing
70 percent or more by weight of silk. These limits will be implemented on March 1, 1994. A notice will appear in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing the limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Army is investigating the feasibility of filling part of its training requirements from vocational graduate
resources. If the Army can recruit applicants who are already trained in specific career areas, it can save training
resources and provide units with trained soldiers faster. This study investigates the propensity of vocational
students to enlist, as well as the incentives required to induce them to enlist.

between the Federal Government, domestic manufacturers, marketers, and potential users of renewable energy *&blank;*&blank;*
technologies.'' Without this partnership, the availability of these technologies for domestic industry could
be substantially delayed.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As defined in the Act, an emerging RE technology is one that has already been proven to work, but which has not been commercialized
or has been limited to sub-commercial demonstration or quantities, to restricted or controlled operation, or to
only selected applications. Awards under the solicitation will be Grants or Cooperative Agreements (depending
on the scope of the project and need for substantial DOE involvement) administered in accordance with 10 CFR 600, DOE's
Financial Assistance Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following are RE areas that DOE will consider for financial assistance under the solicitation:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

sufficient scale or size likely to encourage private investment in commercial facilities or systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Market introduction activities of a product or service having potentially high energy payoff and/or high
replication value by other users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Financial support that will reduce risk for, or otherwise enable, private financing of a new venture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Financial assistance that will enable private sector investment in new RE manufacturing, evaluation and
test, or quality control facilities leading to commercial product introduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Project Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While not a requirement, DOE strongly encourages all parties interested in applying for financial assistance under
the Commercialization Ventures Program to respond to this notice by providing DOE with a short summary of the prospective
project. The primary use of these summaries by DOE will be to ensure that the overall Program adequately addresses
industry needs. In addition, DOE will review individual summaries in order to advise potential applicants on whether
their proposed project appears to fit within the overall objectives of the Commercialization Venture Program. DOE
will not evaluate individual project summaries on whether they meet any criteria for eventual award. All potential
applicants who submit a project summary will be advised in writing of whether the summary would seem to fit within the
Program or whether the summary seems to present a project that is unsuitable for the Program. If the latter, the potential
applicant will be advised of the reasons the potential project may be unsuitable. Project summaries submitted in
response to this notice should be received no later than 30 calendar days after the appearance of this notification
in order to be considered by DOE in formulating the solicitation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER) of the Office of Energy Research, U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) hereby announces its interest in receiving applications to support an experimental program in global climate
change, i.e., the measurement and analysis of radiation and cloud/radiation effects. This program is being pursued
in support of the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) and supports the goals of the DOE Atmospheric Radiation
Measurement (ARM) Program. Funding for this effort comes from both the Department of Defense (DoD) Strategic Environmental
Research and Development Program (SERDP) and from DOE. In the initial phases of this effort leased Unmanned Aerospace
Vehicles (UAV) will be instrumented and flights will be made in conjunction with ARM site activities. These initial
missions will emphasize measurement of the vertical flux profile in the troposphere and the use of UAV-based measurements
to calibrate satellite derived fluxes. Applications are sought to use the UAV-based data, in conjunction with ARM
site and other data, to address key issues in the radiative heating of the atmosphere; for the use, modification, or
development of UAV-compatible instruments for such radiation and cloud studies; to support instrument development;
and for data analysis which support integration of the UAV-borne instrument data with ARM site and other data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These efforts are intended to supply information for the global change scientific community and satisfy DoD SERDP

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of the ARM program is to improve the treatment of radiation and clouds in the models used to predict future
climate, particularly the General Circulation Models (GCM). (The role of clouds in climate change is the highest
science priority in the USGCRP.) The ARM program is one element of a major effort to improve the quality of current models
and to support the development of sets of climate models capable of making regional prediction of climate and climate
change. The major component of the ARM Program is an experimental testbed for the study of the terrestrial radiation
field, properties of clouds, the full life cycle of clouds, and the incorporation of process-level models into climate
models. This testbed is called the Clouds and Radiation Testbed (CART). The first ARM CART site began operation in
calendar year 1992 with instruments spread over approximately 60,000 square kilometers centered in Lamont, Oklahoma.
Sites planned for the Tropical Western Pacific Ocean and the North Slope of Alaska are expected to become operational
over the next four years. The present effort supports ARM objectives by providing for instrumentation, collection
and analysis of data on ARM relevant phenomena using UAVs as instrument platforms. The desirability of UAVs for this
research lies in their potential to remain on station or make long range tracks for extended periods (>48 hrs) and/or
to fly at altitudes slightly above the top of the troposphere. These advantages are achieved without concomitant
risk to pilot or crew. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The altitudes of interest for the present effort extend from about one thousand feet to the top of the troposphere.
The lower altitude is governed by safety and control factors and the upper altitude is expected to be adequate for the
study of most tropospheric and radiation budget investigations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although mission schedules are currently being developed, they are expected to be flexible_three UAV flight missions
are anticipated in the next 18 months. The first three missions will be over the Southern Great Plains ARM Site. These
early missions will emphasize measurement of the vertical radiation flux profile and the use of UAV-borne instruments
to calibrate satellite-derived measurements such as the top-of-the-atmosphere flux. The initial payloads include
up and down-looking, broadband solar and infrared, hemispherical flux radiometers; a nadir viewing spectral radiometer
covering the 0.4 to 4.0 microns; and a meteorology package (temperature, pressure, and water vapor measurements).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
{
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The goal of the first missions is measurement of the vertical radiation flux profile and they will be conducted with
instruments being integrated into payloads presently; these instruments include broad-band radiometers, a narrow
band radiometer, and a meteorology package (temperature, pressure and water vapor measurement).
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
}
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Later missions will be more flexible as to goals, mission profiles, and instrument payload. This notice requests
applications to support two categories of effort; analysis of data and development of UAV instruments in pursuit
of the experimental goals.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data analysis efforts should focus on making maximum use of UAV-derived data, in conjunction with CART and other data
sources, to address key radiative heating issues and to provide calibration/validation of satellite derived data
products. In addition, the investigators funded for these efforts are expected to assist in planning the future missions
to include locations, mission profiles, and instrument complement. Mission planning will be conducted by these
investigators, UAV instrument developers and interested members of the ARM science team, and the UAV mission planning
group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed instruments for the UAV missions should provide data relevant and of unique value to the mission's objectives.
Instruments should be compatible with use on a small UAV as part of a multi-instrument payload. Typically they should
weigh less than 30 kg, draw less than 100 W, and occupy less than 1.01m3. Instruments must be capable of autonomous operation
fully exposed to the ambient atmosphere. The UAV payload interface will provide power to the instrument through a
DC Bus (voltage negotiable) and will also provide for telemetering the data stream to the ground. Applications for
instrument development should include optimum conditions for taking data from the proposed instrument as well as
requirements for other instruments on-board or required from other platforms (e.g., the ARM site). The proposed
instruments will be subject to a review at six months after the award. A decision on which instruments to bring to operational
capability will be made at the six month review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that approximately $3.5M will be available for awards for these activities contingent on availability
of appropriated funds. Multiple year funding is expected, also contingent upon the availability of funds. The allocation
of funds will depend on the number and quality of applications received. Typical Environmental Sciences Division
awards are $200,000 per year, but range between $50,000 and $750,000.

The Commission is consulting with the New Hampshire State Historic Preservation Officer (hereinafter, SHPO) and
the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (hereinafter, Council) pursuant to 36 CFR 800.13 of the Council's
regulations implementing section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 470f), to
prepare a programmatic agreement for managing properties included on, or eligible for inclusion in, the National
Register of Historic Places at Project No. 2456.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The programmatic agreement, upon approval by the Commission, the SHPO, and the Council, would satisfy the Commission's
section 106 responsibilities for all individual undertakings carried out in accordance with the agreement until
the agreement expires or is terminated (36 CFR 800.13(e)). The Commission's section 106 requirements for the above
project would be fulfilled through a programmatic agreement for comments under section 106.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47910), the Office of Hydropower Licensing (OHL) has reviewed the
application for amendment of license to install a microturbine at the Boulder Creek Project. This project is located
on Boulder Creek in Garfield County, Utah. The staff of OHL's Division of Project Compliance and Administration prepared
an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the action. In the EA, the staff concludes that construction and operation of
the microturbine would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the EA are available for review in the Reference and Information Center, room 3308, of the Commission's offices

with respect to National's relationship with National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (Distribution), an affiliated
local distribution company. National claims that since its restructuring plan became effective on August 1, 1993,
Distribution is no longer a sales customer of National. Distribution, which is National's largest single transportation
customer, can make off-system sales without triggering the marketing affiliate rules, so long as the gas sold is not
transported on National's pipeline system. National requests that the Commission allow Distribution to move gas
through National's facilities to a newly created Hug, without triggering the requirements of Order Nos. 497

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47910), the Office of Hydropower Licensing (OHL) has reviewed the
licensee's post-licensing filing that proposes to modify the minimum flows from the project reservoir. The intent
of the proposed flow modification is to help protect fishery resources (primarily the chinook salmon) in the Tuolumne
River. Staff's initial evaluation was issued on December 22, 1993, in a draft environmental assessment (DEA). In
the DEA, staff determined that because some of the proposed alternatives could, under certain circumstances, reduce
the amount of water available to users of the Hetch Hetchy water supply, some of the proposed alternatives may constitute
a major federal action affecting the human environment and recommended preparation of an environmental impact statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A draft EIS will be issued and circulated for review by all interested parties. All comments filed on the draft EIS will
be analyzed by staff and considered in the final EIS. Staff's conclusions and recommendations will then be presented
for the consideration of the Commission in reaching its final decision.

in identifying the scope of environmental issues that should be analyzed in the EIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DEA will be considered the initial scoping document. Copies of the DEA are available in the Commission's Reference
and Information Center, room 3308, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.
Copies of the DEA will also be available at the scoping meeting.

Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This ICR is an extension of existing information collection activities required under the Federal Acquisition Regulations
(FAR) at 48 CFR 4.804 and 4.805. Under these regulations, EPA contractors completing cost-reimbursement contracts
must provide EPA with summary information of all costs incurred in the performance of the contract prior to contract
closure. Specifically, using EPA Form 1900&hyph;10 or an equivalent format, EPA contractors must provide EPA with
summary information on the major expenditures under the contract, such as direct labor, direct material and supplies,
equipment, travel, and subcontract costs. There are no recordkeeeping requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This information is used by the EPA to determine the final amount of reimbursable costs to the contractor. The EPA contracting
officer reviews and reconciles this information with EPA's internal records. After the information is verified
through this audit, a final payment is made to the contractor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments
of 1984, prohibits land disposal of hazardous wastes beyond specified dates unless the owner/operator of a hazardous
waste storage or disposal facility demonstrates to the Administrator of EPA that there will be no migration of hazardous
constituents from the land disposal unit for as long as the waste remains hazardous. The regulated community can petition
for a variance from statutory prohibitions or treatment requirements promulgated under section 3004, to continue
land disposal of specific hazardous wastes at specific facilities. The requirements for obtaining these variances
and the associated costs are discussed in detail in the ICR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Permits and State Programs Division, Office of Solid Waste, will review the petitions and determine if they successfully
demonstrate no migration. Granting of a variance will be based upon successful demonstration that hazardous wastes
can be managed safely in a particular land disposal unit, so that no migration of any hazardous constituents occurs
from the unit for as long as the waste remains hazardous. The statutory requirement for an application by an interested
person is intended to place the burden on the applicant to prove that a specified waste can be contained safely in a particular
type of disposal unit.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated January 17, 1994, the President declared a major disaster under the authority
of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of California, resulting from an earthquake and aftershocks
on January 17, 1994, and continuing, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major disaster declaration
under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I, therefore,
declare that such a major disaster exists in the State of California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes,
such amounts as you find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You are authorized to provide Individual Assistance and Public Assistance in the designated areas. Consistent with
the requirement that Federal assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for Public
Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the total eligible costs except for direct Federal assistance costs for
emergency work authorized at 100 percent Federal funding for the first 72 hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the authority vested in the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
under Executive Order 12148, I hereby appoint Frank L. Kiston of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to act as
the Federal Coordinating Officer for this declared disaster.

FDA public advisory committee meetings may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public hearing, (2)
an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation. Every advisory
committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of the other three
portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. There are no closed portions for the meetings announced
in this notice. The dates and times reserved for the open portions of each committee meeting are listed above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The open public hearing portion of each meeting shall be at least 1 hour long unless public participation does not last
that long. It is emphasized, however, that the 1 hour time limit for an open public hearing represents a minimum rather
than a maximum time for public participation, and an open public hearing may last for whatever longer period the committee
chairperson determines will facilitate the committee's work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public hearings are subject to FDA's guideline (subpart C of 21 CFR part 10) concerning the policy and procedures for
electronic media coverage of FDA's public administrative proceedings, including hearings before public advisory
committees under 21 CFR part 14. Under 21 CFR 10.205, representatives of the electronic media may be permitted, subject
to certain limitations, to videotape, film, or otherwise record FDA's public administrative proceedings, including
presentations by participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meetings of advisory committees shall be conducted, insofar as is practical, in accordance with the agenda published
in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. Changes in the agenda will be announced at the beginning of the open portion of a meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to make an oral presentation at the open public hearing portion
of a meeting shall inform the contact person listed above, either orally or in writing, prior to the meeting. Any person
attending the hearing who does not in advance of the meeting request an opportunity to speak will be allowed to make
an oral presentation at the hearing's conclusion, if time permits, at the chairperson's discretion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agenda, the questions to be addressed by the committee, and a current list of committee members will be available
at the meeting location on the day of the meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transcripts of the open portion of the meeting may be requested in writing from the Freedom of Information Office (HFI&hyph;35),

During the month of December 1993, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HHS Office of Inspector General imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusions in the cases set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When an exclusion is imposed, no program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is made to anyone for any items or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services (other than an emergency item or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service not provided in a hospital emergency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
room) furnished, ordered or prescribed by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded party under the Medicare, Medicaid, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maternal and Child Health Services Block 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grant and Block Grants to States for Social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Services programs. In addition, no program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment is made to any business or facility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e.g., a hospital, that submits bills for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment for items or services provided by an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded party. Program beneficiaries remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
free to decide for themselves whether they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will continue to use the services of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded party even though no program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payments will be made for items and services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by that excluded party. The exclusions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have national effect and also apply to all other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal non-procurement programs.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 9, 1993, the presiding administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a final initial determination (ID) in this
investigation. Ordinarily, final IDs are processed in accordance with the deadlines set forth in Commission interim
rules &sect;210.53&hyph;.56. In this investigation, however, the Commission determined to waive in part the application
of those interim rules and to apply instead a revised procedure, as set forth at 58 FR 63391 (Dec. 1, 1993). Accordingly,
the Commission ordered that consideration of the ALJ's final ID in this investigation would be according to a revised
procedure. Under the revised schedule, the parties were allowed to file petitions for review of the ID, responses
to the petitions for review, and replies to the responses by certain deadlines. The Commission also indicated that
it might later issue a notice requesting written submissions from the parties, other federal agencies, and interested
members of the public on the issues of remedy, the public interest, and bonding, and/or requiring the parties to file
supplemental briefs on violation issues selected by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the schedule previously announced, complainant filed a petition for review, respondents and
the Commission investigative attorney filed responses to the petition for review, and all parties filed reply submissions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has not yet completed its review of the record in this investigation and has made no determinations
with respect to the ID or complainant's petition for review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Commission finds a violation of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) in this investigation,
it could issue (1) an order that could result in the exclusion of the subject articles from entry into the United States,
and/or (2) cease and desist orders that could result in respondents being required to cease and desist from engaging
in unfair acts in the importation and sale of such articles. Accordingly, the Commission is interested in receiving
written submissions that address the form of remedy, if any, that should be ordered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Commission contemplates some form of remedy, it must consider the effects of that remedy upon the public interest.
The factors the Commission will consider include the effect that an exclusion order and/or cease and desist orders
would have on (1) the public health and welfare, (2) competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, (3) U.S. production
of articles that are like or directly competitive with those that are subject to investigation, and (4) U.S. consumers.
The Commission is therefore interested in receiving written submissions that address the aforementioned public
interest factors in the context of this investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Commission orders some form of remedy, the President has 60 days to approve or disapprove the Commission's action.
During this period, the subject articles would be entitled to enter the United States under a bond in an amount determined
by the Commission and prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission is therefore interested in receiving
written submissions concerning the amount of the bond that should be imposed, if any.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (``3M'') filed an amended complaint on June 30, 1993, pursuant to section
337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) alleging that three respondents: (1) Acurite Industries Corp.; (2) Fancy
International (HK) Ltd.; and (3) Charles Leonard, Inc. had violated section 337 in the importation into the United
States, the sale for importation, or the sale within the United States after importation of certain tape dispensers.
The tape dispensers were alleged to infringe the claim of U.S. Letters Patent Des. 289,180 (the '180 patent). On July
21, 1993, the Commission instituted this investigation by notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission terminated respondent Fancy International and amended the notice of investigation to add as respondents
Hoi Fung Industrial Company, Shiang Shin Trading Co., and Safina Office Products by notice published on November
10, 1993, at 58 FR 59735. The Commission terminated respondent Shiang Shin Trading Co. and changed the name of respondent
Safina Office Products to Shiang Shin International, Inc. d/b/a Safina Offfice Products by notice published on January
12, 1994 at 59 FR 1762. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 29, 1993, complainant 3M filed a motion for summary determination of violation of section 337 which was
unopposed. On December 23, 1993, the presiding ALJ issued her final ID finding that there was a violation of section
337. The ALJ found that the '180 patent was valid and infringed. The ALJ also found that a domestic industry exists with
respect to the patent claim in issue. No petitions for review or government agency comments were received by the Commission.
Having examined the record in this investigation, including the ID, the Commission determined not to review the ID,
thereby finding a violation of section 337. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In connection with final disposition of this investigation, the Commission may issue (1) An order that could result
in the exclusion of the subject articles from entry into the United States, and/or (2) cease and desist orders that
could result in respondents being required to cease and desist from engaging in unfair acts in the importation and
sale of such articles. Accordingly, the Commission is interested in receiving written submissions that address
the form of remedy, if any, that should be ordered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Commission contemplates some form of remedy, it must consider the effects of that remedy upon the public interest.
The factors the Commission will consider include the effect that an exclusion order and/or cease and desist orders
would have on (1) The public health and welfare, (2) competitive conditions in the U.S. economy, (3) U.S. production
of articles that are like or directly competitive with those that are subject to investigation, and (4) U.S. consumers.
The Commission is therefore interested in receiving written submissions that address the aforementioned public
interest factors in the context of this investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Commission orders some form of remedy, the President has 60 days to approve or disapprove the Commission's action.
During this period, the subject articles would be entitled to enter the United States under a bond, in an amount determined
by the Commission and prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Commission is therefore interested in receiving
submissions concerning the amount of the bond that should be imposed, if remedial orders are issued.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Indiana Rail Road Company (INRD) has agreed to grant CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), approximately 55 miles
of overhead trackage rights extending from the CSXT/INRD connection at Bloomington, IN, west to the CSXT/INRD connection
at Sullivan, IN. The trackage rights were to become effective on or after January 17, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The transaction is intended to make permanent a temporary detour arrangement. The detour was necessitated by a washout
of a portion of CSXT's rail line near Cloverdale, IN. By agreement, INRD will haul CSXT's cars in INRD trains between
Bloomington and Sullivan. CSXT will not exercise the trackage rights unless INRD is unable or unwilling to perform
the haulage services called for in their agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This notice and publication of General Administration Letter (GAL) No. 7&hyph;94 inform the States and cooperating
State agencies of the amendments to the Trade Act of 1974 in Title V of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182). These amendments affect the program of trade adjustment assistance
for workers and the administration of the program by the States pursuant to State agreements with the Secretary of
Labor. The amendments must be implemented as of the respective dates set out in Title V and contained in the GAL published
with this notice
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Title V amendments supersede the statute in effect prior to these amendments and affect the regulations at 20 CFR
part 617 and 29 CFR part 90 currently in effect, to the extent that such prior law and regulations are inconsistent with
the amendments. Pending the issuance of final regulations implementing the provisions of the Title V amendments,
the GAL published with this notice expresses the Department of Labor's position on procedures for implementation
of the amendments and their respective meanings, and constitutes operating instructions to the States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Title V amendments also require States to make available certain assistance and services authorized under Title
III of the Job Training Partnership Act to workers whom the Governor preliminarily finds to be adversely affected
by NAFTA. The GAL informs the States of this requirement, and of the potential for secondary workers in firms supplying
component parts to primary producers affected by NAFTA to receive assistance under the Title III program. Additional
information concerning the use of Title III funds to assist these workers and other individuals adversely affected
by NAFTA will be forthcoming.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 8, 1993, the President signed the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. The GAL relates
primarily to those provisions of Title V of the Act affecting the TAA Program. Most of the provisions of Title V are in
the form of amendments to Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act of 1974. Some of the provisions of Title V are not in the
form of amendments to the Trade Act, however, they nonetheless must be given effect in implementing the NAFTA&hyph;TAA
program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program is generally similar to the existing TAA program, it does differ in several ways:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Governors have a specific role in the new adjustment assistance program targeted to workers who may be displaced
because of trade with Canada or Mexico. State agencies also have new program responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Group eligibility requirements have been changed to address imports of articles from Mexico and Canada only and
to authorize the certification for NAFTA&hyph;TAA of worker groups when the workers' firm shifts production to Mexico
or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Workers are required to be enrolled in training to qualify for trade readjustment allowance (TRA) payments. Also,
individual workers must be enrolled in training within specified time periods to qualify for TRA after a worker group
is certified for NAFTA&hyph;TAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Adjustment assistance to workers adversely affected by NAFTA is also available under Title III of the JTPA. States
are responsible for assuring that certain assistance and services are made available to workers whom the Governor
preliminarily finds to be adversely affected by NAFTA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_Dislocated workers who are indirectly affected by NAFTA, e.g., workers in firms which supply components to a firm
whose final product is adversely affected by imports from Mexico or Canada, may seek under Title III assistance similar
to that available through the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program.

It is the Department's intention to publish for comment proposed regulations regarding implementation of the provisions
of Title V relating to transitional adjustment assistance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the provisions were effective on January 1, 1994, it is essential to inform the States and the cooperating
State agencies of the terms of the provisions and of the Department's instructions concerning the proper implementation
of these provisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Trade Act of 1974 made major changes to the trade adjustment assistance program for workers displaced because
of increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by the workers' firm. On receiving
a petition for trade adjustment assistance from a group of workers or its authorized representative, the Department
of Labor conducts a fact-finding investigation in response to the petition. If the findings substantiate that the
workers of a firm or subdivision of have been adversely affected by import competition, a certification is issued
by the Secretary of Labor to the worker group stating that the workers are eligible to apply at a local office of the State
employment security agency for TAA benefits. Benefits include up to 104 weeks of training in new occupational skills,
and job search assistance and relocation allowances when jobs are not available within the commuting area from the
worker's residence. Workers participating in training (unless the training requirement is waived) may also receive
up to 52 weeks of trade readjustment allowance (TRA) payments which are generally equivalent to the worker's unemployment
insurance payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations implementing the adjustment assistance program for workers in chapter 2, title II, of the Trade Act are
published at 20 CFR part 617.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 8, 1993, the President signed into law the ``North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.''
These implementing instructions relate only to those provisions of Title V affecting the TAA Program. Most of the
provisions of Title V are in the form of amendments to Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act of 1974, and while some of the
provisions of Title V are not in the form of amendments to the Trade Act, they nonetheless must be given effect in implementing
the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the NAFTA&hyph;TAA is generally similar to the existing TAA Program, it does differ in several ways. Governors
have a specific role in the new adjustment assistance program targeted to workers who may be displaced because of trade
with Canada or Mexico. State agencies also have new program responsibilities. The NAFTA&hyph;TAA program requires
workers to be enrolled in training to qualify for trade readjustment allowance (TRA) payments and does not allow the
waiver of the training requirement when training is not ``feasible or appropriate'', which is now available to eligible
workers in the regular TAA program. To provide for these differences, Section 502 of the Act adds a new Subchapter D_NAFTA
Transitional Adjustment Assistance Program, to Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act. Subchapter D adds one section_Section
250, Establishment of a Transitional Program_to Chapter 2, Title II of the Trade Act, creating the new NAFTA&hyph;TAA
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Adjustment assistance to workers adversely affected by NAFTA is also available under Title III of the JTPA. States
are responsible for providing assistance and services to workers whom the Governor preliminarily finds to be adversely
affected by NAFTA. In addition, dislocated workers who are indirectly affected by NAFTA, e.g., workers in firms which
supply components to a firm whose final product is adversely affected, may seek assistance similar to that available
through the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program. Effective delivery of these Title III funded services will require governors
to ensure close planning and coordination between the TAA and Title III program operators.

Operating Instructions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The operating instructions in this document are issued to the States and the cooperating State agencies as guidance
provided by the Department of Labor in its role as the principal in the TAA Program. As agents of the United States, the
States and cooperating State agencies may not vary from the operating instructions in this document without prior
approval from the Department of Labor (DOL).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pending the issuance of regulations implementing the provisions of Title V, the operating instructions in this document
shall constitute the controlling guidance for the States and the cooperating State agencies in implementing and
administering the new NAFTA&hyph;TAA program, pursuant to the agreements between the States and the Secretary of
Labor under Section 239 of the Trade Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Instructions for implementing the JTPA Title III component, including procedures for accessing the national reserve
funds to provide assistance to workers of secondary firms who are adversely affected by NAFTA, will be issued shortly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAFTA&hyph;TAA amendments are set out in this document according to the section number of the Trade Act affected by
each of the amendments. An explanation of each amendment is furnished with an explanation of the regulations principally
affected, and with additional instructions on the administration of each amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Establishment of Transitional Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 502 of the Act establishes a new Subchapter D in Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A.1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Group Eligibility Requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AMENDED LAW
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Subsection (a) of section 250 is titled Group Eligibility Requirements. Paragraph (1) of subsection (a) sets out
the criteria for certifying a worker group for NAFTA&hyph;TAA as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A group of workers (including workers in any agricultural firm or subdivision of an agricultural firm) shall be certified
as eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under subsection (b) if the Secretary determines that a significant
number or proportion of the workers in such workers' firm or an appropriate subdivision of the firm have become totally
or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated, and either_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) that_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) the sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm or
subdivision have increased, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the increase in imports under clause (ii) contributed importantly to such workers' separation or threat of
separation and to the decline in sales or production of such firm or subdivision; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) that there has been a shift in production by such workers' firm or subdivision to Mexico or Canada of articles like
or directly competitive with articles which are produced by the firm or subdivision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ADMINISTRATION
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. As mentioned above, paragraph (a)(1) sets out the group eligibility criteria for certifying worker groups for transitional
adjustment assistance. Two sets of criteria are included in subparagraphs (A) and (B). The criteria in subparagraph
(A) are similar to the eligibility criteria in the regular TAA program (section 222 of the Trade Act), except that the
criteria for NAFTA&hyph;TAA petitions provide that increased imports must come from Mexico or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, and without reference to whether there have been increased imports from Mexico or Canada under subparagraph
(A), the criterion under subparagraph (B) confers eligibility if the firm or subdivision of the firm has shifted production
to Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by the firm or subdivision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Application of Criteria:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of section 250, the following terms are applied:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appropriate subdivision
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an establishment in a multi-establishment firm which produces the domestic articles in question or a distinct
part or section of an establishment (whether or not the firm has more than one establishment) where the articles are
produced. The term ``appropriate subdivision'' includes auxiliary facilities operated in conjunction with (whether
or not physically separate from) production facilities. (OTAA has interpreted the term ``establishment'' to include
a place of business together with its employees, merchandise, equipment, etc.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Firm
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means an individual proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, association, corporation (including a development
corporation), business trust, cooperative, trustee in bankruptcy, and receiver under decree of any court. A firm,
together with any predecessor or successor-in-interest, or together with any affiliated firm controlled or substantially
beneficially owned by substantially the same persons, may be considered a single firm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Significant number or proportion of workers
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. In most cases the total or partial separations, or both, in a firm or appropriate subdivision thereof, are the equivalent
to a total unemployment of five (5) percent of the workers or 50 workers, whichever is less; or

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
b. At least three workers in a firm (or appropriate subdivision thereof) with a work force of fewer than 50 workers would
ordinarily have to be affected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Total or partial separation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All analyses of separations must treat total and partial separations equally.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Partial separation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means, with respect to an individual who has not been totally separated, that the worker's:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Hours of work have been reduced to 80 percent or less of the worker's average weekly hours at the firm or appropriate
subdivision thereof, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Wages have been reduced to 80 percent or less of the worker's average weekly wage at the firm or appropriate subdivision
thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Total separation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means the layoff or severance of an individual from a firm or an appropriate subdivision thereof.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria in Subparagraph (A):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The following guidance and definitions shall apply:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sales and production
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 data must be obtained from the subject firm for the current 12-month period and the previous 12-month period in order
to determine whether an absolute decrease in sales or production has occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Increased imports.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department's Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance (OTAA) will provide information based on available data
regarding imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by the firm or
subdivision of the firm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Like or directly competitive
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 means that ``like'' articles are those which are substantially identical in inherent or intrinsic characteristics
(i.e., materials from which the articles are made, appearance, quality, texture, etc.); and ``directly competitive''
articles are those which, although not substantially identical in their inherent or intrinsic characteristics,
are substantially equivalent for commercial purposes (i.e., adapted to the same uses and essentially interchangeable
therefor).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An imported article is ``directly competitive'' with a domestic article at an earlier or later stage of processing,
and a domestic article is ``directly competitive with'' an imported article at an earlier or later stage of processing,
if the importation of the article has an economic effect on producers of the domestic article comparable to the effect
of importation of articles in the same stage of processing as the domestic article.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criterion in Subparagraph (B):
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The criterion under subparagraph (B) breaks down into the following elements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Determination of article.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The article must be like or directly competitive with the article that has been produced in the U.S. by the subject firm
or subdivision of the firm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workers of firms that provide a service rather than produce an article are excluded from coverage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workers of firms that are suppliers of ``components'' related to the defined ``like or competitive article'' may
be covered only if those articles produced by such firms independently meet the eligibility criteria for certification
or the shift in production criterion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Action.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The article must have been formerly produced by a U.S. located firm or subdivision of the firm and is now produced in
Mexico or Canada. Since the law does not address ownership of the producing firm, the shift in production can be either
by the firm or subdivision moving the plant to Mexico or Canada, or the U.S. firm contracting with a different firm located
in Mexico or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A ``shift of production'' is defined to mean a tangible action or commitment to contract or license production of an
article within a definite period of time by the workers' firm with a firm in Mexico or Canada, including the actual production
of an article that was formerly produced by a U.S. located firm or subdivision, by a producing plant located in Mexico
or Canada.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition of Contributed Importantly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AMENDED LAW.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subparagraph (a)(2) of section 250 states that the term ``contributed importantly'' means a cause which is important
but not necessarily more important than any other cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ADMINISTRATION.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``contributed importantly'' is the same as used in section 222(b) of the Trade Act for administering the regular
TAA program. The ``contributed importantly'' provision is used by the Department of Labor in its review of petitions
for eligibility for the regular TAA Program and will also be used for the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program. Pursuant to section
250(b)(2)(B)(i), Governors, when making a preliminary finding as to whether a petition meets the eligibility requirements
for NAFTA&hyph;TAA, discussed above, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
will not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 apply the ``contributed importantly'' test when reviewing NAFTA&hyph;TAA petitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the Governor or the designated State official substantiates that the criteria in clauses (i) and (ii) of sections
250(a)(1)(A) have been met, the petition package including a statement of affirmative preliminary finding is forwarded
to the OTAA for review. To confirm the State's affirmative preliminary finding, the OTAA will apply the criteria in
section 250(a)(1)(A), including the ``contributed importantly'' test in clause (iii).

 Because of the time constraints for implementing the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program on January 1, 1994, regulations will
not be in place until after this date. Accordingly, to begin operation of the program, operating instructions will

A new petition form has been designed for use by worker groups to file petitions for NAFTA&hyph;TAA. The NAFTA&hyph;TAA
petition form will include a space in the filing instructions on the reverse side to permit the State to add the address
of where the petitions are to be filed. A supply of the NAFTA&hyph;TAA petition forms will be furnished to each State.
States should reproduce the NAFTA&hyph;TAA petition form to meet its needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the NAFTA&hyph;TAA petition form with the address for filing the petition are to be made available by the
States, at a minimum, in every local employment service and unemployment insurance office. Staff in local offices
must be familiar with the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program, as well as the regular TAA program, and the procedures being put
in place to assure that workers applying for employment services and unemployment insurance benefits are advised
properly regarding both TAA programs and on filing the proper petition form to the correct location.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NAFTA&hyph;TAA petition forms will be submitted to the State official or organization designated by the Governor
to review such petitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Worker petitions for the regular TAA program will continue to be submitted directly to the Department of Labor's Office
of Trade Adjustment Assistance, at the address on the reverse side of the form.

Day 1:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The Governor receives a petition for NAFTA&hyph;TAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State records the receipt date on the face of the petition, reviews the petition for completeness and clarity,
and telephones the company official listed as the contact person on the petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Telephone contact with the company official is to cover the following:

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(1) Determine if the official listed on the petition is the appropriate contact. If not, show the name, telephone number
and FAX number (if available) of the appropriate contact person on the face of the petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Confirm the product description reported on the petition. Accuracy is critical to DOL in determining whether
imports of like or directly competitive products have increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Ask the company official about total and partial worker separations at the firm during the past 12 months. If there
were separations, ascertain if it was because of increased company imports from Mexico or Canada, an actual or threatened
shift of production to either country, or lost sales to customers to purchase from firms importing from Mexico or Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Alert company official that data request forms will be sent by FAX (if available) or by mail, and obtain the official's
cooperation to supply the requested information within 5 days of petition receipt. If the company official fails
to cooperate, inform the company of subpoena authority to obtain the requested data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the company continues to refuse to supply the data, the State must notify the company in writing of its subpoena authority
and determine if the data is to be furnished. Subpoena procedures should be instituted when there is non-compliance
with the request. TAA program regulations at 20 CFR 617.53 provide that States may issue subpoenas for attendance
of witnesses and production of records on the same terms and conditions as under State law. If a State court declines
to enforce a subpoena, the State agency may petition for an order requiring compliance with such subpoena to the United
States District Court within the jurisdiction of which the relevant proceeding under 20 CFR part 617 is conducted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Obviously, encouraging company cooperation is the best solution to obtaining requested information. Use of subpoena
procedures often result in lengthy legal negotiations and even court proceedings. Notify OTAA when subpoena procedures
are being considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Use the dedicated line (telephone number 202&hyph;501&hyph;6489) to FAX to OTAA the face page of the petition
form as well as any corrections or additions obtained during telephone contacts with the company official. This action
will serve as notification to the Secretary that the Governor has received a petition and that the investigation has
been initiated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) FAX (if available) or mail the data request forms, which include a request for a listing of company customers, to
the company official, specifying a due date for the information to be returned via FAX or mail. If appropriate, inform
the State employment security agency that an investigation is underway.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) OTAA will check its records for duplicate petitions and assign a NAFTA&hyph;TAA number to the case. OTAA will enter
the case number in the OTAA Management Information System and institute the investigation of the petition. A notice
of the investigation will be forwarded for publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the regional offices and State agencies notified according to established procedures in the regular TAA Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) OTAA will begin the analysis of aggregate U.S. imports for the article(s) listed in the petition that are like or
directly competitive with the article(s) produced at the subject firm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Day 3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OTAA will complete the aggregate import analysis and FAX a determination to the State as to whether relevant imports
from Mexico or Canada have increased. This determination will be made part of the case file as it will be used by the State
in making its preliminary finding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Day 5
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the data package has not been received from the company official, the State will contact the company official to
urge completion and transmittal by mail or FAX (if available) of the data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Day 10
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. State will make a preliminary finding regarding whether the petition meets the criteria in section 250(a)(1),
except clause (A)(iii), and will prepare a brief statement on the basis for the finding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. State will FAX the petition face sheet, the data packet (including the customer list), and the preliminary finding
and reasons for the finding, to OTAA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. State will notify the petitioners of the Governor's preliminary finding on the NAFTA&hyph;TAA petition and that
the petition package is being submitted to the Secretary of Labor for review and final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. When an affirmative determination is made, the State will take the necessary action to ensure that the JTPA Title

available to the impacted workers.

If the affirmative preliminary finding from the State is not based on a shift in production to Mexico or Canada by the

 The administration of the benefit provisions of the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program is similar to the regular TAA program
except that the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program requires workers to be enrolled in training to qualify for TRA payments. The
NAFTA&hyph;TAA program prohibits the waiver of the training requirement when training is not ``feasible or appropriate,''
which is available to eligible workers in the regular TAA program. Also, the NAFTA&hyph;TAA program requires workers
to be enrolled in training by prescribed time periods to qualify for TRA.

The Act provides that payments for NAFTA&hyph;TAA training for any fiscal year shall not exceed $30 million. With
regard to this funding limitation, the Department will track nationally the amount of program funds allocated to

 For purposes of this provision, a worker shall be considered to be enrolled in training when the worker's application

Extenuating Circumstances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Act provides that the Secretary, for justifiable cause, may extend the time for enrollment for a period not to exceed
30 days. It is anticipated that there will be situations beyond the worker's control where the worker is unable to enroll
in training by the later of the last day of the 16th week of the worker's initial benefit period or the 6th week after the
week that a certification was issued. Such situations could involve training programs that are abruptly canceled
or circumstances where the first available enrollment date is past the deadline, as well as injury or illness which
may adversely affect the ability of workers to enroll in training. The authority to grant 30-day extensions to workers
is delegated to States or State agencies as one of their responsibilities under section 239 of the Trade Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application of this 30-day grace period will be used only in rare circumstances. Workers who fail to enroll in training
by the end of this 30-day period are still eligible to participate in approved training and have the training costs
paid with NAFTA&hyph;TAA program funds but will not qualify for TRA. This provision places added responsibilities
on both the worker and the State agency to satisfy the time limits for enrolling in training in order to qualify for TRA.
Workers certified for NAFTA&hyph;TAA must be informed promptly of the time provisions by the State agency when a NAFTA&hyph;TAA
certification is issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to satisfy these provisions, information bulletins or brochures furnished to claimants by the State unemployment
insurance agency and to applicants for employment services should include information on the time provisions for
NAFTA&hyph;TAA certified workers to qualify for TRA. Other means of informing workers of the time limits are through
newspaper notices and letters sent to individual workers when a certification is issued, as required in section 225
of the Trade Act and regulations at 20 CFR 617.4.

Although the use of brochures, newspaper notices and individual letters are important resources for informing workers
of the time provision for enrolling in training, they do not relieve States of their responsibility for helping workers
enroll in a training program in a timely manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State agencies shall follow existing funding a precertification procedures for NAFTA&hyph;TAA program petitions
now used for regular TAA Program petitions. Initiation of fact-finding investigations in response to NAFTA&hyph;TAA
petitions will be announced through publication of the information in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in the same manner as regular TAA petitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under precertification responsibilities, State agencies must obtain information from the subject firm about layoffs
beginning on and after December 8, 1993, including the names and social security numbers of the affected workers.
The State agency staff shall also follow the procedures used for the regular TAA Program to check UI files, flag appropriate
claims, and maintain coordination between the UI and ES offices to ensure that workers are enrolled in approved training
within the statutory time frames so they are not denied TRA eligibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This change is needed because of the addition of subchapter D in Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act. The impact of this
amendment is to require that the same types of benefit information be furnished by State agencies to workers applying
for unemployment insurance and to workers certified for NAFTA&hyph;TAA as are required by the regular TAA program.

 Subsection (c) of section 503 amends subchapter C of Chapter 2, Title II, of the Trade Act by adding a new section 249A

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This new section is intended to eliminate duplication of assistance and benefits to a worker in situations where a
worker group is certified concurrently for both regular TAA and NAFTA&hyph;TAA. These situations should be uncommon.
However, should this occur, the worker will be provided benefits under one or the other certification. The worker
is to make the decision regarding which certification will apply. Once a decision is made by the worker, it cannot be
changed. Also, State agency staff must explain the differences between programs so workers can make an informed choice.

. In determining the eligibility of workers for benefits under NAFTA&hyph;TAA, consideration must be given to the
date a worker is separated from employment. A worker whose last total or partial separation from a firm occurred after
the enactment of Pub. L. 103&hyph;182 on December 8, 1993, but before the date of entry into force of NAFTA (which is
anticipated to be on January 1, 1994), may be eligible for certification under the ``reachback'' provision in section

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Workers whose total or partial separation occurred at an earlier time must petition under the regular TAA program

the date of the petition on which a certification of eligibility is issued to qualify for services and benefits.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed meetings are for the purpose of panel review, discussion, evaluation and recommendation on applications
for financial assistance under the National Foundation on the Arts the Humanities Act of 1965, as amended, including
discussion of information given in confidence to the agency grant applicants. Because the proposed meetings will
consider information that is likely to disclose: (1) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained
from a person and privileged or confidential; or (2) information of a personal nature the disclosure of which would
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, pursuant to authority granted me by the Chairman's
Delegation of Authority to Close Advisory Committee meetings, dated July 19, 1993, I have determined that these meetings
will be closed to the public pursuant to subsections (c)(4), and (6) of section 552b of title 5, United States Code.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-33 and DPR-68 issued to the Tennessee Valley Authority
(the license) for operation of the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant (BFN) Units 1 and 3, located in Limestone County, Alabama.

Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is in response to the licensee's application dated September 2, 1993, with additional information
provided on December 17, 1993, for exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical
protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage.'' Under the proposed
exemption, the licensee would be relieved of requirements to provide positive containment access control by a guard
or watchman during periods of frequent access. BFN Units 1 and 3 have been shut down since March 1985 for modifications
required to put the units in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. The proposed exemption would be
in effect until immediately before the licensee loads fuel in the reactors when the required modifications are completed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, paragraph (a), the licensee shall establish and maintain an outside physical protection
system and security organization. Containment access controls specified by 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) require that any
time frequent access to the containment is required, positive controls are maintained by a guard or watchman to assure
only authorized personnel or materials are permitted into the containment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BFN Units 1 and 3 have been defueled since September 1985 and February 1987, respectively. These reactors have been
shut down since March 1985 for modifications required to put the units in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
A substantial number of the required modifications require frequent containment access. Therefore, the licensee
has maintained a guard at a controlled access location to fulfill the requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee believes that the 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) requirements are too restrictive, given the unique status of Browns
Ferry Units 1 and 3 and the other controls which are or will be exercised to ensure the reactors are returned to service
in a safe manner. Presently, the reactors are defueled, which reduces the radiological hazard potential within the
containment such that sabotage could not create a substantial offsite radiation dose. The licensee will perform
extensive return-to-service testing on all safety-related systems. This testing ensures that plant components
can properly perform their intended design functions. After modifications are completed, the licensee will also
perform security inspections to detect sabotage or introduction of foreign material which may have occurred during
the recovery effort.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(8) is required to permit the licensee to relax containment access controls during
the recovery of Browns Ferry Units 1 and 3. The proposed exemption will not reduce requirements for containment access
controls for Browns Ferry Unit 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee has indicated that during the period of the exemption, the reactors will be maintained in a defueled condition.
Postulated radiological sabotage within the containment in this condition cannot result in significant offsite
radiation doses. Therefore, the environmental impact of this sabotage is negligible. There is no other change in
environmental impact while the reactors are defueled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee has also indicated that, as the reactors are refueled and returned to service, it will perform extensive
testing and inspections which will detect latent sabotage which could adversely impact plant operations. The licensee
will test safety-related systems as they are returned to service to assure they are capable of fulfilling their design
functions. The licensee will also perform security inspections to determine if unauthorized and potentially dangerous
materials such as explosives have been introduced. These measures provide confidence that the reactors will operate
as intended by their design. Therefore, the environmental impact of plant operations after the period of the exemption
is unchanged from normally anticipated conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission concludes that granting the proposed exemption would result in no significant radiological
environmental impact. With regard to potential non-radiological impacts the proposed exemption does not affect
non-radiolgical plant effluents and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that
there are no significant non-radiological impacts associated with the proposed exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative to the Proposed Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the staff has concluded that there is no significant environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption,
any alternative to the exemption will have either no significantly different environmental impact, or greater environmental
impact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption. Denial of the exemption would result in no change
in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed exemption and this alternative are
similar.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action did not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the ``Final Environmental Statement,
Browns, Ferry Nuclear Plant Units 1, 2, and 3,'' dated September 1, 1972.

Finding of No Significant Impact

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based
upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant effect
on the quality of the human environment.

<DOCTITLE>Illinois Power Co., et al., Clinton Power Station, Unit 1; Proposed Corporate Restructuring</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering approval
under 10 CFR 50.80 of the proposed corporate restructuring of Illinois Power Company (IP), the owner and licensee
for the Clinton Power Station, Unit 1. By letter dated November 11, 1993, Sidley &amp; Austin, acting as counsel to
IP, informed the Commission that the Board of Directors has proposed a corporate restructuring plan to be presented
at the February 9, 1994, annual shareholders meeting. If a majority of IP shareholders approve the plan, IP will become
a wholly-owned subsidiary of a new holding company, IP Holding Company, effective on or about April 1, 1994. IP would
remain as holder of the license for the Clinton Power Station. If the plan is approved, the common stock of IP will be
converted on a share-for-share basis into common stock of the holding company. According to the proposed plan, the
current IP Board of Directors will serve in the same capacity for the holding company, and there will be no significant
change in ownership, management, or sources of funds for operation of the Clinton Power Station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.80, the Commission may approve the transfer of control of a license, after notice to interested
persons. Such action is contingent upon the Commission's determination that the holder of the license following
the transfer is qualified to have the control of the license and that the transfer of such control is otherwise consistent
with applicable provisions of law, regulations and orders of the Commission.

To achieve the Committee's goals, members will be appointed that can represent effectively the interests of individual
investors with respect to a range of issues. The Committee's membership may include, among others, individuals representing
consumer or investor organizations, securities market participants, securities market professionals, regulatory
entities and the public at large. The Commission expects that the Committee's members will represent a variety of
viewpoints and have varying experience and that the Committee will be fairly balanced in terms of points of view, backgrounds
and tasks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee will conduct its operations in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The duties of the

matters upon which the Committee provides advice will be made solely by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Committee will meet at such intervals as are necessary to carry out its functions. It is estimated the meetings
of the full Committee will occur approximately six times each year.

The Telecommunications Basket is a static portfolio consisting of 24 equity securities listed as: (1) Common shares
outside of the United States in the countries having the greatest exchange trading volume for the shares; (2) common
shares in the United States; or (3) as American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') in the United States. An ADR is a negotiable
receipt which is issued by a depositary, generally a bank, representing shares of a foreign issuer that have been deposited
and are held, on behalf of holders of the ADRs, at a custodian bank in the foreign issuer's home country. The securities
which comprise the Telecommunications Basket are securities issued by corporations formed under Argentina, Brazil,
Canada, Chile, France, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Spain, Sweden,
Thailand, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change states that: (i) if the entity that is used to calculate the value of the Telecommunications
Basket is required to use the bid and offer price for a portfolio security to determine the market price of such portfolio
security, then that entity shall not use any bid or offer price announced by Lehman Brothers or any affiliate of Lehman
Brothers; and (ii) Lehman Brothers will monitor the volatility of the Telecommunications Basket securities and
will discuss with the Commission the need to increase the frequency of portfolio value dissemination if the volatility
of the Telecommunications Basket increases materially. See Letter from John Riley, Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett,
to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated January

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 107 of the Exchange's Company Guide (``Guide''), the Amex may approve for listing securities which
can not be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures, and
warrants. The Amex is proposing to list for trading under section 107 of the Guide, Telecommunications Basket SUNS.

The Commission recently approved a proposed rule change submitted by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'')
for the listing and trading of two similar products: (1) Market Index Target Term Securities (``MITTS'') based upon
a global portfolio of securities representing telecommunications companies; and (2) MITTS based upon a portfolio
of securities of European companies.

The Telecommunications Basket SUNS will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 107 of the Guide, which provide
that issues must have: (1) A minimum public distribution of one million trading units; (2) a minimum of 400 shareholders;
and (3) a market value of at least $20 million. In addition, the listing guidelines provide that the issuer have assets
in excess of $100 million, and stockholder's equity of at least $10 million. In the case of an issuer which is unable
to satisfy the earnings criteria stated in section 101 of the Guide, the Exchange will require the issuer to have the
following: (1) Assets in excess of $200 million and stockholders' equity of at least $10 million; or (2) assets in excess
of $100 million and stockholders' equity of at least $20 million.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SUNS are non-callable senior hybrid debt securities of Lehman Brothers. SUNS will have a term of four to seven years
and will pay an annual coupon based on the annual appreciation of the Telecommunications Basket. At maturity, holders
of SUNS also will receive from the issuer the entire principal amount of the note. Telecommunications Basket SUNS
are cash-settled in that they do not give the holder any right to receive a portfolio security or any other ownership
right or interest in the portfolio securities, although the return on the investment is based on the aggregate portfolio
value of the Telecommunications Basket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Amex, Telecommunications Basket SUNS will allow investors to combine the protection of the principal
amount of the SUNS with potential additional payments based upon the performance of a portfolio of securities representing
24 highly capitalized global telecommunications companies. In particular, the proposed Telecommunications Basket
SUNS will provide 100% principal protection of the original issue price at maturity with the opportunity to participate
in any upside appreciation of the underlying Telecommunications Basket during the term of the note. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Telecommunications Basket consists of securities of 24 global telecommunications companies that have significantly
different levels of market capitalization, ranging from a high of approximately US$77.5 billion for American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph Company to a low of approximately US$616 million for Champion Technology.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The securities in the Telecommunications Basket include the common stock of five U.S. telecommunications companies,9

securities markets),10 ADRs of nine foreign issuers,11 and the ordinary shares of seven foreign issuers traded primarily
on or through non-U.S. securities markets.12 The average daily trading volume for the components of the Telecommunications
Basket for the period from August 1993, through October 1993, ranged from a high of approximately 2.4 billion shares
for Telecommunications Brasileiras S.A., to a low of approximately 45,000 shares for Tadiran. In addition, the public

At the outset, each of the securities in the Telecommunications Basket will have equal representation. Specifically,
each security included in the portfolio will be assigned a multiplier on the date of issuance so that the security represents
an equal percentage of the value of the entire portfolio on the date of issuance. The multiplier indicates the number
of shares (or fraction of one share) of a security, given its market price, to be included in the calculation of the portfolio.
Accordingly, each of the 24 companies included in the Telecommunications Basket will represent approximately 4.167%
of the total portfolio at the time of issuance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The multiplier for each security in the Telecommunications Basket will generally remain unchanged except for limited
adjustments that may be necessary as a result of stock splits or stock dividends.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 There will be no adjustments to the multipliers to reflect cash dividends paid with respect to a portfolio security.
In addition, no adjustments of any multiplier of a portfolio security will be made unless such adjustment would require
a change of at least 1% in the multiplier then in effect.

Lehman Brothers will adjust the multiplier of any Telecommunications Basket security if the security is subject
to a stock split or reverse split or similar adjustment in the case of an ADR, to equal the product of the number of shares
issued with respect to one share of the Telecommunications Basket security, or the number of receipts issued with
respect to an ADR, and the prior multiplier. In the case of a stock dividend, the multiplier will be adjusted so that
the new multiplier will equal the former multiplier plus the product of the number of shares of such portfolio security
issued with respect to one share of the portfolio security and the prior multiplier. In the case of a listing of ADRs
on a national securities exchange in the United States or on NASDAQ/NMS, the multiplier will be adjusted so that the
new multiplier will equal the conversion of ordinary shares to ADRs. The listed ADRs then will be used to calculate
the value of the Telecommunications Basket.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the issuer of a security included in the Telecommunications Basket no longer exists, whether for reason of a merger,
acquisition or similar type of corporate control transaction, then Lehman Brothers will assign to that security
a value equal to the security's final value for the purposes of calculating portfolio values. For example, if a company
included in the Telecommunications Basket is acquired by another company, Lehman Brothers shall thereafter assign
a value to the share of the acquired company's securities equal to the value per share at which time the acquisition
takes place. If the issuer of a portfolio security is in the process of liquidation or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding,
insolvency, or other similar adjudication, such security will continue to be included in the Telecommunications
Basket so long as a market price for such security is available. If a market price is no longer available for a portfolio
security, including, but not limited to, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency, or any other similar proceeding,
then the value of the portfolio security will be assigned a value of zero in connection with calculating the daily portfolio
value and the closing portfolio value of the Telecommunications Basket, for so long as no market price exists for that
security.

The value of the Telecommunications Basket will initially be calculated once a day either by an affiliate of Lehman
Brothers or by an independent calculation agent (``Pricing Agent''). These values will be disseminated to investors
once a day after 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. The portfolio value, for any day, will equal the sum of the products
of the most recently available market prices and the applicable multipliers for the portfolio securities.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, if the Pricing Agent is an affiliate of Lehman Brothers, Lehman Brothers has undertaken to implement
certain surveillance and compliance procedures with respect to the dissemination of the portfolio value, requiring
that the portfolio value be announced only through public dissemination and restricting the access of the affiliate's
trading desk to the portfolio value determined by the affiliate.

 note 7). Specifically, the market price used for calculation of the portfolio value is the last reported sale price
if the portfolio security is listed and traded on a national securities exchange, or is traded through NASDAQ/NMS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the portfolio security is a security of a foreign issuer or is an ADR that is not listed on a national securities exchange
in the U.S. or is not a NASDAQ/NMS security, then the market price is the last reported sale price on the securities exchange
on which the portfolio security is listed having the greatest volume of trading for the preceding calendar month as
determined by the Pricing Agent, provided that if such last reported sale price is for a transaction that occurred
more than 4 hours prior to the close of such exchange, then the market price is the average of the last available bid and
offer price on such exchange.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a foreign-issued portfolio security is not listed or trading on any securities exchange or if the last reported
sale price or bid and offer are not obtainable, then the market price is the last reported sale price on the over-the-counter
(``OTC'') market with the greatest volume of trading as determined by the Pricing Agent. However, if such last reported
sale price is for a transaction which occurred more than 4 hours prior to when trading in such OTC market typically ends,
then the market price is the average of the last available bid and offer price of the three most active dealers, as selected
by the Pricing Agent. See Letter from John Riley, Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office
of Derivatives Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated January 13, 1994 (``January 13 Letter'').

If the Pricing Agent is required to use the bid and offer price for a portfolio security to determine the market price

Telecommunications Basket SUNS will be denominated in U.S. dollars and will entitle holders to receive annual coupon
payments based upon the percentage change in the value of the Telecommunications Basket from the beginning to the
end of the year. If the market value of the portfolio has declined, the holder will receive not less than 100% of the original
principal amount of the security. Like the MITTS listed on the NYSE, Telecommunications Basket SUNS may not be redeemed
prior to maturity and are not callable by the issuer. Holders of Telecommunications Basket SUNS will be able to cash-out
of their investment by selling the security on the Amex. The Exchange anticipates that the trading value of the security
in this secondary trading market will depend in large part on the value of the securities comprising the Telecommunications
Basket and also on such other factors as the level of interest rates, the volatility of the value of the Telecommunications
Basket, the time remaining to maturity, dividend rates, and the creditworthiness of the issuer, Lehman Brothers.

Because Telecommunications Basket SUNS are linked to a portfolio of equity securities, the Amex's existing equity
floor trading rules will apply to the trading of Telecommunications Basket SUNS. First, pursuant to Amex Rule 411,
the Exchange will impose a duty of due diligence on its members and member firms to learn the essential facts relating
to every customer prior to trading Telecommunications Basket SUNS.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 Second, consistent with Amex Rule 411, the Exchange will further require that a member or member firm specifically
approve a customer's account for trading Telecommunications Basket SUNS prior to, or promptly after, the completion
of the transaction. Third, Telecommunications Basket SUNS will be subject to the equity margin rules of the Exchange.
Fourth, prior to trading Telecommunications Basket SUNS, the Exchange will distribute a circular to the membership,
in the form reviewed by the Commission, providing guidance with regard to member firm compliance responsibilities
(including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in Telecommunications Basket SUNS and highlighting
the special risks and characteristics of the Telecommunications Basket SUNS.

III. Commission Findings and Conclusions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section
6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, the Commission believes that providing for exchange-trading of Telecommunications Basket SUNS
will offer a new and innovative means of participating in the market for global telecommunications securities. In
particular, the Commission believes that Telecommunications Basket SUNS will permit investors to gain equity exposure
in global telecommunications companies, while at the same time, limiting the downside risk of the original investment.22
For these reasons, as well as those discussed in the MITTS Approval Orders,23 the Commission finds that the listing
and trading of Telecommunications Basket SUNS by the Amex is consistent with the Act.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22Pursuant to section 6(b)(5) of the Act the Commission must predicate approval of exchange trading of new products
upon a finding that the introduction of the product is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult with
respect to a product that served no investment, hedging, or other economic function, because any benefits that might
be derived by market participants would likely be outweighed by the potential for manipulation, diminished public
confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns.

As with MITTS, Telecommunications Basket SUNS are not leveraged instruments, however, their price will still be
derived and based upon the underlying basket of securities. Accordingly, the level of risk involved in the purchase
or sale of a Telecommunications Basket SUNS is similar to the risk involved in the purchase or sale of traditional common
stock. Nonetheless, as with the MITTS, the Commission has several specific concerns regarding the trading of this
type of product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes that the Exchange's rules and procedures that address the special concerns attendant to the
trading of hybrid securities will be applicable to Telecommunications Basket SUNS. In particular, by imposing the
hybrid listing standards, suitability, disclosure, and compliance requirements noted above, the Commission believes
the Exchange has addressed adequately the potential problems that could arise from the hybrid nature of Telecommunications
Basket SUNS. Moreover, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership calling attention to the specific
risks associated with Telecommunications Basket SUNS.

The Commission notes that Lehman Brothers intends to have the Pricing Agent publish the value of the Telecommunications
Basket once each business day after 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time for dissemination to electronic reporting services
as well as to newspapers and trade publications. Lehman Brothers asserts that the value of a SUNS does not necessarily
correlate with the intra-day price moves related to the underlying component securities, largely as a result of the
time value to maturity of the SUNS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a general matter, the Commission continues to believe that for new derivative products, real-time dissemination
of the value of the underlying instrument should be provided to all investors. Nevertheless, the Commission has determined
to permit Telecommunications Basket SUNS to trade without real-time dissemination at this time for several reasons.
First, a SUNS is not a leveraged product that has its value determined primarily from the underlying securities but
rather guarantees recoupment of 100% of the principal amount. Second, factors such as the creditworthiness of the
issuer, in addition to price movements in the underlying securities will be relevant in pricing the Telecommunications
Basket SUNS. Third, the Telecommunications Basket SUNS should, at least prior to expiration, trade more like a bond
or debt security, based on the issuer's ability to perform rather than the value of the Telecommunications Basket.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, the Commission believes that real-time dissemination of the aggregate market value of the underlying
Telecommunications Basket is not necessary at this time but would nevertheless expect Lehman Brothers, along with
the Amex, to monitor the product to determine if increased reporting is necessary especially as the product approached
maturity.

Lehman Brothers has agreed to monitor the volatility of the market price of the Global Telecommunications Basket
SUNS in relation to the underlying Global Telecommunications Basket and to discuss with the Commission the need to
implement more frequent portfolio value dissemination in the event of an increase in intra-day volatility. See January

Notwithstanding the above, the Commission still believes that it is useful and beneficial for all investors and market
participants to have access to the value of the portfolio on a real-time basis and encourages the Amex and Lehman Brothers
to further explore the possibilities in this area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission realizes that SUNS do not contain a clearinghouse guarantee (as in the case of standardized options),
but are instead dependent upon the individual credit of the issuer.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 This heightens the possibility that a purchaser of Telecommunications Basket SUNS may not be able to receive the promised
payment of 100% of the principal upon maturity. To some extent this credit risk is minimized by the Exchange's continued
listing standards which require issuers to maintain a minimum aggregate market value of $1 million for its publicly-held
shares.
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Exchange's hybrid listing standards further require that Telecommunications Basket SUNS have
at least $20 million in market value.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 In any event, financial information regarding Lehman Brothers, in addition to information on substantially all
of the issuers of the underlying securities comprising the Telecommunications Basket, will be publicly available.

With the exception of one component (Telekom Malaysia), the securities comprising the Telecommunications Basket
are either issued by companies that are reporting companies under the Act or subject to a limited exemption under Rule
12g3&hyph;2(b) of the Act. See Letter from Benjamin Krause, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets Group, Amex,
to Richard Zack, Branch Chief, Office of Derivatives Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated

The Commission also has a systemic concern, however, that a broker-dealer, such as Lehman Brothers, or a subsidiary
providing a hedge for the issuer will incur position exposure. As discussed in the MITTS Approval Orders, the Commission
believes this concern is minimal given the size of Telecommunications Basket SUNS issuance in relation to the net
worth of Lehman Brothers.

The Commission believes that the listing and trading of Telecommunications Basket SUNS should not unduly impact
the market for the underlying securities comprising the Telecommunications Basket. First, the underlying securities
comprising the portfolio are either well-capitalized stocks, or in the case of ADRS, represent in dollar terms substantial
market value.
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 Second, the all but one of the issuers of the underlying securities comprising the Telecommunications Basket, are
subject to reporting requirements under the Act, and a large percentage of the portfolio securities are either listed
or traded on, or traded over the facilities of, U.S. securities markets.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 Third, the Exchange has surveillance agreements in place for a large percentage of the securities in the Telecommunications
Basket for the sharing of market information.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>
 This in addition to the Amex's surveillance procedures will serve to deter as well as detect any potential manipulation.
Fourth, Lehman Brothers will not include quotations made by or through Lehman Brothers or its affiliates when calculating
the value of the Telecommunications Basket.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 Lastly, the Pricing Agent will agree to restrict information with respect to all calculations of portfolio securities
so that individuals trading such securities on behalf of the Pricing Agent will only be able to receive such information
through public means and not prior to its release to the public.

 thereby making two primary changes to the rules governing summary suspension of the registration of specialists,
odd-lot dealers and market makers. The Exchange proposes to add market makers to the list of members who may have their
registration summarily suspended, and it proposes to limit the authority to summarily suspend the registration
of specialists, odd-lot dealers and market makers to the President of the Exchange.

Suspension and Termination, Rule 16.

Currently, unlike the case of specialists and odd-lot dealers, there is no authority to summarily suspend the registration
of a market maker. Current Exchange Rules dealing with market maker registration only provide for the termination
or suspension of a market maker pursuant to Article XVII by the Floor Procedure Committee (or other committee appointed
for the purpose by the Board) upon a finding of unsatisfactory performance.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The current provisions provide for an initial meeting with Exchange Officials to encourage and assist the market
maker, and for a hearing prior to the termination of the market maker's registration.

The registration of a market maker may be terminated, pursuant to Article XXXIV Registration and Application, Rule
16, upon a finding that he violated the Constitution or Rules of the Exchange or failed adequately to fulfill his responsibilities
as a registered market maker. See also, Article XXXIV, Rule 13, Interpretations and Policies .02 which provides that
the registration of a market maker may be suspended or terminated by the Equity Floor Procedure Committee in accordance

The Exchange is replacing the current provisions governing the suspension of market maker registration with new
summary procedures for the termination of market maker registration.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 These new summary procedures provide that whenever it appears to, or is called to the attention of, the President of
the Exchange that a registered market maker is violating any of the Rules of the Exchange or the federal securities
laws or is conducting market maker business in an unethical manner, the President shall, without the necessity of
previous notice, suspend the registration of such market maker pending the opportunity for a prompt hearing on the
apparent violation in accordance with Article XII of the Rules of the Exchange. The procedures further provide that
notwithstanding the opportunity for a hearing, upon imposition of the summary suspension of registration, the Exchange
shall provide notification thereof to the Commission. The affected market maker
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 may immediately file a request with the Commission for a stay of imposition of the suspension of registration.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rule concludes by stating that the Floor Procedure Committee may suspend or terminate any such registration
based upon a finding, after an opportunity for a hearing, in accordance with Article XVII, that the market maker has
not satisfactorily performed his responsibilities as defined in the federal securities laws and the rules and policies
of the Exchange.

of the specialist and odd-lot dealer.

The proposed rule change also changes current Exchange Rules governing the summary suspension of the registration
of specialists and odd-lot dealers. Currently, the rules allow for summary suspension by either the Floor Procedure
Committee or the President of the Exchange. Such Rules specify that whenever it shall appear or be called to the attention
of any member of the Committee on Floor Procedure or the President that a specialist, co-specialist, relief specialist
or odd-lot dealer is violating any of the Rules of the Exchange or the federal securities laws or is conducting business
in an unethical manner, the member of the Floor Procedure Committee or the President shall, without the necessity
of previous notice, suspend the registration of such party pending an opportunity for prompt hearing on the apparent
violation in accordance with Article XII of the Rules of the Exchange.

Article XXX, Termination of Registration, Rule 8 governs specialists, co-specialists and relief specialists,
and Article XXXI, Termination of Registration, Rule 14 governs odd-lot dealers. Both Rule 8 and Rule 14 also provide
that, notwithstanding the opportunity for hearing, upon imposition of the summary suspension of registration,
the Exchange shall provide notification thereof to the Commission and the affected party may immediately file a request
with the Commission for a stay of imposition of the suspension of registration in accordance with such procedures
as the Commission may provide. Both Rules 8 and 14 further provide that the Committee on Specialist Assignment may
suspend or terminate any such registration based upon a finding (after the opportunity for a hearing in accordance
with Article XVII) that the party has not satisfactorily performed his responsibilities as defined in the federal
securities laws and the rules of the exchange.

The Exchange is eliminating the language in the suspension of registration rules governing specialists, co-specialists,
relief specialists and odd-lot dealers which provides that any member of the Floor Procedure Committee may take action
to summarily suspend the registration of such parties. The amended rule, therefore, permits only the President of
the Exchange to summarily suspend the registration of specialists, co-specialists, relief specialists and odd-lot
dealers. This corresponds to the new market maker summary suspension provisions previously discussed. The Exchange
believes that due to the serious nature of summary suspension of registration, this type of authority is appropriately
exercised only by the President of the Exchange.

III. Discussion and Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds the proposed rule change to be consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of sections
6(b) (5), (6) and (7) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, requires 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that, the rules of an exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to promote
just and equitable principles of trade. The Commission believes that the addition of market makers to the list of persons
who may have their registration summarily suspended will help to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts by allowing
the Exchange to take immediate action against a market maker who is acting unethically or in violation of Exchange
rules or federal securities laws or regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (5), (6) and (7) (1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(b)(6) of the Act provides that the rules of the Exchange should provide that exchange members and persons
associated with its members be appropriately disciplined for violation of the provisions of the Act or rules and regulations
thereunder or the rules of the exchange by expulsion, suspension, limitation of activities, functions, and operations,
fine, censure, being suspended or barred from being associated with a member, or any other fitting sanction. The Commission
believes that the summary suspension of market maker registration is an appropriate disciplinary action in cases
where the market maker has acted unethically, violated Exchange Rules or the federal securities laws, since specialists
and odd-lot dealers are already subject to such action and there is no reason to distinguish among the three groups.
In addition, recent experience has shown the Exchange that summary suspension authority is needed for market makers
as well as for other exchange members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6(b)(7) of the Act provides, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that the rules of an exchange must provide a fair procedure for the disciplining of members and persons associated
with members. The Commission believes that it is fair to limit the power to summarily suspend member registration
to the Exchange President. The Commission agrees that, due to the serious nature of summary suspension, it is appropriate
to limit summary suspension ability to a senior Exchange official. The rules also provide adequate due process to
persons summarily suspended by providing the opportunity for a prompt hearing on the matter and the ability to appeal
any action taken to the Commission.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 24, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items

this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, Interpretation and Policy .01 to CBOE Rule 6.2, ``Trading Rotations,'' provides that the opening transaction
in each class of options traded on the Exchange shall be held promptly following the opening transaction in the underlying
security on the principal exchange where the security is traded. The rules of the other options exchanges allow opening
rotations to commence following the opening of the underlying security.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In order to conform its rules to the rules of the other options exchanges, the CBOE proposes to amend Interpretation
and Policy .01(a) to state that the opening rotation in each class of options shall be held promptly following the opening
of the underlying security on the principal market where the security is traded. Under proposed paragraph (d) to Commentary
.01, an underlying security shall be deemed to have opened on the principal market where it is traded if the market has
(i) reported a transaction in the underlying security or (ii) disseminated opening quotations for the underlying
security and not given an indication of a delayed opening, whichever first occurs. In addition, the CBOE proposes
to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 to provide that any member appointed as a Designated Primary Market-Maker
(``DPM'') shall participate in opening rotations to the same extent as an Order Book Official (``OBO'').

The CBOE proposes to amend Exchange Rule 6.2, Interpretation and Policy .01 to allow opening rotations in Exchange-listed
options to commence upon the earlier of the following events: (i) the report of an opening transaction in the underlying
security on the primary market, or (ii) the dissemination of opening quotations by such market. In addition, the CBOE
proposes to amend Interpretation and Policy .01 to provide specifically that a DPM shall participate in opening rotations
to the same extent as an OBO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, CBOE Rule 6.62, Interpretation and Policy .01 provides that the opening rotation in each class of option
contracts traded on the CBOE will commence promptly following the opening transaction in the underlying security.
The rules of the other options exchanges provide that opening rotations will commence following the opening of the
underlying security.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The CBOE states that the other options exchanges interpret their rules to permit the commencement of opening rotations
upon the earlier of either a reported transaction in the underlying security or a reported market quote for the security,
provided that the primary market has not given any indication of a delayed opening. The CBOE's proposal is designed
to conform the commencement of opening rotations at the CBOE to that of the other options exchanges, thereby alleviating
the risk of inter-market pricing disparities.

In addition, the proposal modifies Interpretation and Policy .01 to provide specifically that any member appointed
as a DPM shall participate in opening rotations to the same extent as an OBO. The CBOE believes that this amendment states
expressly what is implied by paragraph (c) of CBOE Rule 8.80, ``Modified Trading System,'' which provides, in part,
that when acting as an OBO in appointed options classes, the DPM shall fulfill all obligations associated with the
OBO's functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The CBOE believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act, in general, and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5), in particular, in that it is designed to clarify the meaning of existing CBOE rules
and to conform the CBOE's rules to the rules of the other options exchanges, thereby contributing to a fair and orderly
market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The CBOE has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section 19(b)(2)
of the Act. The CBOE states that the proposal is intended to minimize the risk of pricing disparities at the opening
of trading on the Exchange. With the expansion of multiple trading of options as provided in Rule 19c&hyph;5 of the
Act, the CBOE believes it is imperative that the CBOE conform the commencement of its opening rotations to the procedures
of the other options exchanges. In addition, the CBOE states that its proposal raises no new regulatory concerns because
the Exchange is adopting procedures that have been adopted previously by the other options exchanges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section
6(b)(5) thereunder
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 in that the proposal is designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market by conforming
the CBOE's opening procedures to those of the other options exchanges. Specifically, the CBOE's proposal will allow
the Exchange to commence opening rotations upon the earlier of either a reported transaction in the underlying security
or a reported market quote for the security (provided that the primary market has not indicated a delayed opening),
rather than waiting for an opening transaction in the underlying security, as required currently under CBOE Rule
6.2, Interpretation and Policy .01.

The CBOE states that only quotations disseminated at the opening on a trading day will be deemed to have opened the market
in an underlying security. Stale quotations disseminated on a prior trading day will not be deemed to have opened the
market in an underlying security. See Letter from Michael L. Meyer, Schiff Hardin &amp; Waite, to Richard Zack, Branch

In addition, by allowing the CBOE to commence opening rotations after the opening of the underlying security on the
primary market where it is traded, the Commission believes that the proposal should decrease the time required to
obtain opening market quotations and should allow free trading to commence as quickly as possible after the opening.
As the Commission has noted in the past, expedited free trading will allow market makers to engage in hedging strategies
as soon as possible after the opening and will result in the prompt execution of customer orders.

The Commission also believes that the proposal clarifies Interpretation and Policy .01 and CBOE Rule 8.80(c) by providing
specifically that a DPM shall participate in opening rotations to the same extent as an OBO, thereby eliminating potential
confusion concerning the obligations of a DPM during opening rotations.

 because the proposal amends the CBOE's rules to conform the CBOE's opening rotations to the procedures used on the
other options exchanges. The Commission does not believe that the CBOE's proposal raise new regulatory issues. In
addition, the Commission finds good cause for approving the CBOE's amendment regarding the obligations of DPMs under
CBOE Rule 6.2, Interpretation and Policy .01 because the amendment clarifies the existing obligations of DPMs under

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on January 7, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The purpose of the proposed rule change is to strengthen
the MRSB's rules governing customer suitability. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on
the proposed rule change from interested persons.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is filing amendments to rule G&hyph;19, concerning suitability of recommendations and rule G&hyph;8 concerning
recordkeeping. The proposed rule change: (1) Clarifies and strengthens the existing language of rule G&hyph;19
that requires suitability determinations to be made when recommending transactions to customers; (2) clarifies
the obligation of dealers to make reasonable efforts to obtain specific types of customer suitability information
for all accounts that are not ``institutional accounts'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, retail accounts); and (3) clarifies the definition of ``institutional account.''

In its filing with the Commission, the Board included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below and is set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is designed to strengthen the Board's customer suitability rule. In a letter dated May 8,
1992, the Commission's Division of Market Regulation asked the Board to review the requirements of rule G&hyph;19
on suitability of recommendations.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In September 1992, the Board published a Request for Comments on a number of customer protection issues, including
the application of rule G&hyph;19 to customer transactions. After reviewing these matters, the Board decided that
rule G&hyph;19 embodies the appropriate general standard for dealers in making recommendations to customers. Nevertheless,
the Board recognized there was a perception that certain provisions of the rule could be viewed as permitting recommendations
to go forward without proper regard to the nature of the security being recommended and the customer to whom it is recommended.
Accordingly, at the May 1993 Board meeting, the Board approved a Request for Comments on draft amendments to clarify
and strengthen the suitability requirements of rule G&hyph;19. The draft amendments were approved at the November
1993 Board meeting and form the basis of the proposed rule change.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule G&hyph;19 generally requires that, before making any recommendation to a customer, a dealer must first determine
that the proposed transaction is suitable for the customer. To strengthen rule G&hyph;19, the proposed rule change
eliminates two provisions from the rule which, in effect, are exceptions to this general requirement. The first such
provision permits a dealer to make a recommendation when a customer refuses to provide sufficient information about
himself for the dealer to determine that the recommendation is suitable for the customer. The provision states that
a recommendation can go forward in this case as long as the dealer has no reasonable grounds to believe and does not believe
that the recommendation is unsuitable (the ``not unsuitable'' provision). Although the Board did not conclude that
this provision was the cause of customer protection problems (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, there was no evidence that dealers relied on this provision to make unsuitable recommendations), the Board believed
that the provision should be deleted to avoid any ambiguities regarding a dealer's obligation to make a suitability
determination. Eliminating the provision also will prevent any future use of the provision as an excuse for unsuitable
recommendations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second provision of rule G&hyph;19 that is removed by the proposed rule change provides that a dealer, notwithstanding
its determination that a transaction is not suitable for a customer, may, after so informing the customer of this,
nevertheless respond to the customer's requests for investment advice and execute transactions at the direction
of the customer. This ``notwithstanding'' provision allows dealers to recommend specific municipal securities
to investors who want to invest in municipal securities even after being informed by the dealer that, based on their
financial circumstances, investments in municipal securities would not be suitable. While there have been no reported
problems associated with this provision, the Board, nevertheless, believed that this exemptive provision also
should be deleted to strengthen the suitability rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also reviewed and clarified the customer data inquiries that are necessary for non-institutional and institutional
accounts. For non-institutional (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, retail) accounts, the proposed rule change clarifies that dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain the following
information: the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and such other information used
or considered to be reasonable and necessary by the dealer in making recommendations to the customer. For some institutional
customers, however, these specific information requests may not be appropriate. For example, the ``tax status''
of a tax-exempt bond fund generally is not relevant to a suitability determination. Therefore, the proposed rule
change does not provide a specific list of items that must be requested from all institutional accounts, but does state
that dealers must obtain appropriate and sufficient data from each institutional customer to make a suitability
determination for each transaction that is recommended (as also is required for non-institutional accounts).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the proposed rule change revises the definition of ``institutional account'' contained in rule G&hyph;8.
This definition is used in rule G&hyph;19, by cross-reference. This amendment would make the Board's definition
of institutional account the same as the National Association of Securities Dealers' (``NASD'') definition for
purposes of suitability determinations. Accounts that do not qualify as ``institutional accounts'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, retail accounts) would be subject to the specific information inquiries described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act which provides that
the Board's rules:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles
of trade *&blank;*&blank;* to remove impediments and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal
securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board believes that the proposed rule change will protect investors and the public interest because it is designed
to ensure that dealers, before making a recommendation to a customer, make a determination that the municipal securities
transaction is suitable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Because the proposed rule change will have an equal impact on all dealers, the Board believes that the proposed rule
change will not have any impact on competition.

September 1992 Request for Comments

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In September 1992, as part of the Board's general review of customer protection measures, the Board requested comment
on potential problem areas in the municipal securities market and suggestions for how customer protection could
be improved. Specific questions were asked about the effectiveness of rule G&hyph;19 and the Board obtained various
comments on the ``not unsuitable'' provision of rule G&hyph;19 from Merrill Lynch, North American Securities Administrators
Association, Barre &amp; Co., Griffen, Kubik, Stephens &amp; Thompson, and the Public Securities Association.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While some of these commentators at that time believed that the ``not unsuitable'' provision should be deleted, other
commentators believed it should be retained because some customers do not wish to provide certain information about
themselves. Specifically, two commentators believed that removing the provision would not be a problem and would
make the Board's rule consistent with normal practice in other securities markets. Three commentators noted that
some customers do not want to provide their financial information to a dealer. One of those commentators indicated,
however, that ``in the vast majority of cases, dealers do routinely obtain information for each customer account
reflecting net worth, income level and investment objectives.''

In August 1993, the Board published for comment the proposed rule change. Comment letters were received from Fidelity
Investments, First Interstate Bank of Oregon, Heitner Corporation, Lehman Brothers, Liberty Bank and Trust Company
of Tulsa, Merrill Lynch, and the Securities Department of Arkansas.

Comments on the General Approach of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the commentators' reaction to the approach taken by the proposed rule change was favorable. One commentator
agreed with the Board's approach by stating that the proposed rule change would address a ``difficult problem'' by
deleting the ``not unsuitable'' and ``notwithstanding'' provisions from the current suitability rule. Another
commentator noted that rule G&hyph;19 ``as reformulated by the Board sets forth an appropriate affirmative standard.''
Two other commentators also expressed general support for the approach taken by the proposed rule change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commentators expressed reservations over removal of the ``not unsuitable'' and the ``notwithstanding'' provisions.
One commentator opposed both changes because of its belief that the majority of its customers are not willing ``to
divulge their financial strength.'' Another commentator, while indicating that it does not make recommendations
in municipal securities to customers, also believes that the ``notwithstanding'' provision should be retained
because a customer may disagree with a dealer's opinion of unsuitability. That commentator indicated that dealers
should be permitted to make recommendations to a customer who has already decided to purchase a municipal security
and who asks for assistance in choosing an issue, even if the transaction would be unsuitable for the customer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the ``not unsuitable'' and the ``notwithstanding'' provisions were initially adopted by the Board in the late
1970s for reasons similar to those cited by the commentators, the Board notes that there have been significant changes
in the municipal securities market since that time. The number of retail investors has increased and the introduction
of increasing numbers of complex, and in some cases, speculative municipal securities has become a characteristic
of today's market. In such an environment, the Board believes that it is critical that dealers have clear policies
to ensure that sales personnel do not recommend securities to customers without first establishing the suitability
of the transaction. Therefore, the Board believes that the proposed rule change deleting these provisions is necessary.

Comments on Specific Provisions of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commentators offered several specific suggestions and sought guidance from the Board in a number of areas of the proposed
rule change.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Customer Account Data and Suitability Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change includes an amendment to rule G&hyph;19(b) which states that, for retail customers, prior
to making a recommendation a dealer must ``make reasonable effort to obtain information concerning: (i) The customer's
financial status; (ii) the customer's tax status; (iii) the customer's investment objectives; and (iv) such other
information used or considered to be reasonable and necessary by such broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer
in making recommendations to the customer.'' Two commentators were concerned as to what would happen if all such information
could not be obtained. As indicated in the Request for Comments, the language of the proposed rule change does not necessarily
preclude a dealer from making a recommendation if all items of information enumerated in the proposed amendment to
rule G&hyph;19(b) cannot be obtained. Given the nature of the transaction (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the nature of the security and the known items of information about the customer), the dealer may have enough customer
data to make a specific, affirmative suitability determination for the recommendation, even if the customer refuses
to provide some of the requested information. However, reasonable efforts must be made to obtain all customer information
listed in the proposed amendment to rule G&hyph;19(b), in any event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, the amount of customer information that is required to make a suitability determination depends in
part upon the nature of the transaction recommended. With respect to some types of transactions_for example, those
in more speculative securities_the amount of information needed to make a suitability determination will be greater
than if a more conservative recommendation is being made. One commentator requested that the Board provide guidance
on this subject by specifying ``core'' suitability information that must be obtained from a customer even when making
a ``conservative'' recommendation. That commentator also requested that the Board provide specific guidance on
what would be considered ``more speculative'' securities for which more detailed customer account data would be
needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change to rule G&hyph;19(b) states that dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain certain
``core'' customer suitability data for recommendations to non-institutional customers including: (i) The customer's
financial status; (ii) the customer's tax status; (iii) the customer's investment objectives; and (iv) such other
information used or considered to be reasonable and necessary by such broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer
in making recommendations to the customer. The Board notes that if, after reasonable efforts, a dealer cannot obtain
all such information regarding a customer, but nevertheless desires to proceed with a ``conservative'' transaction,
the dealer must exercise its judgment, based on known information about the customer and the security, as to whether
a suitability determination can be made. Furthermore, all information about the customer that is used in making this
determination must be recorded in the customer account record under rule G&hyph;8(a)(xi)(F).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also believes it to be inadvisable to attempt to provide detailed guidance on whether a particular security
or proposed transaction is more ``conservative'' or more ``speculative.'' The Board notes that dealers will have
to make such decisions based on their knowledge of the security and the risks involved in the transaction. Attempts
to state a universally applicable formula for such considerations could encourage the substitution of simplistic
guidelines for the broader judgment that is sometimes required to determine whether a proposed municipal securities
transaction includes a relatively low or high degree of risk.

Unsolicited Transactions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commentators requested that the Board provide guidance on how to identify and document ``unsolicited''
transactions, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
transactions that are not recommended. Neither the current version of rule G&hyph;19 nor the proposed rule change
precludes dealers from executing specific transactions at the request of customers, where no recommendation is
made. Thus, the suitability requirements of the proposed rule change would not apply to such ``unsolicited'' transactions.
The Board notes, however, that most municipal securities transactions are made in connection with recommendations.
Because of its concern with customer protection and in recognition of the special characteristics of the municipal
securities market, the Board views the term ``recommendation'' (and the application of the Board's suitability
requirement) broadly. For example, with respect to transactions occurring after investment seminars and in response
to a dealer's advertisements, the Board has indicated that the suitability requirements of G&hyph;19 apply ``in
the same way they apply to all other recommendations made to customers.'' Thus, although transactions may, in some
instances, be ``unsolicited'' if a customer places an order for a specific security, transactions cannot be considered
unsolicited if the order occurs after a dealer has mentioned a specific security to a customer (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in a listing of offerings, an advertisement or in any other communication by the dealer to the customer).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commentator asked how ``unsolicited'' orders should be specified in a dealer's records, and whether such orders
should always be handled by the dealer ``as agent.'' Board rules do not require dealers to handle specific types of
orders as either principal or agent. Rule G&hyph;8(a)(vi), however, specifies the recordkeeping requirements
for the terms and conditions of an agency order, including the fact that it is an agency order. Similarly, rule G&hyph;15(a)(vii)
requires the confirmation to state the agency role of a dealer in a transaction. Neither rule G&hyph;8 nor rule G&hyph;15
has provisions for documenting orders as ``unsolicited.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously noted, the Board believes that relatively few transactions in municipal securities actually are ``unsolicited.''
While documenting these relatively rare transactions as such on the confirmation and in the dealer's records may
be prudent for the dealer's own protection, the Board is concerned that incorporating a requirement in the Board's
rules might have the unintended and undesired effect of encouraging the classification of transactions as ``unsolicited,''
even when they are not ``unsolicited'' under Board rules.

Institutional Accounts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board received several comments concerning the proposed definition for institutional account contained in
the proposed rule change and the more generally stated suitability standard for institutional accounts. No commentator
argued that it was inappropriate to distinguish between institutional and non-institutional investors when obtaining
customer account data and making suitability determinations. One commentator believed the proposed standard for
institutional investors was appropriate and noted that the information relevant to a suitability determination
for a specific institutional account is necessarily a matter of judgment for the dealer. One commentator, however,
suggested the establishment of specific minimum requirements for institutional accounts and specifically suggested
that dealers should document the customer's investment objectives (including credit quality and maturity standards)
and ``other information'' used or considered reasonable or necessary by the dealer. Another commentator suggested
including corporate resolutions, trading authorization, and yearly audited financial statements as required
information for institutional customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated by several commentators, it is often necessary or advisable to obtain specific kinds of information
from an institutional investor. Rule G&hyph;8(a)(xi)(F) currently requires that the customer suitability information
used to make a suitability determination be recorded in the customer account record. The proposed rule change to rule
G&hyph;8 also makes this requirement clear. In addition, rule G&hyph;8(a)(xi) also requires other customer account
information including, among other things, the customer's name and address, tax identification or social security
number and with respect to discretionary accounts, the customer's written authorization. For various types of institutional
accounts, it may be advisable for dealers to obtain certain additional data and documentation. Often this additional
documentation may be necessary for the dealer's own protection (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, trading authorizations). Similarly, for certain institutional accounts, dealers may wish to obtain yearly audited
financial statements where assurance is desired that the account is and remains an institutional account for the
purpose of rule G&hyph;19.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the wide variety in the types of institutional accounts and the documentation that might be necessary to
establish suitability or otherwise considered to be necessary and prudent by the dealer, the Board believes that
dealers ultimately will have to employ a certain degree of judgment in determining what information and documentation
should be obtained and recorded for specific institutional customers beyond that now required by rule G&hyph;8(a)(xi).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commentator noted that, in many instances, a suitability determination should be made on the basis of the investment
objectives articulated by an institution for a specific transaction or a specific component of a large investment
portfolio. In these cases, the overall investment objectives of the institution or portfolio may not be the deciding
factor in determining suitability. The Board notes that this view is consistent with the current language of rule
G&hyph;19 and the proposed rule change, which requires that a dealer have reasonable grounds for recommending a transaction
``based on the facts disclosed by such customer or otherwise known about such customer.'' Clearly, if specific portfolio
or transaction objectives are given, the proposed rule change and current Board rules require that such information
be used to make a suitability determination and be recorded pursuant to rule G&hyph;8(a)(xi)(F).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commentator preferred the Commission's definition of ``accredited investor'' to the definition of ``institutional
account'' in the proposed rule change. The Commission's accredited investor definition includes a wide range of
investors, such as any private business development company or individuals making in excess of $200,000 per year
for three years. The term ``accredited investor'' is used as part of an exemptive provision from certain registration
requirements under the Securities Act of 1933. Having a customer classified as an ``accredited investor,'' however,
does not excuse dealers from obtaining specific customer account data when making recommendations in equity transactions.
Moreover, because ``institutional account''_rather than ``accredited investor''_is used by the NASD to define
a dealer's customer account requirements, the Board believes that the use of a different test for municipal securities
transactions would complicate the internal recordkeeping requirements of most securities firms.

Transactions With Investment Advisors
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commentators requested clarification of the suitability requirements that exist when a dealer executes a transaction
for an investment advisor. The Board notes that this question is answered by determining who the dealer's customer
is_the investment advisor or the investment advisor's client. The Board believes that, in general, the investment
advisor will be the dealer's customer. However, it is not possible to state this as an ironclad rule. The requirement
for establishing suitability may depend on whether the beneficial owner is looking to the dealer or exclusively to
the investment advisor for recommendations on investments. The dealer, of course, should obtain the necessary customer
account data from whomever is the customer. If the investment advisor is the customer, then the dealer would proceed
as with other institutional accounts. However, if a dealer has a dealer-customer relationship with the beneficial
owner and treats that entity as its own customer, then the dealer must obtain the information necessary to make a suitability
determination prior to making a recommendation. In this case, the investment advisor is treated as an interested
party to the transaction.

The NYSE states that the purpose of the increase to continuing listing fees is to offset in part the increased costs
of supplying services provided by the Exchange. These costs include manpower, automation, utilities and other costs
associated with providing marketplace facilities and services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of section 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(4) requirements that the
rules of an exchange provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members,
issuers, and other persons using the Exchange's facilities.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that the increases in continuing listing fees are equitable because the increases should
not result in an excessive allocation of NYSE fees on its issuers as opposed to members and other persons using its facilities.
The Commission further finds that the fees are reasonable because the Exchange has proposed the increases to offset
rising costs. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to approve the proposed rule change.

For instance, the American Stock Exchange (``AMEX'') recently introduced, with the Commission's approval, a new
method of calculating stock indexes. This new methodology, called the equal dollar weighting methodology, is designed
to ensure that each of the component securities in a stock index is represented in approximately equal dollar amounts.
The equal dollar weighting calculation method uses both the market price and the capitalization value of the component
stocks to determine the relative representation of stocks within an index.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AMEX originally proposed the equal dollar weighting methodology with the introduction of the Biotechnology Index
(Securities Exchange Act Release No. 31245 (September 28, 1992), 57 FR 45844 [File No. SR&hyph;AMEX&hyph;92&hyph;1]
(order approving proposal to list options on Biotechnology Index)]. In addition, the Commission recently approved
a proposal that expands the use of this methodology with the introduction of the Morgan Stanley Indexes [Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 32875 (September 13, 1993), 58 FR 48906 [File No. SR&hyph;AMEX&hyph;93&hyph;8] (order
approving a proposal relating to the trading of options on the Morgan Stanley Cyclical and Consumer Indexes and long-term
options on Reduced Value Cyclical and Consumer Indexes].

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Article XVII, Section 1 of OCC's By-Laws currently defines the term index group as ``a group of securities whose inclusion
and relative representation in group is determined by the inclusion and relative representation of their current
market prices in a securities index specified by an Exchange.'' To ensure that the definition of index group encompasses
all currently traded indexes as well as other types of indexes that may be developed by the exchanges in the future,
the proposed rule change will omit from the current definition of index group any reference to market price as the method
for determining the relative representation of a stock within an index. Instead, the term index group will be more
broadly defined as ``a group of securities whose inclusion and relative representation in the group is determined
by their inclusion and relative representation in a securities index specified by an Exchange.'' This change is intended
to clarify that an index need not be based on a strictly proportional representation of the market prices of the index's
component stocks.

II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that OCC's proposal is consistent with the Act and in particular with Section 17A thereunder.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Section 17A(b)(3)(F) provides, among other things, that the rules of a clearing agency must be designed to remove
impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement
of securities transactions.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 By broadly defining the term index group and thereby clarifying that present and future exchange-listed indexes
will be included thereunder, the proposal helps to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system
for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and in particular
with Section 17A thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is therefore ordered,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;93&hyph;16) be,

On September 11, 1990, The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;90&hyph;11)
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 to revise OCC's market-maker account structure. Notice of OCC's proposal was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 12, 1990.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 On July 10, 1991, and on March 13, 1992, OCC filed Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2, respectively.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Both amendments were technical in nature and did not require republication of notice of filing. No written comments
were received. As discussed below, the Commission is approving OCC's proposal.

Amendment No. 1 modified the filing by separately defining the term ``related person'' to simplify the definition
of ``associated market-maker.'' Amendment No. 1 also added to the proposal and defined the term ``proprietary market
professional.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Amendment No. 2 modified the filing by amending the Associated Market-Maker Consent agreement, which an associated
market-maker uses to elect to have its account treated as a proprietary market-maker's account. The agreement was
amended in connection with the Commission's no-action letter from Michael A. Macchiaroli, Assistant Director,
Division, Commission, to James R. McDaniel, Schiff Hardin &amp; Waite [Counsel to OCC] (March 27, 1992) in response
to a letter from James R. McDaniel, Shiff Hardin &amp; Waite [Counsel to OCC], to Michael A. Macchiaroli, Assistant
Director, Division, Commission (May 21, 1990).

A. In General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change authorizes OCC to exclude from a clearing member's combined market-makers' account the
exchange transactions and positions of market-makers, specialists, or registered traders that are directly or
indirectly related to or associated with the carrying clearing member (``associated market-makers'').
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Positions excluded from the combined market-makers' account as a result of this proposal can be maintained by the
clearing member either in a separate market-maker's account (that is specifically limited to the positions of the
clearing member) or in a proprietary market-maker account under certain circumstances as described below.

The term associated market-maker is defined as a person maintaining an account with a clearing member as a market-maker,
specialist, stock market-maker, stock specialist, or registered trader that is a ``related person'' of the clearing
member and includes any participant in an account of which 10% or more is owned by an associated market-maker or an aggregate
of 10% or more is owned by one or more associated market-makers. OCC By-Laws, Article I, Section 1.A(10).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A person is a related person of the clearing member if such person (1) is a business affiliate that controls, is controlled
by, or is under common control with the clearing member or any officer, director, or general or special partner of the
clearing member, (2) is a spouse or minor living in the same household as the related person or any non-customer of the
clearing member, or (3) is an employee who manages the business or funds of the clearing member. The term related person
does not include a non-customer of the clearing member. Direct or indirect control of 10% or more of the equity of any
entity is deemed to confer control of that entity. OCC By-Laws, Article I, Section 1.R(3).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3(c) of Article VI of OCC's By-Laws permits a clearing member to maintain a combined market-makers' account.
A combined market-makers' account is confined to the exchange transactions and positions of market-makers who have
consented to the commingling of their positions with those of other market-makers. Currently, section 3(c) specifically
prohibits the carrying clearing member from participating in its combined market-makers' account, and OCC's market-makers'
account agreement prohibits non-customers of the carrying clearing member from participating in the carrying clearing
member's combined market-makers' account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Non-customer'' is defined in Article I, Section N(1) of OCC's By-Laws to include the clearing member, any general
or special partner of the clearing member, any officer or director of the clearing member, or any participant, as such,
in any joint, group, or syndicate account with the clearing member or with any partner, officer, or director of the
clearing member. This definition was drafted to encompass, in addition to the clearing member itself, only those
categories of persons who are specifically excluded from the definition of customer in the Commission's hypothecation
rules.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Because OCC's definition of non-customer is so narrowly drafted, OCC's rules currently permit a market-maker that
is closely related to its carrying clearing member to commingle its positions with the positions of market-makers
that are unrelated to the carrying clearing member in the carrying clearing member's combined market makers' account.

Commission Rules 8c&hyph;1 and 15c2&hyph;1 [17 CFR 240.8c&hyph;1 and 240.15c2&hyph;1]. Hypothecation is the pledging
of securities as collateral for loans made to purchase securities or to cover short sells. Generally, the Commission's
hypothecation rules prohibit hypothecating or arranging for the hypothecation of securities carried for the account
of a customer under circumstances that permit:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) the commingling without written consent of a customer's securities with the securities of any other customer;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the commingling of a customer's securities with the securities of any person other than a bona fide customer; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the hypothecation of customers' securities for a sum in excess of the aggregate indebtedness of all such customers
with respect to such securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of its experience during the 1989 market break, OCC believes that the commingling of positions of associated
market-makers with those of unrelated market-makers significantly increases the risks to unrelated market-makers,
OCC, and the options markets.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Such associated market-makers may be financially dependent upon the carrying clearing member or may be under common
direction with respect to trading strategies and risk management. In the event of the failure of the clearing member,
the conditions which led to such failure may also lead to the insolvency of the associated market-maker. If the associated
market-maker's positions are carried in a combined market-makers' account, OCC may be unable to separate the collateral
supporting the positions in the combined market-makers' account from the collateral supporting the carrying clearing
member's proprietary positions. As a result, OCC may have difficulty in transferring the unrelated market-makers'
positions and supporting collateral even though those positions continue to be viable. OCC believes that prohibiting
the commingling of the positions of associated market-makers with the positions of unrelated market-makers will
facilitate OCC's ability to transfer expeditiously viable accounts of the unrelated market-makers to other clearing
members in the event of a failure of the carrying clearing member. Consequently, OCC's and the unrelated market-makers'
risk of loss should be decreased.

 Because each separate market-maker's account is restricted to the transactions of a single market-maker, the positions
of an associated market-maker that are maintained in such an account will not be commingled with the positions of other
market-makers or with the positions of the clearing firm.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Under OCC rules, a clearing member that maintains a separate market-maker's account for its proprietary market-maker
positions (``proprietary market-maker account'') may elect to have the positions in that account combined with
the positions in its firm account for purposes of margin calculations
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 as a clearing member may elect to have its associated market-makers' positions treated as proprietary positions
so that the associated market-makers' positions are combined with firm positions for purposes of margin calculation.

Under the proposal, Article I, Section 1.P(5) of OCC By-Laws defines proprietary market-maker as a market-maker,
specialist, stock market-maker, stock specialist, or registered trader that is (A) a non-customer of the carrying
clearing member or (B) a related person of the clearing member that (1) is not a customer of the clearing member for purposes
of Commission Rule 15c3&hyph;3 [17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;3], (2) does not carry the accounts of persons who are customers
for purposes of Commission Rule 15c3&hyph;3, and (3) has consented to be treated as a proprietary market-maker. Thus,
a proprietary market-maker account can be maintained by not only the clearing member itself but also by any non-customer
of the clearing member. See also OCC's Amendment No. 2, discussed

It is generally advantageous to a clearing member to maintain positions in a combined market-makers' account rather
than in a separate market-maker's account. Market-makers' positions in the combined market makers' account can
be used as offsets or hedges against each other which may result in a lower margin requirement for the clearing member.

OCC's proposal responds to the events surrounding the default of an OCC clearing member on October 13, 1989.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 The defaulting clearing member carried in a combined market-makers' account the positions of an associated market-maker
and the positions of approximately 160 unaffiliated market-makers. One person owned 100% of both the defaulting
clearing member and the associated market-maker.

For a detailed discussion of the events surrounding the clearing member default, refer to Market Analysis of October
13 and 16, 1989, A Report by the Division of Market Regulation, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (December
1990), 158&hyph;60 and 164&hyph;66. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of the precipitous decline in the markets on Friday, October 13, 1987, OCC issued an intraday margin call to
the defaulting clearing member whose settlement bank informed OCC that it would neither honor OCC's intraday margin
call nor extend further credit to the defaulting clearing member. In an effort to cure the default, OCC directed the
defaulting clearing member to transfer the positions in its accounts, particularly positions that were carried
for unaffiliated market-makers and customers, to another OCC clearing member. Because the associated market-maker's
positions were commingled with those of unaffiliated market-makers in a combined market-makers' account, OCC was
unable to distinguish the collateral relating to the associated market-maker's positions from the collateral relating
to the unaffiliated market-makers' positions in the account. Consequently, OCC was required to direct the defaulting
clearing member to transfer all of the positions in its combined market-makers' account. Although this did not preclude
the transfer, it did make the transfer of the non-proprietary positions more difficult. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that OCC's proposal will enhance OCC's clearing member monitoring and risk management capabilities
in several respects. As an initial matter, the Commission notes that OCC's current market-maker account structure
permits clearing members to mask proprietary activity by forming associated market-makers and combining the positions
of such market-makers with those of unaffiliated market-makers in a combined market-makers' account. Although
OCC can separate the positions of the associated market-makers from those of unaffiliated market-makers, the present
account structure can complicate OCC's monitoring of clearing member positions. Currently, before OCC can assess
the positions under a clearing member's control, OCC must separate associated market-makers' positions from unaffiliated
market-makers' positions and then must combine the associated market-makers' positions with the clearing member's
positions. By requiring the associated market-makers' positions to be maintained apart from the unaffiliated market-makers'
positions, OCC's proposal should enhance its ability to monitor the positions of its clearing members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal also should enhance OCC's risk management capabilities by providing OCC with a more accurate representation
of clearing members' financial condition. Generally, there are two levels of capital supporting the trading and
positions of a clearing member's market-maker.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 However, as the above-described clearing member default illustrates, this may not be the case when a clearing member
carriers the account of an associated market-maker because the clearing member and the associated market-maker
may be relying on the same sources of financing to support their trading activities. Thus, by requiring that associated
market-maker hold their positions either in a separate account or is a proprietary market-maker's account, OCC's
proposal should provide OCC with a more accurate picture of its sources of exposure and the financial ability of a particular
firm to cover such exposure in the event of a clearing member default.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal also should enhance OCC's ability to administer a clearing member's account in the event of the clearing
member's default. If the financial or operational condition of a clearing member makes it necessary or advisable
for the protection of OCC or other clearing members, OCC has the authority to direct a clearing member to transfer some
or all of its accounts to another clearing member.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 However, if associated market-maker's positions are held with the positions of unaffiliated market-makers in a
combined market-makers' account, as in the situation described above, OCC may experience difficulty in separating
the collateral supporting the associated market-maker's positions from the collateral supporting the positions
of the unaffiliated market-makers' positions thereby making the transfer of unaffiliated market-makers' positions
difficult if not impossible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is therefore ordered, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
pursuant to Section 19(b) (2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;OCC&hyph;90&hyph;11) be,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend OCC's By-Laws and Rules to accommodate cash-settled foreign currency
options such as have been proposed for trading by the PHLX. In general, these amended By-Laws and Rules will apply the
same procedures OCC currently uses to clear and settle transactions in existing options to the clearance and settlement
of cash-settled foreign currency options. However, unlike OCC's procedures with respect to other foreign currency
options, cash-settled foreign currency options will be settled by requiring clearing members to pay to or receive
from OCC the amount of U.S. Dollars that reflects the difference between the spot price
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 and the exercise price of the underlying foreign currency.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Cash-settled foreign currency options that are in-the-money by any amount on the expiration date will be automatically
exercised. Options not automatically exercised will expire unexercised. Clearing members will not be permitted
to submit exercise instructions with respect to cash-settled foreign currency options.

Currently, all OCC-cleared index options are cash-settled. The procedures proposed for exercise settlement of
cash-settled foreign currency options are similar to the procedures for exercise settlement of index options. Pursuant
to OCC Rule 1806, index options settle by OCC either paying to or collecting from the exercising or assigned clearing
member the difference in U.S. dollars between the exercise price of the index option and the exercise settlement value
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

are amended to add references to cash-settled foreign currency options. The definition of ``exercising clearing
member'' is amended to make clear that when used with respect to an option that is subject to an automatic exercise,
including cash-settled foreign currency options, the term refers to the clearing member in whose account an option
so exercised is carried.

Section 3 provides that if the country of origin of an underlying foreign currency should (i) issue a new currency intended
to replace its then existing currency as the standard unit of the official medium of exchange of such country or (ii)
officially alter the exchange rate or exchange characteristics of its currency with respect to other currencies,
an adjustment panel, consisting of the Chairman of OCC and two designated representatives of each exchange on which
the affected cash-settled foreign currency options are traded, shall determine whether to make adjustments to the
exercise price, unit of trading, number of contracts, underlying foreign currency, or other terms of option contracts
affected by such event. The adjustment panel will consider such factors as fairness to holders and writers of affected

Rule 2302 sets forth the expiration date exercise procedures for cash-settled foreign currency option contracts.
Under Rule 2302, a cash-settled foreign currency clearing member shall be automatically deemed to have properly
and irrevocably tendered to OCC immediately prior to the expiration time on the expiration date an exercise notice
with respect to each cash-settled foreign currency option contract listed in the report made available to the clearing
member pursuant to Rule 806(a), the Exercise and Assignment Activity Report, that has an exercise price below the
spot price in the case of a call or above the spot price in the case of a put. Rule 2302 replaces Rules 802 and 805 and supplements
Rule 806 for cash-settled foreign currency options.

Rule 2303 describes the assignment of automatic exercises of cash-settled foreign currency options. Because all
cash-settled foreign currency options in a series that is in the money will be automatically exercised, an assignment
will be made to each short position in the series. Accordingly, Rule 2303 contains no reference to OCC's Rule 803, which
describes the random assignment of exercise notices.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Paragraph (b) of Rule 2303 states that OCC shall make available to each clearing member with cash-settled foreign
currency options an Exercise and Assignment Activity Report on the business day following the expiration date. This
report will reflect the clearing member's exercises of cash-settled foreign currency options and its assignments
of obligations relating to exercises of cash-settled foreign currency options.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The random assignment procedure described in Rule 803 is built into OCC's exercise and assignment system. Because
OCC will use its exercise and assignment system to administer and generate reports for assignments of cash-settled
foreign currency options, OCC, as an operational matter, will actually use the random assignment procedure for assignments
of automatic exercises of cash-settled foreign currency options. However, the use of the procedure will have no effect
on writers or assigned clearing members because all short positions will be assigned.

Rule 2304 states that the settlement date for exercised cash-settled foreign currency options will be the day immediately
following the expiration date. Rule 2305 states that settlement of cash-settled foreign currency options will occur
by the payment of the exercise settlement amounts from assigned clearing members to OCC and by the payment of the exercise
settlement amounts from OCC to exercising clearing members. Under Rule 2305, OCC may net exercise settlement amounts
to be paid by a clearing member against exercise settlement amounts to be paid to the clearing member to obtain a single
net settlement amount for cash-settled foreign currency option exercises with respect to each account.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 This is consistent with OCC practices respecting other foreign currency options. All exercise settlement amounts
will be paid within OCC's usual timeframes.

OCC states that the proposed changes to its By-Laws and Rules are consistent with the purposes and requirements of
section 17A of the Act, as amended, because they provide for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of transactions
in cash-settled foreign currency options. The proposed changes also are consistent with OCC's section 17A obligations
to safeguard funds and securities in its custody or control or for which it is responsible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of section 17A of the Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to registered clearing agencies. In particular,
sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F) of the Act require that a clearing agency be organized and that its rules be designed
to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to assure the safeguarding
of funds and securities within its custody or control or for which it is responsible.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Because OCC will apply rules and procedures comparable to those that it has used successfully in the clearance and
settlement of transactions in other established options products, OCC will satisfy its statutory obligations concerning
safeguarding. At the same time, OCC will provide clearance and settlement facilities for an innovative product to
the foreign currency market. Cash-settled foreign currency options should provide investors with an additional
means to hedge foreign currency portfolios against short-term market risk, should facilitate transactions in foreign
currency options, and should contribute to the maintenance of fair and orderly markets. OCC's clearance and settlement
of such options should promote their prompt and efficient clearance and settlement.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OCC also has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The Commission finds good cause for so approving because accelerated approval will permit OCC to coordinate its
clearance and settlement of cash-settled foreign currency options with the PHLX's listing of cash-settled foreign
currency options, which are proposed for February 7, 1994. The Commission believes that because OCC will be applying
procedures which have proved to be efficient and safe in the past, accelerated approval is justified. Furthermore,
no negative comments were received when the Commission published notice of filing of the PHLX proposed rule change.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to report the declaration of a dividend payable on January 20, 1994, to PTC's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

By letter dated March 27, 1989, from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board of Governors''),
PTC was prohibited from paying dividends to its stockholders. By letter dated June 9, 1992, from the Board of Governors,
PTC was relieved of the restriction on the payment of dividends on the understanding that dividends, if declared,
would be declared periodically by PTC's Board of Directors and paid at a rate not to exceed the 90-day United States
Treasury bill rate in effect at the time the dividend is declared. By order dated January 15, 1993,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 the Commission approved PTC's practice of paying such dividends out of net profits subject to the limitations imposed
by the Board of Governors and subject to the further requirements that (i) prior to using excess income from invested
principal and interest (``P&amp;I'') to pay a dividend, PTC's Board of Directors be advised of any amount related
to the investment of P&amp;I which has not been rebated and is part of the net profits used to declare the dividend, and
affirmatively approve the application of such excess P&amp;I income for the dividend, and (ii) PTC file a proposed
rule change pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act each time it declares a dividend. PTC paid its first dividend
on January 18, 1993, in the amount of $.52 per share, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December
31, 1992.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At its meeting of December 21, 1993, PTC's Board of Directors declared a dividend in the amount of $.525 per share, payable
on January 20, 1994, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 31, 1993. This dividend rate does
not exceed the 90-day United States Treasury bill rate in effect on December 21, 1993 (3.11%, as published in The Wall
Street Journal on December 21, 1993). The dividend does not include any excess income attributable to investments
of P&amp;I as all such P&amp;I related income with respect to fiscal year ended December 31, 1993 will be rebated to
participants, pro rata, based on the amount of P&amp;I disbursements to each participant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issuance of a dividend under these circumstances advances the requirements of fair representation of shareholders
and participants under Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act in that it provides an incentive for participants to invest
in PTC shares, and is also consistent with Section 17A(b)(3)(D) of the Act in that it provides for the equitable allocation
of reasonable fees and other charges among participants.

1. Most of the Trusts are series companies that may issue one or more series. Applicants request that relief be extended
to (a) each Trust and each of its series and (b) all other investment companies or series thereof that are, or in the future
will be, (i) advised by FMR (or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with FMR) or are, or in the
future will be, distributed by FDC or NFSC (or a person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with FDC
or NFSC) and that (ii) have or will have the ability to issue classes of shares that are identical in all material respects
to those described in the application (collectively with the Trusts and series thereof, the ``Funds'').

2. FMR acts as each Fund's investment manager and also provides the Funds with administrative services. FDC acts as
the distributor of all the Funds, other than the Funds for which NFSC services as distributor. NFSC currently acts
as the distributor to three Funds, each a series of the Daily Money Fund. FMR, FDC, and NFSC are all subsidiaries of FMC
Corp.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants previously requested an order under section 6(c) of the Act to permit the issuance and sale of an unlimited
number of classes of securities by the Funds (the ``Existing Order'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The Existing Order contained the following permissible class differences: (a) The impact of certain Class Expenses,
as Class Expenses are defined in the Existing Order; (b) the fact that classes will vote separately with respect to
the classes' Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan and/or Shareholder Services Plan, as both plans are defined in the Existing Order;
(c) exchange privileges of the classes of shares; and (d) the designation of each class of shares.

4. The Funds' existing classes of shares are sold subject to a front-end sales load and/or a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee. Applicants
now request the ability to offer shares that carry a standard or level load CDSC. The standard CDSC shares will not be
subject to a front-end sales load but will be subject to a CDSC and an annual rule 12b&hyph;1 and/or service fee. The
level load shares will have the same features as the standard CDSC shares except that the rule 12b&hyph;1 and/or service
fee could be different. Applicants also request the ability to have a conversion feature in connections with the shares
that carry a standard or level load CDSC. With this feature, these shares may, after a period of time, automatically
convert to shares of another class without the imposition of any additional sales charges and will be subject to the
lower rule 12b&hyph;1 fee and/or service fee applicable to that class. Applicants also request the ability to impose
a CDSC on the proceeds of certain redemptions of shares ordinarily subject to a front-end sales charge initially sold
without a sales charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the
net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase, or the amount that represents such percentage of the net asset
value of the shares at the time of redemption. As a result, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount which represents an increase
in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for the shares
when purchased. In determining the applicability and rate of any CDSC, it will be assumed that a redemption is made
first of shares representing reinvestment of the dividends and capital gain distributions, second of shares held
by the shareholder for a period equal to or greater than the CDSC period, and finally of other shares held by the shareholder
for the longest period of time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In accordance with rule 11a&hyph;3 under the Act, no CDSC will be imposed on any exchange by an investor of shares
with a CDSC for shares of another Fund. The sum of any front-end sales charge, asset based sales and CDSC paid by any individual
shareholder on a single investment will not exceed the maximum sales charge provided in article III, section 26 of
the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') Rules of Fair Practice.

7. The Funds request the ability to waive or reduce the CDSC in connection with the following redemptions of shares:
(a) Following death or disability, as defined in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''),
of a shareholder if redemption is made within one year after death or disability of a shareholder, as relevant; (b)
of retirement plan distributions which are permitted to be made without penalty pursuant to the Code, other than tax-free
rollovers or transfers of assets; (c) by current or former trustees or officers of a Fund, or current or retired officers,
directors or Fidelity trustees or employees, and by the spouse of such persons, or by a Fidelity trustee or employee
acting as custodian for a minor child, or a person acting as trustee of a trust for the sole benefit of the minor child
of a Fidelity trustee or employee; (d) by registered representatives, bank trust officers, and employees (and their
immediate families) of investment professionals that have entered into distribution-related agreements with
FDC or NFSC, (e) of shares made pursuant to a shareholder's participation in any systematic withdrawal plan adopted
by a Fund; (f) by large accountholders holding specified minimums of a Funds' shares; (g) those affected by advisory
accounts managed by FMR or any affiliated company, or by FMR or any such affiliated company itself; (h) those effected
tax-exempt employee benefit plans as a result of the enactment or promulgation of any law or regulation pursuant to
which continuation of the investment in the Funds would be improper; (i) those effected pursuant to each Fund's right
to liquidate a shareholder's account if the aggregate net asset value of shares held in the account is less than the
effective minimum account size; (j) by trust institutions investing on behalf of their clients; (k) by a charitable
organization (as defined in section 501(c)(3) of the Code); (l) by a charitable remainder trust or life income pool
established for the benefit of a charitable organization (as defined in section 501(c)(3) of the Code); (m) by any
state, county, or city, or any governmental instrumentality, department, authority, or agency; (n) of shares purchased
with redemption proceeds from other mutual fund complexes on which the investor has paid a front-end sales charge
only;
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 (o) of shares purchased by an insurance company separate account used to fund annuity contracts purchased by employee
benefit plans; (p) by investors participating in the Fidelity trust portfolios program; (q) of shares purchased
through Portfolio Advisory Services;
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 (r) of new or subsequent shares purchased in a Uniform Gifts to Minors/Uniform Transfers to Minors account; (s) redemptions
of shares purchased by contributions and exchanges to prototype or prototype-like retirement plans sponsored by

Fidelity Group IRA, the Fidelity 403(b) Program, the Fidelity Investments 401(a) Prototype Plan for Tax-Exempt
Employers, and the CORPORATEplan for Retirement);
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 (t) in accounts to which banks or broker-dealers which have agreements with FDC or NFSC charge an investment management
fee; (u) of shares purchased as part of an employee benefit plan maintained by an employer whose employee benefit plan
is either subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 or would be except for
specific statutory exemptions (``U.S. Employer''); (v) of shares purchased as part of an employee benefit plan maintained
by a US. Employer that is a member of a parent-subsidiary group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563(a)(1)
of the Code); (w) of shares purchased in a Fidelity IRA account purchased with the proceeds of a distribution from an
employee benefit plan, provided that at the time of the distribution, the employer or its affiliate had an account
of a specified size maintained with Fidelity; and (x) of shares purchased by a registered investment adviser purchasing
for its discretionary accounts, provided it has executed a Fidelity registered investment adviser agreement.

The Funds will take such steps as may be necessary to determine that a shareholder has not paid a CDSC or redemption fee
in connection with the redemption of shares of an unrelated open-end investment company, including, without limitation,
requiring a shareholder to provide a written representation that neither a CDSC nor redemption fee was imposed upon
the redemption and, in addition, either (a) requiring such shareholder to provide an activity statement reflecting
the redemption that supports the shareholder's representation, or (b) reviewing a copy of the current prospectus
of the unrelated open-end investment company and determining that such company does not impose a CDSC or redemption
fee.

A prototype retirement plan is a qualified pension or profit-sharing plan that can be separately adopted by an unlimited
number of employers, the form of which plan has been reviewed and approved by the Internal Revenue Service. A prototype-like
plan is a tax-deferred retirement savings vehicle, other than a qualified pension or profit-sharing plan for which
the Internal Revenue Service does not maintain the same type of review procedures as it does for qualified pension
or profit-sharing plans.

1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act
and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of the shares as described
above and to permit the Funds to waive the CDSC with respect to certain types of redemptions. Applicants believe that
the contingent nature of the proposed charge places the purchaser in a better position than if a sales load were imposed
at the time of sale, since in the case of the CDSC the shareholder enjoys the possibility that he or she will have to pay
only a reduced sales charge, or no sales charge at all. Applicants further believe that the imposition of the CDSC permits
the Funds' shareholders to have the advantage of greater investment dollars working for them from the time of their
purchase of shares of the Funds than if a sales load were imposed at the time of purchase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants also request an amendment to the Existing Order, which granted an exemption under section 6(c) from
sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), 18(i), to permit applicants to issue multiple classes of shares representing interests
in the same portfolio of securities. The amendment to the Existing Order would permit applicants to add a conversion
feature as a difference between classes of shares. Applicants believe that the conversion feature is equitable and
will not discriminate against any group of shareholders.

1. Each class of shares of a Fund will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments, and be identical in
all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of a Fund will relate solely
to one or more of the following: (a) The impact of certain Class Expenses, which are limited to any or all of the following
(i) transfer agent fee identified by applicants as being attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing
and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses,
and proxy statements to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class
of shares; (iv) Commission registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expense of administrative personnel
and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) trustees' fees or expenses incurred
as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; and (vii) accounting expenses relating solely to one class of
shares; (b) expenses assessed to a class pursuant to a Shareholder Services Plan and/or Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan with
respect to such class; (c) the fact that classes will vote separately with respect to the Fund's Shareholder Services
Plan and/or Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan, except as provided in conditions 16 and 17; (d) the different exchange privileges
of the classes of shares; (e) the designation of each class of shares of a Fund; and (f) the fact that certain classes
will have a conversion feature. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically identified above which are
subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares shall not be so allocated until
approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The trustees of the Funds, including a majority of the independent trustees, will approve the offering of different
classes of shares (the ``Multi-Class System'') prior to the implementation of that system by a particular Fund. The
minutes of the meetings of the trustees of the Funds regarding the deliberations of the trustees with respect to the
approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail the reasons for the trustees' determination
that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interests of both the Funds and their shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of trustees of the Trusts including a majority of
the trustees who are not interested persons of the Trusts. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition
of monies paid or payable by the Funds to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the board of trustees, and the trustees
shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures
were made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On an ongoing basis, the trustees of the Trusts, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and
otherwise, will monitor the Funds for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the classes of
shares. The trustees, including a majority of the independent trustees, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary
to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. Each Fund's distributor and adviser will be responsible for reporting
any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees. If a material conflict arises that the trustees determine cannot
be eliminated, the Fund's distributor and adviser, at their own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including
establishing a new registered management investment company.

5. The distributor of each Fund will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular
investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Shareholder Services Plan will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1
(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders
need to enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the Shareholder
Services Plans and Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plans and the related Service Agreements complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii)
of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable
to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged
to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees
to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based,
will be subject to the review and approval of the independent trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated
in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that Service Payments made
by a class under a Plan and any Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes
and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered
a report to applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the Commission, that such methodology and procedures
are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing
basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations
are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations
and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed
with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to
such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to provide), will be available for inspection
by the Commission staff upon written request to the Funds for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment
Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst,
and Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial
report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on the ``Design of a System'' as defined and described in SAS No.
44 of the AICPA. The ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating
effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar
auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

10. Applications have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial
report referred to in condition 9 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert,
on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 9 above. Applicants will take
immediate corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute
Expert.

entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing Fund shares may receive different compensation with respect
to one particular class of shares over another in the Funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the trustees
of the Trusts with respect to the Multi-Class System will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the trustees.

13. The Funds will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees,
sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus,
regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The Funds will disclose the respective
expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports
will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to the
Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class
basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent that any advertisement or sales literature describes
the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses
and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication
in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset value or public offering price will present each class of
shares separately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply Commission
approval, authorization of or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that any Fund may make pursuant to
its Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan or Shareholder Services Plan in reliance on the exemptive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act
Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted or amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target
Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales
load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge
and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in article III, section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any,
that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to
the conversion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. If a Fund implements any amendment to its Rule 12b&hyph;1 Plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements
any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that
may be borne by the Target Class shares under the plan, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target
Class unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The trustees shall
take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new
class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to Target Class as it existed prior to implementation
of the proposal, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class. If deemed
advisable by the trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase
Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material
respects except that New Purchase Class will convert into New Target Class. New Target Class or New Purchase Class
may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected
in a manner that the trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition
4 above, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase
Class shall be borne solely by FMR, and FDC or NFSC. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal
may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of
the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration
statement.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Equitable Variable is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States (``Equitable
Life''). Both companies are licensed to conduct business in all fifty states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and
the District of Columbia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. SA&hyph;1 and SA&hyph;FP are registered unit investment trusts under the 1940 Act. SA&hyph;1 funds Equitable's
scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts and SA&hyph;FP funds Equitable's flexible premium variable
life insurance contracts (``Equitable Variable Contracts''). The Equitable Variable Contracts are registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 (``1933 Act''). SA&hyph;1 has seven investment divisions (``SA&hyph;1 Divisions'')
and SA&hyph;FP has ten divisions (``SA&hyph;FP Divisions''). Each Division invests in shares of a corresponding
portfolio of the Hudson Trust. Therefore, SA&hyph;1 and SA&hyph;FP each have a Short-Term World Income Division
(``World Income Division''), that invests exclusively in shares of the World Income Portfolio, and an Intermediate
Government Securities Division (``Government Securities Division''), that invests exclusively in shares of the
Government Securities Portfolio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Hudson Trust is an open-end management investment company of the series type as described in Rule 18f&hyph;2
under the 1940 Act and has filed a registration statement under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act, which became effective
March 26, 1985. The Hudson Trust has twelve different portfolios (``Hudson Trust Portfolios'') that are used by the
corresponding SA&hyph;1 and SA&hyph;FP Divisions as investment vehicles in connection with the Contracts. The
Hudson Trust Portfolios are managed by Alliance Capital Management L.P. (``Alliance''), a subsidiary of ACMC, Inc.,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Equitable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. All shares of the World Income Portfolio currently are owned by the Separate Accounts. Of these shares, approximately
50% were acquired by Equitable Variable's general account in exchange for ``seed money'' contributed upon commencement
of the World Income Portfolio's operations on April 1, 1991. All other shares of this Portfolio are attributable to
Equitable Variable Contracts and are, thus, owned by the Separate Accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The fundamental investment objective of each of the World Income Portfolio and the Government Securities Portfolio
is high current income consistent with relative stability of principal through investment primarily in fixed income
securities. The World Income Portfolio invests in high quality short-term fixed income instruments denominated
in a variety of currencies, with at least 20% of its invested assets in U.S. dollar-denominated instruments. The Government
Securities Portfolio invests primarily in U.S. Government debt securities with secondary investments in repurchase
agreements and forward commitments related to U.S. Government Securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Total net assets as of June 30, 1993 were $289.3 million for the Government Securities Portfolio and $10.4 million
for the World Income Portfolio. There were 2,442 Contractowners participating in the World Income Divisions of the
Separate Accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The Hudson Trust pays Alliance an investment advisory fee at the following annual percentages of the value of each
Affected Portfolio's daily net assets:

Contractual provisions limiting fees and expenses to be paid under certain Equitable Variable Contracts existed
when Equitable Variable reorganized its separate accounts into unit investment trust form. Consequently, Equitable
Variable agreed to reimburse certain Divisions which invest in the Hudson Trust for the portion of advisory fees and
other Trust expenses that exceed the contractual limits set forth in these Contracts. These reimbursements are made
by Equitable Variable to such Divisions only in respect of owners of Equitable Variable Contracts that contain such
contractual expense limits. Expenses of owners of Equitable Variable Contracts that do not contain any such contractual
limits are not affected by the reimbursements. Because the reimbursements are prescribed by the relevant Contracts,
Equitable Variable's contractual reimbursement obligations will not be altered by the proposed Substitution.
The expenses of the Portfolios shown in the foregoing table are, therefore, not affected by these reimbursements.

9. The Hudson Trust's Board of Trustees and Equitable have determined that it is in the best interests of the shareholders
of the World Income Portfolio, and the Contractowners who have allocated premiums to the World Income Divisions,
to suspend operations of that Portfolio and the corresponding Divisions for the following reasons. The World Income
Portfolio's expenses, as noted above, are relatively high. Assets are small and declining from approximately $11.3
million on June 30, 1992 to approximately $10.4 million on June 30, 1993, even though Equitable Variable has maintained
its seed money investment of $5 million ($5.1 million as of June 30, 1993). Additionally, the World Income Portfolio
currently is in net redemption and, consequently, making its investment objective more difficult to achieve. This
Portfolio's performance relative to portfolios with similar investment objectives and investments has been below
the median, with a recent ranking of eighth of eight world income funds for the one year period ended June 30, 1993. The
proposed Substitution will, therefore, eliminate a Hudson Trust Portfolio that, because of its small size, is expected
to be unable to reduce its operating expenses in the foreseeable future, that has not historically been able to produce
competitive yields and returns, and that, because of those expenses and net redemptions, is expected to find it increasingly
difficult to achieve competitive investment results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Equitable Variable thus proposes to substitute shares of the Government Securities Portfolio for shares of the
World Income Portfolio. The Separate Accounts will redeem, partly for cash and partly for securities as a redemption
in-kind, all shares of the World Income Portfolio attributable to Contractowners at the close of business on the date
selected for the Substitution. Redemptions in-kind of securities held by the World Income Portfolio will be executed
to the extent that the securities have characteristics consistent with the investment objectives and diversification
requirements of the Government Securities Portfolio. Equitable Variable will request Alliance to review such securities
selected for redemption in-kind to assure that such securities are suitable investments for the Government Securities
Portfolio. Applicants have determined that effecting redemption of shares of the World Income Portfolio and the
purchase of shares of the Government Securities Portfolio partially in cash and partially for securities is appropriate,
based on the overlap between the U.S. dollar-denominated portfolio securities of the World Income Portfolio and
the shorter-term securities eligible for purchase by the Government Securities Portfolio. Securities redeemed
in-kind will be valued in accordance with generally accepted accounting practices and all applicable laws and regulations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Separate Accounts will use the securities redeemed in-kind and the cash proceeds received on redemption of the
World Income Portfolio's shares to purchase shares of the Government Securities Portfolio. The World Income Portfolio
will process the redemption request, and the Government Securities Portfolio will process the purchase order, at
prices based on the current net asset values next computed after receipt of the request and order and, therefore, in
a manner consistent with Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
22c&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act. Investments of Contractowners in the Separate Accounts will at all times be fully invested,
the value of such investments will not be changed by the Substitution, and the investment by the Government Securities
Divisions of the Separate Accounts will not be diluted. On the business day following the Substitution, or as soon
thereafter as is consistent with the stated purposes of the proposed transaction, Equitable Variable will redeem
entirely for cash shares of the World Income Portfolio constituting its seed money.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. Contractowners will bear none of the transaction costs triggered by the redemption in connection with the Substitution.
The full net asset value of the redeemed shares held by the Separate Accounts will be reflected in the Contractowners'
unit values following the Substitution. Any costs of liquidating the assets of the World Income Portfolio for the
redemption that is part of the Substitution will be reflected in the next asset value at which Equitable Variable subsequently
redeems its shares of that Portfolio. All other expenses of the Substitution will be borne by Equitable Variable and
Alliance. Accordingly, the costs associated with the Substitution will not be borne, directly or indirectly, by
the Contractowner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Contractowners will be given prior notice of the proposed Substitution and will have the option of transferring
the portion of the value of their contract (``Policy Value'') allocable to the World Income Portfolio to any other
Portfolio of the Hudson Trust, without charge. Otherwise, amounts allocated to the World Income Portfolio will be
transferred to the Government Securities Portfolio, also without charge. All contractowners have received a prospectus
describing the policies of the Hudson Trust and its Portfolios and have all information needed to make a decision with
respect to reallocating the respective portion of their Policy Value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within five (5) days after the Substitution, Equitable Variable also will send to Contractowners indirectly investing
in the World Income Portfolio written notice of the Substitution indicating that shares of the World Income Portfolio
have been eliminated and shares of the Government Securities Portfolio have been substituted. Equitable Variable
will include in such mailing a supplement to the prospectus of the Hudson Trust that discloses the completion of the
Substitution or an updated prospectus, as appropriate. Contractowners will be advised in the Second Notice that
they may transfer the Policy Value allocable to the Government Securities Portfolio, as substituted, to any other
available Divisions investing in the other Hudson Trust Portfolios, without limitation, without charge and at any
time. The Substitution will not be counted as a transfer under any contractual provisions of the Equitable Variable
Contracts that limit allowable transfers. Following the Substitution, Contractowners will be afforded the same
contract rights that they currently have, including surrender and other transfer rights with regard to amounts invested
under the Equitable Variable Contracts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Applicants request that the Commission issue an order under sections 17(b) and 26(b) of the 1940 Act to the extent
necessary to permit the substitution of shares of the Government Securities Portfolio for shares of the World Income
Portfolio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 26(b) of the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding
the security of a single issuer:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
*&blank;*&blank;* to substitute another security for such security unless the Commission shall have approved such
substitution. The Commission shall issue an order approving such substitution if the evidence establishes that
it is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of
this title.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Equitable believes the Substitution is consistent with the interests of the owners of the Contracts. Both Portfolios
have the same underwriter and investment adviser. Notwithstanding investments in different instruments, their
investment objectives are substantially similar in that each seeks high current income consistent with relative
stability of principal through investment in fixed income securities. Additionally, management fees indirectly
paid by the Contractowners after the Substitution will be lower than those incurred prior to the Substitution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Additionally, the Substitution is expected to confer economic benefits on Contractowners because: (a) The World
Income Portfolio's expenses and net redemptions are expected to make it increasingly difficult for that Portfolio
to achieve competitive results; (b) operation of the consolidated Affected Portfolios will result in economies
of scale and reduced operating expenses as a result of lower management fees paid by the Government Securities Portfolio;
and (c) the size of the Government Securities Portfolio, its competitive return and its historically higher total
return and yield suggest that it will offer a more favorable opportunity for achieving a substantially similar investment
objective with more competitive results that the World Income Portfolio has been able to achieve, relative to other
competitive funds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Contracts reserve to Equitable Variable the right to replace the shares of one Hudson Trust Portfolio held by
the Separate Accounts with shares of another Hudson Trust Portfolio or with another registered investment company,
subject to Commission approval. The substitution right is disclosed in the Separate Accounts' prospectuses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Contractowners will incur no transfer fees in connection with the Substitution. The Substitution will have no
adverse federal income tax consequences for the Contractowners. Additionally, the Substitution will in no way alter
the insurance benefits to Contractowners or the contractual obligations of Equitable Variable. Contractowners
will continue to look to Equitable Variable with regard to their rights under the Equitable Variable Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicants consent to the following terms of and the conditions to the issuance of an order granting an exemption
under section 26(b):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Shares of the Government Securities Portfolio will be substituted for shares of the World Income Portfolio, whose
investment objective is substantially similar to the investment objective of the Government Securities Portfolio;

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
b. If a Contractowner that has allocated premiums to the World Income Divisions requests a reallocation of shares
before May 1, 1994, the Policy Value of the Contractowner's Equitable Variable Contract will be reallocated for investment
to another Hudson Trust Portfolio selected by the Contractowner at no cost to the Contractowner;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The Substitution will, in all cases, be at net asset value of the respective shares, without the imposition of any
transfer or similar charge;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Any expenses and transaction costs triggered by the redemption in connection with the Substitution (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, brokerage commissions, custodial fees, accounting fees, etc.) and which are reflected in the net asset value of
the World Income Portfolio shares will be assumed by Equitable as the sole remaining shareholder of the World Income
Portfolio. Equitable and Alliance will bear all other expenses of the Substitution, including legal and accounting
fees and expenses, the cost of prospectus disclosure, this Application and Notices;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. The Substitution will not be treated as a transfer for purposes of any provisions of the Equitable Variable Contracts
that limit allowable transfers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. The Substitution will in no way alter the insurance benefits to Contractowners or the contractual obligations
of Equitable Variable; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. The Substitution will not alter the tax benefits to Contractowners or cause any adverse tax consequences to Contractowners.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants also request an order of the Commission under section 17(b) of the 1940 Act exempting them from the provisions
of section 17(a) of the 1940 Act in connection with aspects of the Substitution that may be deemed to be prohibited by
section 17(a). Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company,
or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal, from selling any security or other property to that company.
Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits such affiliated persons from purchasing any security or other property
from the registered investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Substitution may result in transactions prohibited by section 17(a) because of affiliations among the Government
Securities Divisions, the World Income Divisions, and the corresponding Trust Portfolios. The Substitution specifically
may be deemed to include one or more purchases or sales of securities between the World Income Divisions and the Government
Securities Portfolio because the World Income Divisions will purchase shares of the Government Securities Portfolio
with the securities received by these Divisions in connection with the redemption in-kind of shares of the World Income
Portfolio. Similar issues may arise in connection with the redemption in-kind itself and the consolidation of the
Divisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 17(b) of the 1940 Act provides that the Commission shall, upon application, grant an order exempting a proposed
transaction otherwise prohibited by Section 17(a) if evidence establishes that: (a) The terms of the proposed transaction,
including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the
part of any person concerned; (b) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of each registered investment
company concerned, as recited in its registration statements and reports filed under the 1940 Act; and (c) the proposed
transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act. The Applicants represent that the proposed Substitution
satisfies these tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. First, the terms of the Substitution are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person
concerned. The Substitution will be effected pursuant to the Hudson Trust's procedures for valuing portfolio securities
and portfolio securities of the Affected Portfolios are and will be valued in a consistent manner.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 17a&hyph;7 under the 1940 Act permits a purchase or sale transaction between registered investment companies
or separate series of registered investment companies which may be affiliated persons, or affiliated persons of
affiliated persons, solely by reason of having a common investment adviser or investment advisers which are affiliated
persons of each other, common directors and/or common officers, subject to certain specified conditions. However,
the Substitution will involve the redemption by the World Income Portfolio of securities in-kind rather than for
cash and, therefore, will not meet the requirements of subsection (a) of Rule 17a&hyph;7. Nevertheless, the Substitution
will comply with subsections (b), (c) and (d) of Rule 17a&hyph;7 because the transactions: will be effected at the
independent current market price, including, where appropriate, amortized cost, of the securities involved; is
consistent with the policies of the Government Securities Portfolio and the Government Securities Divisions; and
will not involve the payment of any brokerage commission, fee or other remuneration. Applicants believe, moreover,
that the proposed transactions satisfy the intent of Rule 17a&hyph;7 and that, consequently, there will be no overreaching
because all securities redeemed in-kind and used to purchase shares of the Government Securities Portfolio will
be consistently valued for all purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Second, the proposed Substitution is consistent with the investment policies of both Affected Portfolios because
securities received by the Separate Account from the World Income Portfolio from redemptions in-kind will be selected
by Alliance to correspond to the investment policies of the Government Securities Portfolio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Third, the Substitution is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act because it will provide Contractowners
those economic and other benefits discussed herein.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants submit that the exemptive relief requested under section 26(b) of the 1940 Act is necessary and appropriate
in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies
and provisions of the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants further submit that the exemptive relief requested under section 17(b) is appropriate because the
terms of the proposed Substitution, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and
do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy
of each registered investment company concerned with the Substitution, as recited in their registration statements
and reports filed under the 1940 Act, and the Substitution is consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Accordingly the Applicants request that the Commission grant the necessary exemptions and approvals pursuant
to sections 17(b) and 26(b) of the 1940 Act permitting the Substitution.

1. United of Omaha is a stock life insurance company that was incorporated under the name of United Benefit Life Insurance
Company under the Laws of Nebraska on August 9, 1926. In 1981, the company changed its name to United of Omaha Life Insurance
Company. United of Omaha is engaged principally in the sale of life insurance, accident and health insurance, and
annuity policies, and it is licensed in all states (including the District of Columbia) other than New York. United
of Omaha is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Variable Account was established as a separate investment account under the laws of Nebraska on December 1,
1993 pursuant to a resolution of United of Omaha's Board of Directors. Under Nebraska law, the assets of the Variable
Account are owned by United of Omaha but are held separately from United of Omaha's other assets and are not chargeable
with any liabilities arising out of any other separate investments account or any other business of United of Omaha
that has no specific and determinable relation to or dependence upon the Variable Account. The income, gains, or losses,
realized or unrealized, from assets allocated to the Variable Account are credited to or charged against the Variable
Account without regard to other income, gains, or losses of United of Omaha.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Variable Account will invest in shares of one or more of the investment portfolios of the Variable Insurance
Products Fund, the Variable Insurance Products Fund II, the Scudder Variable Life Investment Fund, and such other
registered investment companies as United of Omaha may make available under the Policies from time to time (each,
a ``Fund''). Each Fund will be a diversified, open-end management investment company, and may have a number of classes
or series.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. MOIS will serve as the distributor and principal underwriter of certain of the Policies. MOIS is registered under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer, and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. Broker-dealers other than MOIS may also serve as distributors and principal underwriters of certain of the Policies,
to the extent the Policies are sold through alternate distribution channels. Any such other broker-dealer will be
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and will be a member of the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. The requested order would apply to any such other broker-dealer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Policies may be purchased with an initial purchase payment of $5000 on a non-tax qualified basis or in connection
with retirement plans or individual retirement accounts that qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment.
A Policy owner may make additional purchase payments of at least $500 each at any time prior to the annuity starting
date. A Policy owner can allocate net purchase payments to United of Omaha's Fixed Account and to one or more subaccounts
of the Variable Account. The minimum amount that may be allocated is $500. Several annuity payout options are available
to Policy owners. In the event that the Policy owner dies prior to the annuity starting date, a death benefit is payable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. United of Omaha will deduct a Policy fee of $30 each Policy year. This charge will be deducted at the end of each Policy
year prior to the annuity starting date (and upon a complete surrender) to compensate United of Omaha for the administrative
services provided to Policy owners. Currently, this fee is waived if the Policy's accumulation value exceeds $50,000.
United of Omaha also deducts a daily administrative expense charge from the assets of each subaccount of the Variable
Account. This charge is equal to an effective annual rate of .15% of the net assets of the subaccount. United of Omaha
imposes no charge for the first twelve transfers in any Policy year, but may impose a $10 fee for the thirteenth and each
subsequent transfer. A withdrawal processing fee equal to the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount withdrawn will be imposed
for the second and each subsequent partial withdrawal request during a single Policy year, including certain withdrawals
that are applied to provide annuity payments. However, the withdrawal processing fee will not be deducted on the annuity
starting date if the accumulation value is applied after the second Policy anniversary to provide lifetime annuity
payments. United of Omaha does not anticipate making any profit from these four charges, none of which will be increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In order to permit investment of the entire purchase payment (net of any applicable premium tax charge), United
of Omaha does not deduct sales charges at the time of investment. However, a contingent deferred sales charge of up
to 7% is imposed on certain full or partial Policy surrenders during the first seven years after a purchase payment
is made to cover expenses relating to the sale of the Policies, including commissions to registered representatives
and other promotional expenses. During the first year after a purchase payment, the withdrawal charge is 7% of the
amount withdrawn. The charge declines 1% per year for older purchase payments withdrawn, and becomes 0% in the eighth
and subsequent years. Each year, the Policy owner can withdraw up to 10% of total purchase payments (less any previous
withdrawals), without imposition of the withdrawal charge. In addition, the withdrawal charge is waived in certain
cases. United of Omaha does not anticipate that the withdrawal charge will generate sufficient revenues to pay the
cost of distributing the Policies. If this charge is insufficient to cover the distribution expenses, the deficiency
will be met from the general account assets of United of Omaha, which may include amounts derived from the charge for
mortality and expense risks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. United of Omaha seeks to impose a daily charge to compensate it for bearing certain mortality and expense risks in
connection with the Policies. This charge is equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the value of the net assets
in the Variable Account, and it will not increase. Of that amount, approximately three-fourths is attributable to
mortality risks, and approximately one-fourth is attributable to expense risks. If the mortality and expense risk
charge is insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks, the loss will fall on United of Omaha. Conversely,
if the charge is more than sufficient to cover costs, any excess will be profit to United of Omaha.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The mortality risk borne by United of Omaha arises from its obligation to make periodic annuity payments regardless
of how long all annuitants may live and from its obligation to pay a death benefit that may be greater than the Policy's
accumulation value. The expense risk assumed by United of Omaha is that its actual administrative costs will exceed
the amount recovered through the administrative charges.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request that the Commission, pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act, grant exemptions from the provisions
described below to the extent necessary to permit the assessment of the daily charge for mortality and expense risks.
Applicants state that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants state further that
the proposed mortality and expense risk charge is consistent with the protection of investors because it is a reasonable
and proper insurance charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 26(a)(2)(C) of the Act provides that no payment to the depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a registered
unit investment trust shall be allowed the trustee or custodian as an expense except compensation, not exceeding
such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative duties
normally performed by the trustee or custodian. Section 27(c)(2) prohibits a registered investment company or a
depositor or underwriter for such company from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of
all payments on such certificates, other than sales loads, are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the qualifications
prescribed in section 26(a)(1), and are held by such trustee or custodian under an agreement containing substantially
the provisions required by sections 26(a)(2) and 26(a)(3) of the Act. Applicants request an exemptive order because
the proposed mortality and expense risk charge is not a bookkeeping or administrative charge allowed by sections
26(a)(2) and 27(c)(2).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. United of Omaha represents that the mortality and expense risk charge is a reasonable charge to compensate it for
assuming the risk that annuitants under the Policies will live longer as a group than had been anticipated in setting
the annuity rates guaranteed in the Policies; for the risk that the accumulation value will be less than the death benefit;
and for the risk that administrative expenses will be greater than amounts derived from the administrative charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. United of Omaha represents that the charge of 1.25% for mortality and expense risks is within the range of industry
practice with respect to comparable annuity products. This representation is based upon United of Omaha's analysis
of publicly available information about similar industry products, taking into consideration such factors as current
charge levels, the existence of charge level guarantees, and guaranteed annuity rates. United of Omaha will maintain
at its administrative offices, available to the Commission, a memorandum setting forth in detail the products analyzed
in the course of, and the methodology and results of, its comparative survey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. United of Omaha has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements
will benefit the Variable Account and the Policy owners. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum
which will be maintained by United of Omaha at its administrative offices and will be available to the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. United of Omaha also represents that the Variable Account will only invest in management investment companies
which undertake, in the event such company adopts a plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 to finance distribution expenses,
to have a board of directors (or trustees), a majority of whom are not interested persons of the company, formulate
and approve any such plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants request exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) to the extent necessary to permit them to deduct
on a daily basis a charge equal to 1.25% annually of the assets of the Variable Account for the assumption of mortality
and expense risks described herein. For the reasons set forth above, Applicants believe that the exemptions requested
are necessary and appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Fund is an open-end management investment company registered under the Act. The Fund is a series company currently
composed of seven series: The Alger Money Market Portfolio, the Alger Income and Growth Portfolio, the Alger Small
Capitalization Portfolio, the Alger Growth Portfolio, the Alger Balanced Portfolio, the Alger MidCap Growth Portfolio,
and the Alger Leveraged AllCap Portfolio (collectively, the ``Portfolios''). The Distributor is the distributor
for the Fund.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. In 1986, the Commission issued an order to the Fund to permit the Fund to impose a CDSC on certain redemptions of shares
of the Portfolios and waive the CDSC in certain instances (the ``Prior Order'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In 1987, the Prior Order was amended to include an additional waiver category (together with the Prior Order, the ``Prior
Orders'').
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 The present application seeks to expand the circumstances under which the Fund may waive the CDSC. The order sought
by this application will, if issued, supersede the Prior Orders.

3. No CDSC is imposed upon the redemption of shares of a Portfolio to the extent that the net asset value of the shares
redeemed does not exceed (a) the current net asset value of shares purchased more than six years prior to the redemption,
plus (b) the current net asset value of shares purchased through reinvestment of dividends or capital gains distributions,
plus (c) increases in the net asset value of the shares above purchase payments made with respect to a Portfolio during
the preceding six years. The amount of the CDSC depends on the number of years that the shareholder has held the shares
from which an amount is being redeemed. The Fund assesses no CDSC on exchanges of shares among Portfolios.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In accordance with the terms of the Prior Orders, the Fund waives the CDSC on the following redemptions: (a) Any partial
or total redemption of shares of a shareholder who dies or becomes disabled, so long as the redemption is requested
within one year of death or initial determination of disability; (b) any partial or complete redemption in connection
with certain distributions from Individual Retirement Accounts (``IRAs'') or other qualified retirement plans;
(c) redemptions effected pursuant to the Fund's automatic cash withdrawal plan of amounts up to 2% of the value of a
shareholder's shares in a Portfolio at the time the withdrawal plan commences; (d) redemptions effected by (i) employees
of Alger Associates, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (ii) IRAs, Keogh plans and employee benefit plans for those employees,
and trusts of which those individuals are beneficiaries, as long as orders for the Fund's shares on behalf of those
individuals and trusts are placed by the employees; (e) redemptions effected by (i) accounts managed by investment
advisory subsidiaries of Alger Associates, Inc. that are registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, (ii)
employees, participants and beneficiaries of those accounts, (iii) IRAs, Keogh plans and employee benefit plans
for those employees, participants and beneficiaries and (iv) spouses and minor children of those employees, participants
and beneficiaries as long as orders for the Fund's shares are placed by the employees, participants and beneficiaries;
(f) redemptions effected by directors or trustees or any investment company for which Alger Associates, Inc. or any
of its subsidiaries serves as investment adviser or distributor; (g) redemptions effected by an investment company
registered under the Act in connection with the combination of the investment company with the Fund by merger, acquisition
of assets or by any other transaction; (h) redemptions effected pursuant to the Fund's right to liquidate involuntarily
a shareholder's account in any Portfolio with a current value of less than $250; and (i) redemptions of shares of the
Portfolios held through defined contribution plans with respect to which Fred Alger Management, Inc. or an affiliate
thereof provides certain non-fiduciary services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Fund also offers a one-time only reinvestment privilege under which a shareholder who redeems shares subject
to the CDSC and reinvests the proceeds of the redemption within 30 days after the redemption will receive a credit against
the amount of the CDSC paid. The percentage of the CDSC credited to the shareholder is the same as the percentage of the
redemption proceeds that are reinvested. The Distributor will pay any credit from its own assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In the present application, applicants also propose to waive the CDSC on redemptions effected by registered investment
advisers, banks and trust companies and other financial institutions exercising discretionary authority with
respect to the money invested in Fund shares and on redemptions effected by registered investment advisers for their
own account.

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The requested exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants believe that the
additional waiver is appropriate because shares of a Portfolio with respect to which the CDSC would be waived are purchased
with little or no selling effort or expense. In addition, the waiver will encourage sales of the Fund's shares which
will be beneficial to all the Fund's shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Waiving the CDSC is consistent with the policies underlying section 22(d) of the Act, which prohibits an investment
company registered under the Act from selling its redeemable securities other than at a current public offering price
described in the company's prospectus. The waiver will not result in the occurrence of any of the abuses to which section
22(d) is directed and will not harm the Fund or its shareholders or unfairly discriminate among shareholders or purchasers.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

2. FRIMCo is the administrator, and the RFD is the distributor of Laurel Fund. Mellon Bank is Laurel Fund's investment
adviser, custodian, and transfer agent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

for TBC Fund, TBCIS Fund, and TBCTF Fund. The Boston Company Advisors, Inc. is an indirect subsidiary of Mellon Bank
Corporation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants request that the relief granted hereby apply to all existing and future portfolios of Laurel Fund, TBC
Fund, TBCIS Fund, and TBCTF Fund (the ``Portfolios''), and to all future registered investment companies distributed
by RFD or FDI, or for which Mellon Bank serves in the future as investment adviser, or for which any person controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with Mellon Bank (within the meaning of section 2(a)(9) of the Act) may in the
future serve as investment adviser. Any such future investment companies that rely on the requested relief will abide
by all of the representations and conditions to the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Portfolios consist of both money market funds and non-money market funds. Shares of the Portfolios are sold
and redeemed daily at net asset value without a sales or redemption charge. The Funds have adopted plans pursuant to
rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act for using up to 0.35% of each Portfolio's net assets annually to aid in the distribution
of their shares.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants propose to create a multi-class distribution system (the ``Multi-Class System''). The Funds will
create an unlimited number of additional classes of shares in some or all of their existing and future Portfolios.
Shares will be issued in connection with either a plan adopted pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act (the ``12b&hyph;1
Plan'') and/or a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 administrative plan (the ``Administrative Plan,'' and collectively with
the 12b&hyph;1 Plan, the ``Plans'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. With respect to each class of shares, the Funds will enter into a 12b&hyph;1 Plan agreement and/or an Administrative
Plan agreement (the ``Plan Agreements'') with groups, organizations or institutions (``Organizations'') to provide
certain services to the clients, members, or customers of such Organizations who beneficially own shares offered
in connection with a particular class (``Class Shareholders'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The services to be provided by Organizations to their Class Shareholders under the 12b&hyph;1 Plan could include:
providing facilities to answer questions from prospective investors about the Funds; receiving and answering correspondence,
including requests for prospectuses and statements of additional information; preparing, printing, and delivering
prospectuses and shareholder reports to prospective Class Shareholders; complying with federal and state securities
laws pertaining to the sale of shares; and assisting investors in completing application forms and selecting dividend
and other account options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The services to be provided by Organizations to their Class Shareholders under the Administrative Plan could include:
receiving, aggregating, and processing Class Shareholder orders; sweep program servicing; shareholder sub-accounting;
providing and maintaining elective Class Shareholder services such as check writing and wire transfer services;
providing and maintaining pre-authorized investment plans; periodic communications with Class Shareholders;
acting as the sole shareholder of record and nominee for Class Shareholders; maintaining account records for Class
Shareholders; answering questions and handling correspondence from Class Shareholders about their accounts;
issuing confirmations for transactions by Class Shareholders; and similar account administrative services.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. The services provided pursuant to the Plans will augment or replace (and not be duplicative of) the services to
be provided to the Portfolios by Mellon Bank, the Distributors, or FRIMCo. Applicants propose to ``unbundle'' services
provided to the Portfolios to permit Organizations to select services they wish to provide to their Class Shareholders,
with such services to be tailored to their Class Shareholders' needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. With respect to each class of shares, a Portfolio will pay an Organization for its services and assistance in accordance
with the terms of its Plan and related Plan Agreement (``Plan Payments'') and the expense of such payments will be borne
entirely by the owners of the class of shares of the Portfolio to which each Plan Agreement relates. Plan Payments will
not exceed 0.50% per year of the average daily net asset value of shares owned by Class Shareholders covered by such
Plan Agreement. In addition, for any Organization having both a 12b&hyph;1 Plan and Administrative Plan, aggregate
Plan Payments will not exceed 1.00% per year. Such maximum limits on Plan Payments might be increased in the future,
upon compliance with the provisions of the related Plan, but will not be increased over the limits stated above unless
the requested exemptive order is amended, or a no-action position obtained from the SEC staff permitting such increase.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Applicants at all times will comply with Article III, section 26 of the Rules of Fair Practice of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc., as amended, with respect to asset-based distribution charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. All expenses of the Funds that cannot be attributed directly to any one Portfolio (``Fund Expenses'') will be allocated
to each Portfolio based on the relative net assets of such Portfolio. Fund Expenses could include, for example, directors'
fees and expenses, audit and legal fees, insurance premiums, SEC and state blue sky registration fees, and dues paid
to organizations such as the Investment Company Institute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Certain expenses may be attributable to a Portfolio, but not to a particular class (``Portfolio Expenses'').
Portfolio Expenses will be allocated to a class based upon the relative percentage of net assets of such class. Portfolio
expenses could include, for example, advisory fees, accounting fees, custodian fees, and fees related to preparation
of separate documents of the Portfolio. In addition, the gross income of each Portfolio will be allocated on a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis to each class based on the relative net assets of each class, and then divided by the number of outstanding shares
in each class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. In addition to the cost of Plan Payments, each class will bear certain expenses attributable specifically to such
class, as set forth in Condition 1 (``Class Expenses''). The determination of which Class Expenses will be allocated
to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be determined by the Board of Directors of the Fund in
the manner described in Condition 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. The Funds' investment adviser may choose to reimburse or waive Class Expenses on certain classes on a voluntary,
temporary basis. The amount of Class Expenses waived or reimbursed by the investment adviser may vary from class to
class. Class Expenses are by their nature specific to a given class and obviously expected to vary from one class to
another. Applicants thus believe that it is acceptable and consistent with shareholder expectations to reimburse
or waive Class Expenses at different levels for different classes of the same portfolio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. In addition, the investment adviser may waive or reimburse Fund Expenses and/or Portfolio Expenses (with or without
a waiver or reimbursement of Class Expenses) but only if the same proportionate amount of Fund Expenses and/or Portfolio
Expenses are waived or reimbursed for each class. Thus, any Fund Expenses that are waived or reimbursed would be credited
to each class of a Portfolio based on the relative net assets of the classes. Similarly, any Portfolio Expenses that
are waived or reimbursed would be credited to each class of that Portfolio according to the relative net assets of the
classes. Fund Expenses and Portfolio Expenses apply equally to all classes of a given Portfolio. Accordingly, it
may not be appropriate to waive or reimburse Fund Expenses or Portfolio Expenses at different levels for different
classes of the same Portfolio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Dividends paid to each class of shares will be declared and paid on the same days and at the same times, and except
as noted below, will be determined in the same manner and paid in the same amounts. Because different Plan Payments
and Class Expenses may be borne by each class of shares, the net income of (and dividends payable to) each class may be
different from the net income of the other classes of shares of a Portfolio.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
19. Applicants also request an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c) and 22(d), of the Act and rule 22c-1
thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit the Funds to assess a CDSC on certain redemptions of shares, and waive
the CDSC in certain instances. The amount of the CDSC charged will vary, depending on the length of time shares have
been held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. The CDSC typically will range from 4% to 6% (but can be higher or lower) on shares redeemed in the first year of purchase
and will be reduced, typically at a rate of 1% per year over the applicable CDSC period, so that redemptions of shares
held after that period will not be subject to a CDSC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of shares purchased in connection with the reinvestment of distributions.
Furthermore, no CDSC will be imposed on an amount which represents an increase in the value of a shareholder's account
resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC period. In determining
whether a CDSC is applicable, a redemption will be made first of shares derived from reinvestment of distributions,
second of shares purchased prior to the CDSC period, and third of shares purchased during the CDSC period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. The Portfolios will waive the CDSC on redemptions: (a) following a shareholder's death or disability, as defined
in section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code, (b) in connection with distributions from an individual retirement
account or other qualified retirement plan following death, total or permanent disability, or reaching retirement
age, and (c) in whole or in part in connection with shares sold to: (i) Customers of Mellon Bank Corporation, its subsidiaries,
and affiliates (``Mellon Bank Corp.''), and The Boston Company, its subsidiaries (including The Boston Company
Advisors, Inc.) and affiliates (``The Boston Company''), (ii) directors and officers of the Funds, and (iii) employees
and retirees of Mellon Bank Corp., The Boston Company, the Distributors, and FRIMCo, as disclosed in the registration
statement for the class.

Applicants' Legal Analysis: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants seek an exemptive order to the extent that the Multi-Class System might be deemed to (a) result in a ``senior
security'' within the meaning of section 18(g) of the Act, and thus be prohibited by section 18(f)(1); and (b) violate
the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 18 is intended to prevent investment companies from issuing excessive amounts of senior securities and
thereby increasing unduly the speculative character of their junior securities, or from operating without adequate
assets or reserves. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings and does not affect the Portfolios' existing
assets or reserves. Nor will the proposed arrangement increase the speculative character of the shares of a Portfolio
since all shares will participate 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in all of a Portfolio's income and expenses, with the exception of Plan Payments and Class Expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights is equitable and will not discriminate against any group
of shareholders. Further, since all shares of a Portfolio will be redeemable at all times, no class of shares will have
any preference or priority in the usual sense (that is, no class will have distribution or liquidation preferences
will respect to particular assets, and no class will be protected by any reserve or other account). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants believe that the imposition of the CDSC is fair, consistent with the policy and provisions of the Act,
and in the best interest of those shareholders on whom it is imposed. Shares sold subject to a CDSC will be designed to
permit the investor to purchase shares without the assessment of a front-end sales load, and at the same time permit
the Distributors to pay securities dealers selling shares of a class a commission on the sale of those shares. Proceeds
from the CDSC will be used in whole or in part to defray the expenses of the Distributors and of the selling broker-dealers
relating to providing distribution-related services to the investor choosing those classes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Each class of shares of a Portfolio will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments, and be identical
in all respects, except for differences related to: (a) Certain Class Expenses, which are limited to: (i) Transfer
agent fees identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class of shares; (ii) printing and
postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and
proxies to current shareholders of a specific class; (iii) blue sky registration fees incurred by a class of shares;
(iv) SEC registration fees incurred by a class of shares; (v) the expense of the Funds' administrator and other administrative
personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; (vi) litigation or other legal
expenses relating solely to one class of shares; (vii) directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one
class of shares; and (viii) organizational expenses incurred to establish a particular class of shares; (b) expenses
assessed to a class pursuant to a 12b&hyph;1 Plan or Administrative Plan; (c) voting rights as to matters exclusively
affecting one class of shares; (d) dividend and net asset value differences reflecting different Plan Payments and
Class Expenses; (e) class designation; and (f) exchange privileges. Any additional incremental expenses not specifically
identified above which are subsequently identified and determined to be properly allocated to one class of shares
shall not be so allocated until approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The directors of the Funds, including a majority of the independent directors will approve the offering of different
classes of shares pursuant to the Multi-Class System. The minutes of the meetings of the directors regarding the deliberations
of the directors with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multi-Class System will reflect in detail
the reasons for the directors' determination that the proposed Multi-Class System is in the best interests of the
Funds, the Portfolios, and shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The initial determination of the Class Expenses, if any, that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent
changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the board of directors of the Funds, including a majority
of the independent directors. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable
by a Portfolio to meet Class Expenses shall provide to the board of directors, and the directors shall review, at least
quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On an ongoing basis, the directors, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise,
will monitor the Portfolios for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the various classes
of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, shall take such action as is reasonably
necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The investment adviser and distributor of the Funds will
be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the investment
adviser and the distributor at their own cost will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered
management investment company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Distributors will adopt compliance standards as to when each class of shares may be sold to particular investors.
Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Administrative Plans will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b)
through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need
not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The directors will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the Administrative
Plans and 12b&hyph;1 Plans and the related Plan Agreements complying with paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1,
as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing
of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures
not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee attributable
to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and
approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. Dividends paid by a Portfolio with respect to a class of shares will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time,
on the same day, and will be in the same per share amount as dividends paid by that Portfolio with respect to each other
class of shares of the Portfolio, except that Plan Payments made by a class under its Plan and any Class Expenses will
be borne exclusively by the affected class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various
classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who
has rendered a report to the applicants, which report has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology
and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner.
On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations
and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that
the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic
reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect
to such reports, following request by the Funds (which the Funds agrees to provide), will be available for inspection
by the SEC staff upon written request by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or a regional office
of the SEC. Authorized staff members will be limited to the director, an associate director, the chief accountant,
the chief financial analyst, an assistant director, and any regional administrators or associate and assistant
administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``Special Purpose'' report on the ``Design of a System'' as defined
and described in Statement of Auditing Standards (``SAS'') No. 44 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(``AICPA'') and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of
effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar
auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time.

10. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for
calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various classes of shares and the proper allocation
of expenses among the classes of shares and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial
report referred to in Condition 9 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert,
on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing report referred to in that condition. Applicants will take immediate
corrective action if the Expert, or appropriate substitute Expert, does not so concur in the ongoing reports.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The prospectuses of each class of a Portfolio will include a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other
person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing shares may receive different compensation with
respect to one particular class of shares over another in the Portfolio.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted, and the duties and responsibilities of the directors
with respect to the Multi-Class System will be set forth in guidelines to be furnished to the directors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. A Portfolio will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services,
fees, and exchange privileges (if any) applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether
all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. Any shareholder report to a class of shares which contains
expense and performance data will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes
of shares of that Portfolio. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and
statement of operations, information related to the Portfolio as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each
Portfolio's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such
Portfolio. To the extent that any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable
to any class of shares of a Portfolio, it also will disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable
to all classes of shares of a Portfolio. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or
similar listing of a Portfolio's net asset value or public offering price will present each class of shares separately.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the requested exemptive order does not imply SEC approval, authorization
of, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that a Portfolio may make to Organizations pursuant to any
Plan in reliance on the exemptive order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Applicants will comply with proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, (Investment Company Act Release No. 16619
(November 2, 1988)), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.

<DOCTITLE>Issuer Delisting; Application To Withdraw From Listing and Registration; (Material Sciences Corporation, Common

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 -->
January 21, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Material Sciences Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(``Commission''), pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d)
promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on October 15,
1993 and concurrently therewith such stock was suspended from trading on the Amex. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant in maintaining the dual listing of its common stock on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market for the common stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before February 11, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made
in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection
of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application
after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

 This notice announces receipt by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of a petition for a determination

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
must be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
G&amp;K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;90&hyph;007) has
petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1991 Mercedes-Benz 500SEL (Model ID 126.037) passenger cars are eligible
for importation into the United States. The vehicle which G&amp;K believes is substantially similar is the 1991 Mercedes-Benz
420SEL, which was manufactured for importation into, and sale in the United States, and certified by its manufacturer,
Daimler Benz A.G., as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner contends that it carefully compared the 1991 model 500SEL to the 1991 model 420SEL, and found the two
vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G&amp;K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the 1991 model 500SEL, as originally
manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as the 1991 model 420SEL,
or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the 1991 model 500SEL is identical to the 1991 model 420SEL with respect
to compliance with Standard Nos. 102

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
G&amp;K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (``G&amp;K'') (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;90&hyph;007)
has petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1989 Peugeot 405 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United
States. The vehicle which G&amp;K believes is substantially similar is the 1989 Peugeot 405 that PSA Peugeot Citroen/USTR
manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, and certified as conforming to all applicable Federal
motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that it carefully compared the non-U.S.-certified 1989 Peugeot 405 to its U.S.-certified
counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G&amp;K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S.-certified 1989 Peugeot
405, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its
U.S.-certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1989 Peugeot 405 is identical to the U.S-certified
1989 Peugeot 405 with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102

Background

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act), 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(A)(i),
a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards
shall be refused admission into the United States on and after January 31, 1990, unless NHTSA has determined that the
motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale
in the United States, certified under section 114 of the Act, and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle
to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered
with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the
close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether
the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
G&amp;K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (``G&amp;K'') (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;90&hyph;007)
has petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300CE (Model ID 124.051) passenger cars are eligible
for importation into the United States. The vehicle which G&amp;K believes is substantially similar is the 1990 Mercedes-Benz
300CE that Daimler Benz A.G. manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, and certified as conforming
to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner states that it carefully compared the non-U.S.-certified 300CE to its U.S.-certified counterpart,
and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G&amp;K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S.-certified 300CE, as
originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S.-certified
counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S.-certified 1990 model 300CE is identical to the U.S.-certified
1990 model 300CE with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102

J.K. Motors, Inc. of Kingsville, Maryland (``J.K.'') (Registered Importer No. R&hyph;90&hyph;006) has petitioned
NHTSA to determine whether 1970 Ferrari 365 GT 2+2 passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States.
The vehicle which J.K. believes is substantially similar is the 1970 Ferrari 365 GT 2+2 that was manufactured for importation
into and sale in the United States and certified by its manufacturer as conforming to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner stated that it carefully compared the non-U.S. certified version of the 1970 Ferrari 365 GT 2+2 to its
U.S. certified counterpart, and found that the two vehicles are substantially similar with respect to compliance
with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J.K. submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S. certified 1970 Ferrari 365
GT 2+2, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as
its U.S. certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S. certified 1970 Ferrari 365 GT 2+2 is identical to its U.S. certified
counterpart with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces the publication by NHTSA of a report concerning ``Door Opening and Occupant Ejection through
Rear Hatches, Tailgates, and Other Back Doors.'' This report analyzes the available data on door opening and occupant
ejection from hatchback cars, stationwagons, sport utility vehicles, and light vans_vehicles frequently equipped
with a rear hatch, tailgate, or other back door_that were involved in towaway crashes. This report was done as part
of the agency's effort to understand the mechanisms of injury in vehicle crashes. It updates a 1990 report on ``Hatchback,
Tailgate, and Back Door Opening in Crashes and Occupant Ejection through the Back Area,'' by adding four more years
of the agency's detailed data on door opening and occupant ejection. The agency seeks public review and comment on
this report.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While Mongolia's formal governmental institutions continue their transition to democracy, its private sector
is moving at a slower pace. Community action groups and arts councils are in a formative stage, with little understanding
of their potential roles and opportunities in a democratic society. Fund-raising and techniques advocating change
outside governmental channels are almost unknown. This project focuses on facilitating the development of new citizen
groups and associations, providing information to leaders who are eager to create these institutions and consortia.
The development of citizen action groups should respond to the needs and interests of the people of Mongolia. U.S.
support is designed to provide an array of information or models from which Mongolian citizen activists may wish to
choose. USIA encourages proposals that feature ``train and trainers'' models; the creation of indigenous training
centers; schemes to create professional networks or professional associations to disseminate information; and
other enduring aspects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projects may include: study tours in the U.S. for small groups; short-term, non-technical workshops conducted in
Mongolia; four- to ten-week internships in the U.S.; planning trips or consultations in Mongolia; and the development
of specialized training materials.

Programmatic Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, grant programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life. Proposals must
be for projects that enhance the growth of indigenous, non-governmental, professional, civic, philanthropic,
or issue-oriented institutions and citizen exchange organizations. They should serve as an important avenue for
community participation in problem solving, quality of life enhancement, and professional development.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All proposals should demonstrate:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In-depth, substantive knowledge of the relevant issues;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Established connections with partner institutions;

(3) The capacity to organize and conduct the program, including appropriate orientation activities for the participants;
detailed work plan for all phases of the project; tentative agendas for study tours, workshops, and internships;
letters of commitment from internship hosts; and selection procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIS post consultation by applicants, prior to submission of proposals, is recommended. Address inquiries to the
Public Affairs Officer, American Embassy (USIS) Ulaanbaatar, PSC 461, Box 300, FPO AP 96521&hyph;0002; telephone:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA will give priority to proposals from U.S. organizations that have partner organizations in Mongolia or neighboring
regions, which will assist logistically and will contribute to the realization of program goals and objectives and
will themselves be enhanced by the program. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate partner relationship by providing
copies of correspondence or other materials as appendices to proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The partner institutions are encouraged to provide cost-sharing or significant in-kind contributions such as local
housing, transportation, interpreting, translating and other local currency costs and to assist with the organization
of projects.

USIA encourages the development, where needed, of written, audio and video materials in the local language to enhance
the training programs. For example, if not already available, glossaries of specialized terms in community action
work or development of not-for-profit, citizen-based organizations might be developed.

Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals should limit their focus to citizen-based action groups. Proposals for programs that are broader in scope
will be eligible, but are less likely to receive USIA support. USIA encourages proposals that feature ``train the
trainers'' models; the creation of indigenous training centers; schemes to create professional networks or professional
associations to disseminate information; and other enduring aspects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All grant proposals must clearly describe the type of persons who will participate in the program as well as the process
by which participants will be selected. Programs in support of internships in the U.S. must include letters tentatively
committing host institutions to support the internships. In the selection of all foreign participants, USIA and
USIS posts retain the right to nominate participants and to accept or deny participants recommended by the program
institution.

Guidelines and Restrictions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USIA does not support proposals limited to conferences or seminars of only a few days length which are organized as
plenary sessions, major speakers, and panels with a passive audience. It will support conferences only insofar as
they are a minor part of a larger project in duration and scope which is receiving USIA funding from this competition.
Furthermore, grants are not given to support projects whose focus is limited to technical issues, or for research
projects, for publications intended for dissemination in the United States, for individual student exchanges,
for film festivals or exhibits. Nor does this Office provide scholarships or other support for long-term (i.e., a
semester or more) academic studies. Proposals that request support for the development of university curriculums
or for degree-based programs will not be eligible under this RFP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals to link university departments or to exchange faculty and/or students are funded by USIA's Office of Academic
Programs (E/A) under the University Affiliation Program and should not be submitted under this RFP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Competitions sponsored by other offices of USIA's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs are also announced
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $125,000. However, exchange organizations with less than four years
of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they may also include separate sub-budgets
for each program component, phase, location or activity. Competition for USIA funding support is keen. Please note:
All participants will be covered under the terms of a USIA-sponsored health insurance policy. The premium is paid
by USIA directly to the insurance company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The following project costs are eligible for consideration for funding:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs; ground transportation costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Per Diem. For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for program participants
or the published U.S. Federal per diem rates for individual American cities. For activities outside the U.S., the
published federal per diem rates must be used.

3. Interpreters: Interpreters for the U.S. program are provided by the U.S. State Department Language Services Division.
Typically, a pair of simultaneous interpreters is provided for every four visitors who need interpretation. USIA
grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations from their home country. Grant proposal budgets
should contain a flat $140/day per diem for each DOS interpreter, as well as home-program-home air transportation
of $400 per interpreter plus any U.S. travel expenses during the program. Salary expenses are covered centrally and
should not be part of an applicant's proposed budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Book and cultural allowance: Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus
a book allowance of $50. Escorts are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these
benefits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Consultants. May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Daily honoraria generally
do not exceed $250 per day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written agreement between
the prospective grantee and subcontractor should be included in the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Room rental, which generally should not exceed $250 per day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Materials development. Proposals may contain costs to purchase, develop, and translate materials for participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. One working meal per project. Per capita costs may not exceed $5&hyph;8 for a lunch and $14&hyph;20 for a dinner;
this includes room rental if applicable. The number of invited guests may not exceed participants by more than a factor
of two to one.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. A return travel allowance of $70 for each participant which is to be used for incidental expenditures incurred during
international travel.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Complies with the requirements of OMB circular No. 1&hyph;133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and
Other Nonprofit Institutions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Complies with the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position

cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The audit costs shall be identified separately for:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Preparation of basic financial statements, and other accounting services; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133, AICPA SOP 92&hyph;9,
and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Cost-sharing is encouraged. Cost-sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient
must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the
value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular A&hyph;110, Attachment E, ``Cost-sharing
and Matching'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient does not provide the minimum amount
of cost sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion
to the Recipient's contribution.

Objectives of the Thai Local Government Project
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The newly elected government of Thailand has committed itself to improving the process of government. One aspect
of this commitment is an effort to decentralize aspects of the political process. USIA is interested in proposals
for programs that will foster effective administration of local and regional governments. Programs might examine
and seek to improve relationships among local executive, legislative, and judicial elements, or they might address
the knowledge and skills necessary to administer one or more of these branches of local government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Program topics might include one or more of the following: judicial administration, budget development, financial
management, tax policies and mechanisms, election practices, management of municipal services, privatization
of government property, consumer protection, business regulation (as opposed to control), licensing, or environmental
protection. Programs might further the development of information and library systems relevant to local government,
improve committee and staff structures, research capability, legislation drafting capability, or structural
and procedural needs of local governments. Programs should be conducted mostly in local centers, preferably situated
outside the capital city. Projects should lay the groundwork for new and continuing links between American and Thai
professional organizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projects may include: Study tours in the U.S. for small groups; short-term non-technical workshops conducted in
Thailand; four- to ten-week internships in the U.S.; planning trips or consultations in Thailand; and the development
of specialized training materials.

Programmatic Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, grant programs must maintain a non-political character and should
be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All proposals should demonstrate:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In-depth, substantive knowledge of the relevant issues;

letters of commitment from internship hosts; and selection procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

USIS post consultation by applicants, prior to submission of proposals, is recommended. Address inquiries to Assistant
Cultural Affairs Officer, AmEmbassy (USIS) Bangkok, Box 48, APO AP 96546&hyph;0001, Telephone 66&hyph;2&hyph;286&hyph;0900;
Fax 66&hyph;2&hyph;287&hyph;2102.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USIA will give priority to proposals from U.S. organizations that have partner organizations in Thailand or Southeast
Asia, which will assist logistically and will contribute to the realization of program goals and objectives and will
themselves be enhanced by the program. Applicants are encouraged to demonstrate partner relationships by providing
copies of correspondence or other materials as appendices to proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The partner institutions are encouraged to provide cost-sharing or significant in-kind contributions such as local
housing, transportation, interpreting, translating and other local currency costs and to assist with the organization
of projects.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USIA encourages the development, where needed, of written, audio and video materials in the local language to enhance
the programs. For example, if not already available, glossaries of specialized terms in local government or public
administration might be developed.

Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals should limit their focus to local governance. Proposals for programs that are broader in scope will be eligible,
but are less likely to receive USIA support. USIA encourages proposals that feature ``train the trainers'' models;
the creation of indigenous training centers; schemes to create professional networks or professional associations
to disseminate information; and other enduring aspects.

Participant Selection
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All grant proposals must clearly describe the type of persons who will participate in the program as well as the process
by which participants will be selected. Programs in support of internships in the U.S. must include letters tentatively
committing host institutions to support the internships. In the selection of all foreign participants, USIA and
USIS posts retain the right to nominate participants and to accept or deny participants recommended by the program
institution.

Guidelines and Restrictions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
USIA does not support proposals limited to conferences or seminars of only a few days length which are organized as
plenary sessions, major speakers, and panels with a passive audience. It will support conferences only insofar as
they are a minor part of a larger project in duration and scope which is receiving USIA funding from this competition.
Furthermore, grants are not given to support projects whose focus is limited to technical issues, or for research
projects, for publications intended for dissemination in the United States, for individual student exchanges,
for film festivals or exhibits. Nor does this Office provide scholarships or other support for long-term (i.e., a
semester or more) academic studies. Proposals that request support for the development of university curriculums
or for degree-based programs will not be eligible under this RFP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals to link university departments or to exchange faculty and/or students are funded by USIA's Office of Academic
Programs (E/A) under the University Affiliation Program and should not be submitted under this RFP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Competitions sponsored by other offices of USIA's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs are also announced
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, and may have different guidelines or restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $125,000. However, exchange organizations with less than four years
of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they may also include separate sub-budgets
for each program component, phase, location or activity. Competition for USIA funding support is keen. Please note:
All participants will be covered under the terms of a USIA-sponsored health insurance policy. The premium is paid
by USIA directly to the insurance company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The following project costs are eligible for consideration for funding:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs; ground transportation costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Per Diem. For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat $140/day for program participants
or the published U.S. Federal per diem rates for individual American cities. For activities outside the U.S., the
published federal per diem rates must be used.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Interpreters: Interpreters for the U.S. program are provided by the U.S. State Department Language Services Division.
Typically, a pair of simultaneous interpreters is provided for every four visitors who need interpretation. USIA
grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations from their home country. Grant proposal budgets
should contain a flat $140/day per diem for each DOS interpreter, as well as home-program-home air transportation
of $400 per interpreter plus any U.S. travel expenses during the program. Salary expenses are covered centrally and
should not be part of an applicant's proposed budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Book and cultural allowance: Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus
a book allowance of $50. Escorts are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these
benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Consultants. May be used to provide specialized expertise or to make presentations. Daily honoraria generally
do not exceed $250 per day. Subcontracting organizations may also be used, in which case the written agreement between
the prospective grantee and subcontractor should be included in the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Room rental, which generally should not exceed $250 per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Materials development. Proposals may contain costs to purchase, develop, and translate materials for participants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. One working meal per project. Per capita costs may not exceed $5&hyph;8 for a lunch and $14&hyph;20 for a dinner;
this includes room rental if applicable. The number of invited guests may not exceed participants by more than a factor
of two to one. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. A return travel allowance of $70 for each participant which is to be used for incidental expenditures incurred during
international travel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Audit Requirements: The proposal shall include the cost of an audit that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular No. 1&hyph;133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and
Other Nonprofit Institutions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Complies with the requirements of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of
Position (SOP) No. 92&hyph;9; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect
cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The audit costs shall be identified separately for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Preparation of basic financial statements, and other accounting services; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A&hyph;133, AICPA SOP 92&hyph;9,
and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Cost-sharing is encouraged. Cost-sharing may be in the form of allowable direct or indirect costs. The Recipient
must maintain written records to support all allowable costs which are claimed as being its contribution to cost participation,
as well as costs to be paid by the Federal government. Such records are subject to audit. The basis for determining the
value of cash and in-kind contributions must be in accordance with OMB Circular No. A&hyph;110, Attachment E, ``Cost-sharing
and Matching'' and should be described in the proposal. In the event the Recipient does not provide the minimum amount
of cost sharing as stipulated in the Recipient's budget, the Agency's contribution will be reduced in proportion
to the Recipient's contribution.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982, Public Law 97&hyph;394 (96 Stat. 1966, 1976) extends the statute of limitations
governing pre-1966 Indian damage claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(28 U.S.C. 2415) which was due to expire on December 31, 1982. A claim subject to the statute of limitations is an Indian
claim for money damages which arose prior to July 18, 1966. Claims against the United States are not governed by this
law, only money damage claims against persons, corporations, states, or any other entities except the Federal Government.
Claims for title to land are also not governed by this statute of limitations. This notice is required by section 5(c)
of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982, lists of all potential Indian damage claims,
which had at any time been identified by or submitted to the Bureau of Indian Affairs under the Department of the Interior's
Statute of Limitations Program, were published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 48 FR 13698, on March 31, 1983, amended at 48 FR 15008, on April 6, 1983; and at 48 FR 51204, on November 7, 1983, amended
at 49 FR 518, on January 4, 1984. Excluded from these lists were claims which were erroneously identified as claims
and those which had no legal merit whatsoever. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When rejecting any claim or category of claims included on the published lists, the Secretary must send a report to
the appropriate tribe whose rights or the rights of whose members could be affected by the rejection. The report must
identify each separate claim being rejected, list the names of potential plaintiffs and defendants, if known or reasonably
ascertainable, and briefly set forth the reason or reasons for rejection. A written notice of rejection must be sent
to individual Indian claimants if their identities and addresses are known or reasonably ascertainable from Bureau
of Indian Affairs records. After a report has been forwarded to a tribe, the Secretary must publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 identifying the claims covered in the report. By the terms of the Indian Claims Limitation Act of 1982, any right of
action on any claim appearing on the following list of claims, which have been rejected and reported accordingly by
the Secretary, shall be barred unless a complaint is filed in accordance with date established in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

The overall objective of this research program is to enhance the knowledge base necessary for the continued growth
of the domestic aquaculture industry as a form of sustainable agriculture. Emphasis is placed on research leading
to improved production efficiency, increased competitiveness and wise environmental stewardship in private sector
aquaculture in the United States. Because of limited funds for this program, only proposals focused on the interception,
removal, and/or disposal of waste in commercially important finfish production systems will be considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Research should be directed towards studies aimed at a systems approach to (1) reduce the impact of waste within aquacultural
production systems and/or (2) the interception, removal, and disposal of waste from aquacultural production systems.
Studies should target the development or the refinement of cost effective waste management systems. Innovative
approaches to reduction and removal of both dissolved and solid waste should be considered. The quantitative and
qualitative characteristics of waste, as a result of feed formulation and feeding strategies, should be considered
in the rational design of control systems and alternative waste management strategies. Mass balance approaches
to understanding the fate of phosphorus and nitrogen in these systems should also be addressed.

Priority will be given to multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional team approaches and proposals with broad application
to the aquaculture industry.

Compliance With NEPA
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As outlined in 7 CFR part 3407 (the CSRS regulations implementing NEPA), environmental data or documentation for
any proposed project is to be provided to CSRS in order to assist CSRS in carrying out its responsibilities under NEPA.
In some cases, however, the preparation of environmental data or documentation may not be required. Certain categories
of actions are excluded from the requirements of NEPA. The applicant should review the following categorical exclusions
and determine if the proposed project may fall within one or more of the exclusions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Department of Agriculture Categorical Exclusions (7 CFR 1b.3)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Policy development, planning and implementation which relate to routine activities such as personnel, organizational
changes, or similar administrative functions;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Activities which deal solely with the funding of programs, such as program budget proposals, disbursements,
and transfer or reprogramming of funds;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Inventories, research activities, and studies, such as resource inventories and routine data collection
when such actions are clearly limited in context and intensity;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Educational and information programs and activities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) Civil and criminal law enforcement and investigative activities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Activities which are advisory and consultative to other agencies and public and private entities; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) Activities related to trade representation and market development activities abroad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) CSRS Categorical Exclusions (7 CFR 3407.6)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on previous experience, the following categories of CSRS actions are excluded because they have been found
to have limited scope and intensity and to have no significant individual or cumulative impacts on the quality of the
human environment:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The following categories of research programs or projects of limited size and magnitude or with only short-term
effects on the environment:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Research conducted within any laboratory, greenhouse, or other contained facility where research practices
and safeguards prevent environmental impacts;

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(B) Surveys, inventories, and similar studies that have limited context and minimal intensity in terms of changes
in the environment; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Testing outside of the laboratory, such as in small isolated field plots, which involves the routine use of familiar
chemicals or biological materials.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Routine renovation, rehabilitation, or revitalization of physical facilities, including the acquisition
and installation of equipment, where such activity is limited in scope and intensity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for CSRS to make a determination regarding NEPA, as to whether any further action is required (e.g., preparation
of an environmental assessment (EA) or environmental impact statement (EIS)), pertinent information regarding
the environmental aspects of the proposed project is necessary; therefore, a separate statement must be included
in the proposal indicating whether the applicant is of the opinion that the project may fall within one or more of the
categorical exclusions listed above. This statement must include the reasons, with appropriate supporting documentation,
as to why the proposed project falls within a particular exclusion or exclusions. If the proposed project falls within
one or more of the categorical exclusions, the specific exclusion(s) must be identified. The information submitted
in association with NEPA compliance should be identified in the Table of Contents as ``NEPA Considerations'' and
the narrative statement with supporting documentation shall be placed at the back of the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though a project may fall within the categorical exclusions, CSRS may determine that an EA or an EIS is necessary
for a proposed project should substantial controversy on environmental grounds exist or if other extraordinary
conditions or circumstances are present that may cause a project to have a significant environmental effect.

Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals are invited for competitive grant awards under the Biotechnology Risk Assessment Research Grants Program
(the ``Program'') for fiscal year 1994. The authority for the Program is contained in section 1668 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;624
(the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, 7 U.S.C. 5921). The Program is administered by the Cooperative
State Research Service (CSRS) and the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the Program is to assist Federal regulatory agencies in making science-based decisions about the safety
of introducing genetically modified plants, animals, and microorganisms into the environment. The Program accomplishes
this purpose by providing scientific information derived from the risk assessment research conducted under it.
Research proposals submitted to the Program must be applicable to the purpose of the Program to be considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals based upon field research and whole organism-population level studies are strongly encouraged. Awards
will not be made for clinical trials, commercial product development, product marketing strategies, or other research
not appropriate to risk assessment. Proposals should be applicable to current regulatory issues surrounding the
ecological impacts of genetically modified organisms, with special emphasis on natural ecosystem consequences.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicant Eligibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Available Funding
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The approximate amount available for support of the program in fiscal year 1994 is $1,700,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to Section 719 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;111 (the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration,
and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994), funds available in fiscal year 1994 to pay indirect costs on research
grants awarded competitively by CSRS may not exceed 14 per centum of the total Federal funds provided under each award.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, pursuant to sec. 727(b) of Pub. L. 103&hyph;111, in the case of any equipment or product that may be authorized
to be purchased with the funds provided under this Program, entities are encouraged to use such funds to purchase only
American-made equipment or products.

Program Description
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Program, USDA will competitively award research grants to support science-based biotechnology regulation
and thus help address concerns about the effects of introducing genetically modified organisms into the environment
and to help regulators develop policies concerning such introduction. Proposals are invited in the area of biotechnology
risk assessment research as appropriate to agricultural plants, animals and microbes. Emphasis will be given to
risk assessment research involving genetically modified organisms, but model systems using nongenetically modified
organisms also will be considered if they can provide information that could lead to improved assessment of potential
risks associated with the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposals will be evaluated by a peer panel of scientists for, among other things, science quality; relevance for
current regulatory issues; and intent to advance the safe application of biotechnology to agriculture by providing
new knowledge for science-based regulatory decisions. The development of better methods for field testing genetically
modified organisms will also be considered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposals addressing the following research topics are requested:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Development of new risk assessment methods (e.g. monitoring organism escape, measuring biological impacts),
and risk assessment procedures (e.g. comparative analysis of ecosystems, models to predict risks) that could be
used in risk assessment of genetically modified fungi, bacteria, viruses (including animal vaccines), plants,
arthropods, fish, birds, and mammals. Applicants should address the development of such new risk assessment methods
in the course of addressing a specific and defined risk assessment issue, especially as pertains to genetically modified
organisms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Creation of information systems and computer models to support regulatory agency decision-making in regards
to potential impacts to the environment over time (e.g., computer models to describe the interaction of environmental
and organismal factors especially for establishment and dispersal of the organism).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Risk assessment of the environmental fate (e.g. survival, reproduction fitness, genetic stability, horizontal
gene transfer) as correlated with effects (i.e., loss of genetic diversity, enhanced competition) of genetically
modified fungi, bacteria, viruses, plants, arthropods, fish, birds and mammals introduced into the environment
(e.g., not in a contained laboratory greenhouse or building); and studies or identification of traits which may influence
fate and effects.

In response to requests to Program Directors and Federal regulatory agencies, as stipulated in the authorizing legislation
for the Program, section 1668 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;624, the following specific areas of risk assessment research have
been identified as priorities for this year:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The bidirectional rates, mechanisms and impact of gene transfer between currently genetically transformable
crop species and existing North American wild relatives of those crops including studies of methods of mitigation
of potential gene exchange. Species specifically identified by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service include
rye, oats, barley, sorghum and turfgrasses. Research could rely on reanalysis of published information and/or laboratory/filed
studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The potential for recombination between plant viruses and plant-encoded nocapsid viral genes (e.g. replicase),
especially for those viruses in supergroup B (carmovirus, tombusvirus, luteovirus, sobemovirus). Such studies
should identify recombination potentials and, if demonstrated, define frequencies and effect on symptom expression.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The potential for plants to express nonviral genes using noncoding regulatory sequences (promoters, translational
enhancers, termination sequences) derived from plant viruses that naturally infect the plants (e.g. cauliflower
mosaic virus and Brassica supp.). The potential for changes in expression of introduced genes or other aspects of
host physiology when the transgenic plant becomes infected with plant viruses, especially those from which the noncoding
sequence was derived or related viruses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Changes in viral host ranges or the types of insects which can serve as viral vectors due to the use of transgenic plants
expressing viral genes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The potential for nontarget effects of plant-defense compounds expressed in genetically modified plant-associated
microorganisms (e.g., compounds in phyllosphere or rhizosphere-inhabiting bacteria) or in plants (e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 -->
Bacillus thuringiensis 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
delta endotoxin), especially in regard to persistence of the organisms and material in the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Identification of the minimal gene sequence(s) in an animal pathogen which could confer pathogencity on a nonpathogenic
organism. Pathogenic organisms specially identified by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service as being
of interest are Marek's disease virus, laryngo tracheitis virus, bovine leukemia virus, eastern equine encephalomyelitis
virus, bovine diarrhea virus, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae and Haemophilus somnus.

Individual investigators whose research projects are funded under the Program will be required to attend and present
data on results of their research at an Annual Conference. Attendance costs at such a conference do not need to be included
in the budgets of proposed research projects; such costs will be borne from funds previously awarded under the Program
as part of a conference grant. Additionally, a final project report on research results will be required in a fixed
protocol, electronic format, suitable for distribution by USDA on CD&hyph;ROM.

(2) CSRS and ARS Categorical Exclusions (7 CFR 3407.6 and 7 CFR 520.5)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on previous experience, the following categories of CSRS and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ARS actions are excluded because they have been found to have limited scope and intensity and to have no significant
individual or cumulative impacts on the quality of the human environment:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The following categories of research programs or projects of limited size and magnitude or with only short-term
effects on the environment: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Research conducted within any laboratory, greenhouse, or other contained facility where research practices
and safeguards prevent environmental impacts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Surveys, inventories, and similar studies that have limited context and minimal intensity in terms of changes
in the environment; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Testing outside of the laboratory, such as in small isolated field plots, which involves the routine use of familiar
chemicals or biological materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Routine renovation, rehabilitation, or revitalization of physical facilities, including the acquisition
and installation of equipment, where such activity is limited in scope and intensity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for CSRS and ARS to determine whether any further action is needed with respect to NEPA, pertinent information
regarding the possible environmental impacts of a particular project is necessary; therefore, a separate statement
must be included in the proposal indicating whether the applicant is of the opinion that the project falls within a
categorical exclusion and the reasons therefor. If it is the applicant's opinion that the project proposed falls
within the categorical exclusions, the specific exclusions must be identified. The information submitted shall
be identified as ``NEPA Considerations'' and the narrative statement shall be placed after the coversheet of the
proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though a project may fall within the categorical exclusions, CSRS and ARS may determine that an Environmental
Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement is necessary for an activity, if substantial controversy on environmental
grounds exist or if other extraordinary conditions or circumstances are present which may cause such activity to
have a significant environmental effect.
