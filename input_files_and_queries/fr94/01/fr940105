SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule amends the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) regulations by providing that an
application for labor certification filed with a state employment office before October 1, 1991, must be filed with
the Service in connection with a petition filed under section 203(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act)
before October 1, 1993, in order to maintain a pre-October 1, 1991 priority date. This rule implements section 302(e)(2)
of the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA), which amended section
161(c)(1) of the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT). This rule is necessary to ensure full public awareness of the October
1, 1993 deadline.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 29, 1991, the Service published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 56 FR 60897&hyph;60913, revising 8 CFR 204.5(d), which provides that the priority date for an employment-based
petition that is accompanied by a labor certification shall be the date the request for labor certification was accepted
for processing by any office within the employment service system of the Department of Labor. A priority date cannot
be established unless the Service approves a petition under section 203(b) of the Act based on a labor certification
approved by the Department of Labor. Subsequent to the promulgation of this regulation, the President signed into
law the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991, (MTINA) Public Law 102&hyph;232,
dated December 12, 1991. Section 302(e)(2) of the MTINA, which amended section 161(c)(1) of the Immigration Act of
1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 102&hyph;649, dated November 29, 1990, was enacted in order to address the transition of
labor certifications filed before October 1, 1991 into the new employment-based immigrant visa categories created
by IMMACT. Section 302(e)(2) of MTINA provides that, in order to maintain the priority date of a labor certification
filed in connection with an employment-based petition which was submitted to a state employment office before October
1, 1991, the employer must file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act before October 1, 1993. Section 302(e)(2)
of MTINA further provides that if the Department of Labor approves a pre-October 1, 1991 labor certification application
subsequent to October 1, 1993, the employer must file a petition under section 203(b) of the Act within 60 days of the
date of certification. Although not specifically provided for in section 302(e)(2) of MTINA, the Service has interpreted
that section to require that, in the case of labor certifications which have been certified by the Department of Labor
between August 2, 1993 and October 1, 1993, a petition under section 203(b) must be filed within 60 days after the date
of certification to preserve the earlier priority date. This reading of section 302(e)(2) of MTINA furthers congressional
intent by allowing at least 60 days from the date of certification to file the petition under section 203(b) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of the above, 8 CFR 204.5(d) will be amended to reflect these MTINA amendments. The regulation will be further
amended to provide that if the petitioner fails to maintain the priority date by filing a timely petition, the new priority
date shall be the date a new petition is properly filed with the Service.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service's implementation of this rule as an interim rule, with provision for post-promulgation public comment,
is based on the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3). The reasons and necessity for immediate
implementation of this interim rule are as follows: Immediate promulgation of this interim rule is necessary to insure
full public awareness of the October 1, 1993 deadline mandated by MTINA. Specifically, petitioning employers who
submitted labor certification applications with a state employment office before October 1, 1991 and who have not
submitted a petition with the Service under section 203(b) of the Act, must be made clearly aware that the provisions
of 8 CFR 204.5(d), regarding assignment of priority dates, have been superseded by the MTINA amendments. Moreover,
immediate promulgation of these regulations will inform the petitioning employer that, in cases where the request
for labor certification was filed with a state employment office before October 1, 1991, it should file a petition
under section 203(b) of the Act with the Service as soon as possible after the Department of Labor has issued the labor
certification in order to obtain an earlier priority date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that
this rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is anticipated
that this rule affects only a very limited number of petitioners and aliens who filed requests for labor certifications
prior to October 1, 1991, but have not yet filed petitions under section 203(b) of the Act. This rule is not significant
within the meaning of section 3(f) of E.O. 12866, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations governing fitness-for-duty (FFD) programs
that are applicable to licensees who are authorized to construct or operate nuclear power reactors and to licensees
authorized to possess, use, or transport formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material (SSNM). The amendment
permits licensees to reduce the random testing rate for all persons covered by the fitness-for-duty regulations
to an annual rate equal to 50 percent.

The NRC has reviewed experiences gained since publication of the current FFD rule on June 7, 1989 (54 FR 24468), and
implementation by power reactor licensees on January 3, 1990, and determined that it may be appropriate to modify
the random testing rate. Accordingly, on March 24, 1993 (58 FR 15810), the Commission published a proposed modification
to the FFD rule that would permit a reduction in the random testing rate for licensee employees, but maintain the 100-percent
random testing rate for contractors and vendors.

Summary of Public Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment period expired on June 22, 1993. Forty comment letters were received. Twenty-eight were from power reactor
licensees, six from unions, one from an industry association, one from a vendor, three from licensed reactor operators,
and one from a private citizen. There was overwhelming support for the proposed reduction in the annual rate of random
testing for licensee employees. Most of the commenters believed that the reduced rate also should apply to contractors
and vendors, and several commenters proposed a flexible, performance-based rate. There was no support for excluding
from any reduction in the random testing rate certain positions critical to the safe operation of a nuclear power plant,
such as licensed reactor operators. A summary of the comments received and the NRC's responses are presented below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Comment. The random testing rate for licensee employees should be reduced to 50 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All of the 23 commenters submitting comments on the Commission's proposed reduction of the random testing rate to
50 percent for licensee employees supported the proposal. The reason most often expressed was the low rate of positive
random test results experienced by licensee employees, particularly in comparison with other industries having
significant safety concerns. These commenters believe that this low industry-wide positive rate justifies the
lowering of the random testing rate to 50 percent. Some commenters stated that a 50-percent rate for licensee employees
would make that rate consistent with the random testing rate currently required in the substance abuse programs mandated
for entities regulated by the agencies within the Department of Transportation (DOT), including the Federal Aviation
Administration and the Federal Highway Administration. They also noted that DOT is currently considering lowering
its proposed random testing rate below 50 percent even though Federal Highway Administration data, for example,
indicate a significantly higher positive rate than that experienced among NRC licensee employees. Another commenter
pointed out that the lowered random testing rate for licensee employees subject to the NRC's FFD rule also would be
consistent with the random rate applied in the Commission's own internal drug testing program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters supported the reduction with the expectation of significant cost savings for licensees as a result
of only testing approximately one-half the number of employees now being tested. In this regard, the Nuclear Management
and Resources Council (NUMARC) made reference to the November 1992 GAO report, ``Employee Drug Testing: Opportunities
Exist To Lower Drug-Testing Program Costs'' (GAO/GGD&hyph;93&hyph;13), which suggests reduced random testing
rates as a means of producing cost efficiencies in Federally mandated drug testing programs without adversely affecting
program integrity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concerning the relative effectiveness of alternative random testing rates, some commenters believe that a 50-percent
random testing rate would produce satisfactory deterrence of drug and alcohol abuse. This is particularly true in
light of the fact that other FFD program elements, such as program awareness training and behavioral observation,
and the access authorization program will continue to inhibit such behavior. Two commenters also supported the proposed
change because it would lessen the disruption of workers lives and reduce the invasion of privacy that random drug
testing creates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
NRC Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC concurs with those commenters who stated that a 50-percent random testing rate as applied to licensee employees
can be expected to provide sufficient deterrence to justify lowering the rate at this time. It also agrees with the
observation that the access authorization program and other FFD program elements, such as policy communications
and awareness training, behavioral observation, for-cause testing, employee assistance programs, and the imposition
of strict sanctions for violations of an FFD policy will continue to deter drug and alcohol abuse by most of the workforce.
As some commenters noted, requiring fewer tests of licensee employees should decrease the privacy invasion experienced
by some employees. It also should result in cost savings across the industry by reducing lost work hours and the number
of tests to be administered.

The Commission recognizes that positive results in the nuclear power industry's random testing are generally among
the lowest of any U.S. industry. Nonetheless, it realizes that there are many variables that can affect the rate of
positive testing results and that relatively low positive test results, by themselves, are not the only indicator
of the effectiveness of a testing program either on an industry-wide or a licensee program level. Some of the variables
that could affect the testing results are the propensity of the population being tested to use drugs and alcohol, the
effectiveness of other program elements, and the extent to which tested employees have been successful in subverting
the testing process and avoiding detection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC does not have sufficient information about these or other factors that may influence testing results to be
able to determine that the decreasing positive rates reported by licensees are an unqualified indication of FFD program
effectiveness. Nonetheless, the Commission is gratified to observe the decreasing positive rates in licensee employees'
random test results during the past three years. The recently published NUREG/CR&hyph;5758, Volume 3, ``Fitness
for Duty in the Nuclear Power Industry: Annual Summary of Program Performance Reports,'' indicates that licensee
employees' positive random testing rate in 1992 was 0.20 percent as compared to 0.28 percent in 1990 and 0.22 percent
in 1991. There also have been decreasing positive rates for random testing of contractor and vendor personnel, viz.,
0.56 percent in 1990, 0.55 percent in 1991, and 0.45 percent in 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making its decision, the Commission has considered these testing results along with the apparent continuing strength
of the other elements of most licensees' FFD programs, the reduced invasion of employees' privacy interests, and
the potential for cost savings. In light of this industry experience and of these beneficial effects, the Commission
has concluded that it is reasonable at this time to lower the random testing rate for licensee employees and contractor
and vendor personnel to 50 percent. The response to Comment 4 discusses the Commission's reasons for allowing reduction
in the random testing rate for contractor and vendor personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Comment. The random testing rate should be reduced to less than 50 percent.

Four commenters recommended that the random testing rate be reduced to less than 50 percent. The rates they recommended
varied from 5 percent to 25 percent. Their central argument was that the random testing rate can be lowered substantially
without threatening the effectiveness of the program. The very low rates of drug and alcohol positive tests that have
been recorded by the nuclear industry during the first two years of FFD program operations are the basis for their recommendation.
One licensee stated that most chronic drug users probably have been eliminated and currently there is not a serious
drug or alcohol abuse problem in the industry. This commenter and NUMARC also cited the GAO study that found that the
percentage of positives does not vary significantly among Federal agency drug testing programs, regardless of what
random rate is used. Another licensee emphasized that behavioral observation, not random testing, is the most potent
tool in detecting drug abuse. Another commenter recommended that the NRC consider further reductions because the
effectiveness of other program elements makes a random rate of even 50 percent unnecessarily high.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Significant cost savings was given as the most compelling reason to reduce the random rate below 50 percent. One licensee
estimated the industry would save up to $30 million annually without degradation of the overall program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in the response to Comment 1 above, positive random testing results are not, by themselves, the only indicator
of the FFD program's effectiveness in detecting substance abuse. The NRC does not have sufficient information about
the many variables that could affect testing results to be able to determine that a lower random testing rate would
maintain an acceptable level of program effectiveness. Therefore, the Commission believes that the industry's
relatively low numbers of drug and alcohol positive random test results should not be used as the sole justification
for lowering the random testing rate below 50 percent. While behavorial observation and for-cause testing are valuable
program elements, there still must be a strong random testing program that provides an adequate level of detection
and deterrence. The Commission continues to believe that it must choose a conservative and prudent random testing
rate that maximizes both detection and deterrence of substance abuse while minimizing the monetary and social costs
of such testing. The Commission believes that a 50-percent random testing rate will strike the proper balance between
the dictates of public health and safety, the financial needs of licensees, and the privacy and other interests of
workers subject to the testing requirement. Given the substantial unknowns currently associated with the true detection
and deterrence effectiveness of alternative random testing rates as applied to the particular conditions of the
nuclear power industry workforce, the Commission believes that it cannot establish a random testing rate lower than
50 percent for any segment of the industry at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should also be noted that relatively low positive test rates do not necessarily indicate that there is not a drug
and alcohol abuse problem, as some commenters asserted. First, some users have become adept at avoiding detection,
and the use of increasingly effective subversion techniques may be one reason why random testing results are decreasing.
Second, while it may be that most of the chronic drug users who were in the industry when the program started have been
detected or have left, there can be expected to be a continuing level of intermittent illegal drug use and alcohol abuse
among industry employees; such use is difficult to detect. The Commission concludes that the low positive random
test results do not indicate that there has ceased to be a drug and alcohol abuse problem and that further reduction
in the random testing rate would not be appropriate at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the commenters' reference to the GAO's observation that the percentage of positives does not vary significantly
among Federal agency drug testing programs, the NRC notes that the GAO's objective in that report was to identify potential
cost savings in Federal employee drug testing programs. Its objective did not include determination of the relative
deterrent values of alternative random testing rates. In accomplishing its objective, the GAO properly concentrated
on only the costs associated with Federal employee drug testing. It did not perform an indepth analysis of the several
variables that influence testing results nor of the very complex relationship between those variables and the deterrence
value of testing. Such variables would include the inclination for drug or alcohol abuse among the employees in the
various industries in which the Federal testing programs operate, the extent to which the strength and effectiveness
of other, non-testing program elements, such as drug awareness training, may affect testing results, and the relative
stringency of sanctions imposed by the various Federal agencies following positive test results. Because the GAO's
objective was to address the cost rather than the deterrence effectiveness of testing, the NRC does not consider the
commenter's reference to the GAO's observation to be a persuasive argument for reduced random testing rates.

The NRC will continue to monitor implementation of the rule and will modify the rule in response to industry experience,
advances in technology, or other considerations to ensure that the rule is achieving the general performance objectives
set forth in 10 CFR Part 26.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Comment. The random testing rate should be flexible and based on performance, such as the positive rate of random
testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twelve commenters recommended that the Commission allow some form of performance-based approach to determine the
random testing rate. Under such a system, the random testing rate would vary over time. This would depend on each licensee's
or, alternatively, the industry's positive random test results from a previous period. One licensee, for example,
suggested that each licensee's random testing rate should be based upon that particular licensee's previous 12-month
testing results. Under this approach, a licensee would be subject to a minimum 50-percent random testing rate if it
experienced a positive rate of greater than 0.50 percent during the previous 12 months. That licensee could reduce
its random rate to 25 percent if it subsequently had a 12-month positive rate between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent
or to as low as 10 percent if its positive rate for the previous year was less than 0.25 percent. Three other licensees
recommended similar schemes whereby a licensee's random rate would be determined by its own record of positive test
results. One of these recommendations based the rate on the results of the previous 2 years rather than those of the
previous 12 months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUMARC proposed that the industry-wide random testing rate be determined by the industry-wide random testing results
from the previous period. This recommendation was endorsed by five licensees. Under NUMARC's proposed approach,
the industry would be allowed by regulation to adjust its random testing rate based on testing results from the previous
reporting period. All licensees would be required to test at a 100-percent random rate if the industry-wide positive
rate were greater than 1.0 percent in the previous period, at a 50-percent random rate if the positive rate was between
0.50 percent and 1.0 percent, at a 25-percent random rate if the positive rate was between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent,
and at a 10-percent random rate if the positive rate was less than 0.25 percent. Two of the eleven licensees favoring
a performance-based testing system provided a general recommendation that did not specify whether the random testing
rate should be based on the positive testing results of each individual licensee, or on the results of the industry
as a whole.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters noted various potential advantages of adopting a performance-based approach to setting the random
testing rate. One stated that adopting such an approach would be consistent with the NRC's initiative to identify
performance-based programs that would be beneficial to the industry. Another listed cost savings, equity in that
each licensee's random rate would be commensurate with its program performance, and an incentive for licensees to
maximize program conformance with the FFD rule as advantages of such an approach.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During development of 10 CFR part 26 in 1989, the Commission considered a variation of the flexible, performance-based
random rate similar to the approaches recommended by these commenters. (See, for example, the NRC's response to Comment
7.4.2 in NUREG&hyph;1354, ``Fitness for Duty in the Nuclear Power Industry: Responses to Public Comments.'') At
that time, the Commission decided against adopting a performance-based rate for various reasons. As stated above,
positive random testing results are not the only indicator of detection and deterrence effectiveness or of overall
random testing program performance to allow the testing rate to vary with testing results. Adopting a performance-based
approach would tend to discourage the initiatives that the Commission is encouraging in 10 CFR 26.24(b) and in Section
2.1 of Appendix A to Part 26. In &sect;26.24(b), the NRC allows licensees to implement programs with more stringent
standards, for example, lower screening and confirmation cutoff levels and a broader panel of drugs than those specified
in the rule. In Section 2.1 of Appendix A, licensees are permitted to test for any illegal drugs during a for-cause test
or analysis of specimens suspected of being adulterated or diluted. Program performance data for the first three
years of FFD program implementation have shown that those licensees using screening cutoff levels for marijuana
that are lower than the maximum allowed 100 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) have had a higher percentage of confirmed
positive results than those screening at 100 ng/ml. (See NUREG/CR&hyph;5758, Vols. 1&hyph;3.) Licensees that employ
special measures to detect attempts to dilute specimens or flush metabolites from the body report that their positive
rate is about doubled. This result is similar to data presented to the Department of Health and Human Services' Drug
Testing Advisory Board on June 10, 1993, and reported in ``The National Report on Substance Abuse'' on June 18, 1993.
(The study is currently undergoing peer review before publication.) Adopting a performance-based approach that
allowed licensees to reduce their random testing rates as positive testing results declined would likely discourage
licensees from adopting lower screening cutoff levels and taking measures to detect attempts by users to avoid detection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, a performance-based approach would require the collection and analysis of performance data to provide the
bases for adjustments to the random testing rate. Such data is not currently collected by the licensees or the NRC.
Previous efforts known to the NRC staff to identify and analyze the many candidate performance indicators for measuring
the effectiveness of random testing have been inconclusive, primarily because of the numerous variables. Furthermore,
assuming that the proper performance indicators can be developed, it would appear that the collection and analysis
of data to support a performance-based approach would add a considerable administrative burden to both licensees
and the NRC.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all these reasons and until further experience is gained that would support a performance-based approach, the
Commission declines to adopt such an approach to setting the random testing rate.

4. Comment. The reduction in the random testing rate should be applied to all workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four of the 30 commenters on this issue_three unions and one licensee_supported the Commission's proposal that licensees
maintain the 100-percent random testing rate for contractor and vendor employees. Their reasons included a concern
for lack of commitment by contractor employees to maintaining the industry's high drug-free standard and the need
for the higher testing rate to provide continued deterrence for contractor employees. One of the three unions recommended
that long-term contractors should have the same lower random testing rate as that of licensee employees because test
results of long-term contractors and licensee employees have been almost identical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were several issues consistently mentioned by those 26 commenters who opposed maintaining the 100-percent
random testing rate for contractor and vendor employees. There was a general concern for unnecessary inconsistencies
in random testing rates between Federal agencies. Commenters recommended that the NRC program be kept as consistent
as possible with programs in other Federally regulated safety-related industries. These include the DOT programs
that currently require contractors and vendors to be randomly tested at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50-percent rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various licensees cited the testing results from 1990 and 1991 which, in their opinion, create no statistically sound
rationale for testing contractor and vendor employees at a rate different from that of licensee employees. They argued
that, while the contractor/vendor positive testing rate has been twice that of licensee employees, it is still low
enough to make unnecessary the expenditure of the resources necessary to maintain two separate random testing pools.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various commenters noted that contractors and vendors are subject to the identical access authorization and other
FFD program requirements as are licensee employees, including behavioral observation. These stringent requirements,
in their view, obviate the need to keep the contractor/vendor random rate at 100 percent. Some also noted that the deterrent
value of random testing is in the act of testing itself and not in what many consider to be a high rate of testing. Some
commenters warned that keeping contractors and vendors at 100 percent could be construed as discriminatory against
those employees and may be perceived as punitive rather than as a corrective measure. Two licensees also cited a study
of the detection effectiveness of nine random testing rates published in NUREG/CR&hyph;5784, ``Fitness for Duty
in the Nuclear Power Industry: A Review of the First Year of Program Performance and an Update of the Technical Issues,''
which indicates that a 100-percent testing rate is only a little more effective than a 50-percent rate for detecting
occasional drug users.

Although there is a difference between the positive results of random testing of licensee employees and those of contractor
and vendor employees, the positive random testing rate of both groups has been less in each year since 1990, as stated
in the response to Comment 1 above. While the contractor/vendor random testing positive rates continue to be about
twice the rate for licensee employees and statistical analysis of the data shows that the difference in proportion
between the contractors' and licensees' employees is not explained within statistical fluctuations (therefore,
differences in the rates are statistically significant), the Commission agrees that the absolute numbers of positive
test results of all categories of nuclear power workers are low. Therefore, the Commission will permit its licensees
to lower the random testing rate to 50 percent for all persons covered by 10 CFR part 26. However, the Commission will
continue to monitor licensee program performance and effectiveness and will make program adjustments as necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the comments regarding the study of the detection effectiveness of nine random testing rates published
in NUREG/CR&hyph;5784, the Commission notes that the study explicitly dealt with only the hypothetical detection
effectiveness of those alternatives. It did not address their relative deterrence effectiveness. While it may be
that the effectiveness of a 100-percent random testing rate for deterring occasional drug users could be slightly
higher than that of a 50-percent rate, the Commission nonetheless believes that a 50-percent random testing rate
will provide sufficient deterrence to drug and alcohol abuse by contractor and vendor employees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to commenters' concerns about unnecessary inconsistencies in random testing rates between Federal
agencies, the Commission continues to believe that the random test rate for employees in the nuclear power industry
need not be similar to the rates applied to employees in all, or even most, other Federal agencies or Federally mandated
programs. Not all Federal agencies have identical safety concerns or responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Comment. There should be no difference in the random testing rate for certain positions critical to the safe operation
of a nuclear power plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventeen commenters responded to the Commission's question as to whether certain positions critical to the safe
operation of a nuclear power plant, such as licensed reactor operators, should be excluded from any reduction of the
random testing rate. All these commenters recommended against such differentiation. Two licensees stated that
treating people in positions critical to safety differently from other employees could have a negative effect on
the morale, self-image, and motivation of this group of highly trained and dedicated specialists. Another stated
that all plant employees are critical to safe operation. Therefore, a reduction in the random testing rate should
apply to all employees. The potential for added record-keeping requirements creating unnecessary burdens for the
industry was another reason for not making this distinction. In the opinion of one commenter, the 1990&hyph;1992
industry-wide program performance data do not support testing people in positions critical to safety at a different
rate than that applied to other licensee employees. Finally, one licensee cited potential problems getting union
agreement to testing this classification of employees at a higher rate than other licensee personnel subject to the
FFD rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The essence and unanimity of these comments_that licensed operators and other employees in positions critical to
the safe operation of a nuclear power plant should not be excluded from a reduction of the random testing rate_is not
surprising. These particular members of the nuclear power industry's workforce have collectively demonstrated
their dedication to safe and efficient plant operations. As at least one commenter noted, the industry's program
performance data for the first three years of operation do not support differentiating between people in safety-critical
positions and other licensee employees insofar as the random testing rate is concerned. The 1992 program performance
data, for example, show that eighteen of the industry's approximately 5,000 licensed operators tested positive
for drugs or alcohol or otherwise violated the licensee's FFD policy; twelve of these were a result of random testing.
When comparing these results to the 461 positive results out of 156,730 random tests administered to the industry
workforce, the difference in proportion between the licensed operators and the industry workforce is within statistical
fluctuations and the difference in the positive rates is not statistically significant. While the NRC expects licensees
to continue to take action to drive this number of positives down even further, this record does not merit testing people
in these positions at a rate different from that applied to other licensee employees. The Commission, therefore,
concurs with the commenters' recommendation that certain positions critical to the safe operation of a nuclear power
plant, such as licensed reactor operators, should not be excluded from a reduction of the random testing rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Comment. Random testing is expensive and produces false positives. Furthermore, chronic users are able to avoid
detection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters, a power plant worker and a union, argued against the usefulness of continued random testing. One of
these commenters stated that random testing produces false positives. These cost the industry large amounts of money
in settlements and damage the public's perception of licensees' fairness. As additional support for this position,
this commenter warned that chronic drug abusers are particularly adept at escaping detection from random testing
by subverting the testing process. The other commenter recommended that random testing be eliminated because it
is not effective in identifying workers who are impaired at the time urine samples are collected. For-cause testing,
in this commenter's opinion, is more effective because it more accurately reflects a worker's present ability to
perform his/her job at the time he/she is tested. This commenter also stated that random testing appears to be a means
of having the NRC enforce the Controlled Substances Act which is not the NRC's responsibility.

The Commission has long been well aware of the types of FFD program-related concerns as addressed by these commenters.
During the promulgation of 10 CFR part 26 in 1989, the Commission fully addressed these and many other such concerns.
(See NUREG&hyph;1354, ``Fitness for Duty in the Nuclear Power Industry: Responses to Public Comments.'') At that
time the NRC concluded, for example, that licensee FFD programs should be concerned not only with impairment, but
also with worker reliability and trustworthiness. The NRC believes that any illegal drug use or alcohol abuse by a
worker reflects upon his or her trustworthiness and reliability. Likewise, random testing is not intended, nor has
it ever functioned, as a means to enforce the Controlled Substances Act. Section 26.29(b) provides that licensees,
contractors, and vendors shall not disclose test results to law enforcement officials unless those officials request
such information under court order. It also is noted that there is no requirement to routinely provide such officials
with testing results. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is well aware that there is a potential for false positive results and, therefore, has required numerous
quality control measures and safeguards to prevent such occurrences. In Appendix D to NUREG/CR&hyph;5758, Volume
3, the testing process errors that were reported by licensees during the first three years under the FFD rule were analyzed.
Of over 800,000 specimens tested, there were two false positives of personnel specimens reported by the laboratories,
both due to administrative errors. In both cases, the quality assurance programs detected and corrected the problem.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the NRC's particular concern with the degree to which the testing process can be subverted, the Commission
staff has continued to track the ways in which workers have subverted testing processes in industries across the country.
These efforts have resulted in staff recommendations for amending 10 CFR part 26 to introduce various means for combatting
subversion. Lastly, the Commission believes that the added protection of public health and safety that the FFD program
provides is well worth the industry's costs of administering this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Comment. Maintaining two separate populations of workers for random testing is an unnecessary and expensive burden.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of the commenters stated that requiring two random testing rates would force licensees to develop two separate
testing programs. The resulting additional administrative and financial burdens would cancel out any savings resulting
from reducing the licensee employee rate to 50 percent. NUMARC stated that the industry would save approximately
$4.1 million if the number of tests of contractor and vendor employees was cut in half.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some of the comments noted above asserted that separate random testing rates for licensee employees and contractors/vendors
would create additional administrative and financial burdens for licensees. Although this issue is somewhat moot
since the Commission will permit licensees to reduce the random testing rate to 50 percent per year for all persons
covered by Part 26, the Commission does not concur that conducting random testing using two random rates would have
caused appreciably higher administrative or operating costs. Presumably, most licensees' data bases already distinguish
between licensee employees and contractor/vendor employees subject to testing. Numerous commenters on the initial
rule in 1989 indicated that the workforce population should be separated so that permanent employees would not be
tested at a much higher rate to make up for contractors who might not be on site when selected for testing (see comment/response
7.4.3 of NUREG&hyph;1354). The NRC staff understands that several licensees have divided their testing population
as permitted by the rule. The number and identity of licensee employees in the testing pool remains rather constant
over time. The number and identity of contractor/vendor employees in the testing pool, on the other hand, varies quite
considerably over time depending on outages and other operational considerations. A licensee may choose to create
more than one test population so that it may test portions of its workforce at a greater rate or reduce the burden on its
employees from being tested at a higher rate to compensate for the testing of contractors and vendors not normally
on site.

In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule affects only the licensing
and operation of nuclear power plants and activities associated with the possession or transportation of Category
I material. The companies that own these plants do not fall within the scope of the definition of ``small entities''
set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act or the Small Business Size Standards issued by the Small Business Administration
in 13 CFR part 121.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule represents a relaxation from current part 26 requirements for drug testing since the rule permits (but does
not require) licensees to reduce the random testing rate for all persons covered by the rule. Accordingly, the rule
does not represent a backfit as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1), and a backfit analysis is not required for this rule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 an amendment adopting Airworthiness Directive (AD) T93&hyph;24&hyph;51 that was sent previously to all known U.S.
owners and operators of all Airbus Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes by individual telegrams. This AD
requires repetitive operational tests of feel and limitation computers (FLC) 1 and 2. This amendment is prompted
by a report that the pitch control on a Model A300&hyph;600 series airplane operated with stiffness. The actions specified
by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD are intended to prevent stiff operation of the pitch control and undetected loss of rudder travel limitation function.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 1, 1993, the FAA issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
telegraphic airworthiness directive (AD) T93&hyph;24&hyph;51, which is applicable to all Airbus Model A310 and
A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. That action was prompted by a report from an operator that the pitch control on a Model
A300&hyph;600 series airplane operated with stiffness. Investigation into the cause of this stiffness revealed
that the feel and limitation computer (FLC) failed and caused stiff operation of the pitch control. This condition,
if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not corrected, could result in stiff operation of the pitch control and undetected loss of rudder travel limitation
function, which may adversely affect controllability of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Airbus Industrie has installed these computers on all Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. Each airplane
has two FLC's, designated FLC 1 and FLC 2. The FLC and the pitch feel fault lights are integral components of the pitch
feel system. (The pitch feel fault lights indicate a failure of the FLC.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, these airplanes are allowed to operate with one inoperative pitch feel system. If the airplane is operated
with one inoperative pitch feel system, failure of the other FLC could result in stiff operation of the pitch control
and undetected loss of rudder travel limitation function. This failure could also allow excessive elevator movement,
which could expose the airplane structure to excessive air loads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus Industrie has issued All Operator Telex (AOT) 27&hyph;14, dated November 2, 1993, applicable to all Airbus
Model A310 and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes, that describes procedures for performing repetitive operational
tests to verify proper operation of FLC's 1 and 2. The Direction &Gacute;e&nacute;erale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC),
which is the airworthiness authority for France, classified this AOT as mandatory and issued French telegraphic
airworthiness directive 93&hyph;202&hyph;153(b), dated November 2, 1993, in order to assure the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.
Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described
above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action
is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered
in the United States, the FAA issued Telegraphic AD T93&hyph;24&hyph;51 to require repetitive operational tests
to verify proper operation of FLC's 1 and 2. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the AOT previously
described. Any FLC that fails the operational test is required to be repaired or replaced in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with a method approved by the FAA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AD also prohibits operation of any airplane with an inoperative pitch feel system or inoperative pitch feel fault
lights.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since it was found that immediate corrective action was required, notice and opportunity for prior public comment
thereon were impracticable and contrary to the public interest, and good cause existed to make the AD effective immediately
by individual telegrams issued on December 1, 1993, to all known U.S. owners and operators of all Airbus Model A310
and A300&hyph;600 series airplanes. These conditions still exist, and the AD is hereby published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 as an amendment to &sect;39.13 of part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) to make it effective as to all persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer has advised that it currently is developing a modification
that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this modification is developed, approved,
and available, the FAA may consider additional rulemaking.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
``ADDRESSES.'' 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in
the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;NM&hyph;208&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has
been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
(44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant
under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the
Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to certain Allied Signal Aerospace Company,
Air Transport Avionics (Allied Signal) Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) II processors that are
installed on aircraft. This action requires replacing the existing TCAS II processor with a new processor that incorporates
updated computer logic. The development of candidate enhancements to TCAS II logic that improves its utility and
increases its overall operational acceptance prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by this AD are
intended to prevent collisions or near misses caused by incompatibility between the TCAS II processors and the current
air traffic control system.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that applies to certain Allied Signal
TCAS II processors that are installed on aircraft was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 9, 1993 (58 FR 47405). The action proposed to require (1) removing from service all processors that do
not have computer logic ``Change 6.04A'' incorporated; and (2) mandatory incorporation of ``Change 6.04A'' into
the TCAS II computer system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Interested persons have been afforded an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opportunity to participate in the making of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amendment. Due consideration has been given to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received from 33 different owners, operators, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, and organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All commenters express their concern of the FAA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance date of December 30, 1993, especially since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allied Signal's service bulletin will not be available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until early 1994. The following summarizes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance times that the commenters recommended: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;18 recommended one year or less; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;5 recommended longer than one year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;10 recommended an extension without a proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Air Traffic Controllers Association and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Airline Pilots Association both recommend an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``aggressive implementation'' of ``Change 6.04A''. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has re-evaluated the December 30, 1993, compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time and has determined that the compliance time should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be changed to December 31, 1994. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Change 6.04A'' has been upgraded to ``Change 6.04A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced'', which eliminates unnecessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-crossing resolution advisories (RA's) included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Change 6.04A''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allied Signal has assured the FAA that (1) the upgrade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ``Change 6.04A Enhanced'' is minor and will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated in the logic change for the TCAS II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor upgrades; and (2) this compliance time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correlates with their schedule for disseminating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service information and kits necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the incorporation of ``Change 6.04A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced''. The proposed AD has been changed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect the compliance time change and logic change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, Allied Signal states that ``Change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.04'', which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA-certified and is currently in service, accomplishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the major intent of ``Change 6.04A Enhanced'' and should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be considered as an acceptable interim version to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the eventual upgrade to ``Change 6.04A Enhanced''. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA recognizes that ``Change 6.04'' incorporates several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the features of ``Change 6.04A Enhanced''. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA has determined that (1) ``Change 6.04'' does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an equivalent level of safety to that of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Change 6.04A Enhanced''; and (2) ``Change 6.04A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced'' should be incorporated as a way to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collisions or near misses caused by incompatibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the TCAS II processors and the current air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
traffic control system. Compliance time extension 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration will be given on a case-by-case basis to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airlines or operators experiencing compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficulties that arise because of fleet size. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD remains unchanged as a result of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allied Signal also lists several additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aircraft that these TCAS II processor units are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified for installation. The FAA has incorporated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these into the proposed AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, who supports the implementation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Change 6.04A Enhanced'', requests that the FAA issue a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplementary notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propose installing this revised software by June 30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995. This commenter states that significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences exist between ``Change 6.04A'' and ``Change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.04A Enhanced''. The FAA does not concur. Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received in response to the proposed AD reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unanimous support for implementing ``Change 6.04A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced''. The FAA considers the logic change (which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduces non-crossing RA's) to be minor. The intent is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to correct the unsafe condition by installing modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCAS II computer units that incorporate updated logic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that the requirement to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement Version 6.04A software, including the latest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enhancement, will (1) correct the unsafe condition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) maintain the same intent originally proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without altering the substance of the proposed rule; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) impose no additional burden on the public than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was previously proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, issuing a supplemental NPRM would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessitate (under the provisions of the Administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment period, considering any additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments received, and eventually issuing a final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The time required for these procedures could take as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
long as four additional months. In light of this, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in consideration of the amount of time that has already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elapsed since issuance of the original NPRM, the FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concludes that soliciting further public comment is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary and that further delay of the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action is not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters request that the FAA revise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact specified in the proposed AD to reflect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs associated with the development, testing prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification, and certification of the modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor. These costs would be absorbed by suppliers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installers, and airline operators. The FAA does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concur that the economic impact statement include this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. The 1 workhour necessary to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed action was provided to the FAA by the TCAS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
II processor manufacturer based on the best data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to date. This number represents the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to install the revised software. The cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis in AD rulemaking actions typically does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include costs associated with development, testing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prior to certification, and certification of a modified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor. The proposed action remains unchanged as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result of these comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of all available information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the comments noted above, the FAA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that air safety and the public interest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change in compliance time, the logic reference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change, the incorporation of known aircraft that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCAS II processor units are installed on, and minor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these changes and corrections will not change the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public than was already proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 3,000 TCAS II processors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it will take approximately 1 workhour per processor to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the required action, and that the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these figures, the total cost impact of this AD on U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators is estimated to be $165,000. These figures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are based on the assumption that none of the operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the airplanes equipped with the affected TCAS II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors have accomplished the actions specified in

The regulations adopted herein will not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the national government and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, or on the distribution of power and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities among the various levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to all Honeywell Traffic Alert and Collision
Avoidance System II (TCAS II) computer units installed on various transport category airplanes, that requires replacing
certain TCAS II computer units with new units that incorporate updated collision avoidance system (CAS) logic, and
modifying the computer surveillance logic. This amendment is prompted by the development of candidate enhancements
to TCAS II logic that will improve its utility and increase its overall operational acceptance. The actions specified
by this AD are intended to prevent collisions or near misses caused by incompatibility between the TCAS II processors
and the current air traffic control system.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is
applicable to all Honeywell Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II) computer units installed on
various transport category airplanes was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 9, 1993 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(58 FR 47407). That action proposed to require replacing certain TCAS II computer units with new units that incorporate
updated collision avoidance system (CAS) logic, and modifying the computer surveillance logic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issuance of the notice, an additional change to Version 6.04A collision avoidance system (CAS) logic was
recommended at a meeting held to discuss the progress made in implementing logic modification 6.04A. Meeting attendees
included representatives from the FAA and European civil aviation authorities, U.S. and European aviation industry,
and U.S. operators. The logic change that was recommended involves reducing unnecessary crossing resolution advisories
(RA). That change is included in a new enhanced software package (identified as Version 6.04A), specified in Mitre
letter F046&hyph;L&hyph;0069, dated September 21, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsequently, Honeywell Inc. has issued Service Bulletin 4066010&hyph;34&hyph;SW16, dated December 20, 1993.
The service bulletin describes procedures for converting certain TCAS II computer units to new units (Version 6.04A).
The new units incorporate all of the logic changes specified in the preamble to the notice, including updating CAS
logic, modifying the computer surveillance logic to ensure that these units accommodate Mode C altitude input of
100-foot increments, and ensuring that the system will be tracked and coordinated by intruding aircraft when the
Mode S transponder CA field is set at CA=7. The conversion is onboard-loadable, or it may be accomplished at a field
repair shop. The first method involves data loading the TCAS II computer unit in the aircraft equipment bay using an
ARINC 615 or 603 data loader. The second method entails performing a final test, and then programming the TCAS II computer
unit to convert it to the latest enhanced version at a field repair shop.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice proposed that operators accomplish the modification requirements of this AD in accordance with a method
approved by the FAA. However, the FAA has reviewed and approved the Honeywell service bulletin discussed previously,
and has determined that accomplishment of this service bulletin is an appropriate method of compliance. Consequently,
the FAA has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule to cite the Honeywell service bulletin as the appropriate source
of service information, and has removed the language referring to accomplishing the actions ``in accordance with
a method approved by the FAA.'' Even though this language has been deleted from paragraph (a), operators may still
be permitted to accomplish the actions in accordance with an FAA-approved method under the provisions of paragraph
(c) of the final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of this new data and software developement, the FAA has revised the final rule by changing the reference to
Mitre letter F046&hyph;L&hyph;0056, dated July 20, 1993, which appeared in paragraph (a)(1) of the NPRM, to Mitre
letter F046&hyph;L&hyph;0069, dated September 21, 1993, since the latter identifies the enhanced software package.
Since the original Version 6.04A software was never issued, no operator could have installed that version. Therefore,
no redundant actions would be required on the part of any operator as a result of this change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the enhanced Version 6.04A software introduces a change in the operation of the aircraft, the FAA also finds
that a revision to the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) is necessary as a conforming change to correspond with that new
software configuration. The AFM revision is advisory only, and will ensure that the flight crew is aware of the changes
associated with the new software installation. Consequently, paragraph (b) has been added to the final rule to reflect
this informational AFM revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received in response to the notice:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, Honeywell, objects to the proposed compliance date of December 30, 1993, and states that December
31, 1994, represents a more realistic compliance timeframe. Honeywell indicates that operators vary in their ability
to load the updated software due to maintenance and aircraft schedules and data-load/test resources. Honeywell
states that, although it has been working aggressively to implement the latest change, that change has resulted in
a delay in the date operators will be able to implement the latest change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several other commenters also request that the FAA extend the proposed compliance date from 3 to 18 months after the
date specified in the proposal in order to accommodate implementation, verification, certification, and incorporation
of the proposed software change into existing installations. One commenter, the Air Transport Association (ATA)
of America, supports implementation of the latest enhanced Version 6.04A, and requests that the FAA issue a supplemental
notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to propose that this revised software be retrofitted by June 30, 1995. ATA contends
that significant differences exist between Version 6.04A and the latest enhanced version. Another commenter requests
that the FAA solicit comments from foreign agencies participating in TCAS evaluation and simulations to help ensure
that the proposed Version 6.04A revision will be compatible and acceptable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs partially with these requests to extend the compliance time. The FAA has considered the safety implications,
the time necessary for approval of the enhanced Version 6.04A software, the size of the fleet, and normal maintenance
schedules for timely accomplishment of implementation of the modification. In light of these considerations, the
FAA has determined that a compliance date of December 31, 1994, is appropriate. Paragraph (a) of the final rule has
been revised to specify the revised compliance date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, in response to the requests that a supplemental NPRM be issued and that further public comments be solicited,
the FAA submits the following. Comments received in response to the proposal reflect unanimous support for implementation
of the latest enhanced Version 6.04A software. The FAA considers the logic change (reduction of unnecessary crossing
RA's) incorporated in the enhanced software to be a minor change. The intent of this AD is to require that the addressed
unsafe condition be corrected by installing modified TCAS II computer units that incorporate updated CAS logic.
The FAA has determined that a requirement to implement Version 6.04A software, including the latest enhancement,
will meet that intent, will not alter the substance of the rule, and will impose no additional burden on any member of
the public. Additionally, issuance of a supplemental NPRM would necessitate (under the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the period for public comment, considering additional comments
received, and eventually issuing a final rule; the time required for that procedure may be as long as four additional
months. In light of this, and in consideration of the amount of time that has already elapsed since issuance of the original
NPRM, the FAA concludes that solicitation of further public comment is not necessary and that further delay of this
final rule action is not appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter requests that the FAA require Honeywell TCAS II processors that are already installed be operated in
the ``traffic advisory (TA) only'' mode until the updated software package is installed. The commenter indicates
that ``possible hidden problems'' could exist between the different versions of logic that are installed currently
in the TCAS II processors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. Operation of currently installed TCAS II processors in the ``TA
only'' mode would impair the capability of those processors to alert the flight crew of appropriate aircraft maneuvers
that must be taken to prevent mid-air collisions. Further, the FAA is unaware of any ``possible hidden problems''
between the different versions of logic installed currently in the TCAS II processors, as suggested by the commenter.
Therefore, the FAA concludes that currently installed TCAS II processors should not be operated in the ``TA only''
mode until the updated software packaged is installed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests clarification of the unsafe condition specified in the proposed rule. This commenter points
out differences in the wording of the unsafe condition between this proposed rule and two existing proposals that
address the same CAS logic change for Rockwell International/Collins Air Transport Division (Collins), and Allied
Signal Aerospace Company/Air Transport Avionics (Allied Signal), TCAS II processors. From this comment, the FAA
infers that the commenter requests that the proposed statement of unsafe condition more closely parallels the statement
of unsafe condition in the other two proposals addressing the same subject.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs. The FAA has revised the unsafe condition specified in this final rule to coincide with the proposals
that address Collins and Allied Signal TCAS II processors to more explicitly reference safety considerations, as
follows: ``*&blank;*&blank;* to prevent collisions or near misses caused by incompatibility between the TCAS II
processors and the current air traffic control system.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, Falcon Jet Corporation, indicates that Honeywell TCAS II processors are installed on Mystere-Falcon
Model 50 and 900 series airplanes, and requests that these airplanes be included in the portion of the applicability
of the AD that lists airplanes on which this TCAS II processor may be installed. The FAA concurs with the commenter's
request and has revised the final rule accordingly. In addition, the FAA has become aware of other airplane models
affected by this AD and has included those models in that portion of the applicability statement of the final rule.
The FAA clarifies that, as stated in the preamble and the applicability of the proposal, the affected Honeywell TCAS
II processors are installed on various transport category airplanes and are not limited only to those airplanes listed
in the applicability of this AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters request that the FAA revise the economic impact information specified in the proposal to reflect
costs borne by suppliers, installers, and airline operators associated with development, testing, and certification
of the modified processor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur with the commenters' request to revise the economic impact information contained in this AD.
The appropriate number of hours required to accomplish the required actions, specified as 3 in the economic impact
information, below, was provided to the FAA by the processor manufacturer based on the best data available to date.
This number represents the time required to gain access, remove the existing processor, install a diskette containing
the revised software, and close up. The cost analysis in AD rulemaking actions typically does not include costs associated
with development, testing, and certification of a modified processor, as suggested by the commenter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 2,700 transport category airplanes in the worldwide fleet on which the Honeywell TCAS II
computer units may be installed. The FAA estimates that 1,150 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD,
that it will take approximately 3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on
these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $189,750, or $165 per airplane. This
total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the requirements of this AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

International, Collins Air Transport Division 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Collins), Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(TCAS) II processors that are installed on aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action requires replacing the existing TCAS II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor with a new processor that incorporates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
updated computer logic or reprogramming certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processors while they are still on board the aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The development of candidate enhancements to TCAS II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
logic that improves its utility and increases its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall operational acceptance prompted the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action. The actions specified by this AD are intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to prevent collisions or near misses caused by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incompatibility between the TCAS II processors and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received from 31 different owners, operators, manufacturers, and organizations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All commenters express their concern of the FAA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance date of December 30, 1993. The following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summarizes the compliance times that the commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;21 recommended one year or less; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;3 recommended longer than one year; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;7 recommended an extension without a proposed time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Air Traffic Controllers Association and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Airline Pilots Association both recommend an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``aggressive implementation'' of ``Change 6.04A''. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA has re-evaluated the December 30, 1993, compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time and has determined that the compliance time should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be changed to December 31, 1994. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Change 6.04A'' has been upgraded to ``Change 6.04A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enhanced'', which eliminates unnecessary non-crossing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolution advisories (RA's) included in ``Change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.04A''. Collins has assured the FAA that (1) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upgrade to ``Change 6.04A Enhanced'' is minor and will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated in the logic change for the TCAS II 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processor upgrades; and (2) this compliance time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correlates with their schedule for disseminating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service information and kits necessary to accomplish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the incorporation of ``Change 6.04A Enhanced''. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD has been changed to reflect the compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time change and logic change described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter states that the affected aircraft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators should operate their TCAS II units in the ``TA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mode Only'' until the new logic is incorporated because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of possible hidden problems that could exist between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different logic versions currently installed. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not concur that these TCAS II units should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated in the ``TA Mode Only''. The information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided by an RA may prove to be useful to the pilot. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pilot has the option of whether to utilize the RA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter recommends referencing Collins Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bulletin (SB) No. 16, TTR&hyph;920&hyph;34&hyph;16, dated December 9, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993, as a way of complying with the proposed AD. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA concurs that this service information is a way of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complying with the proposed action, and has included a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
note in the final rule that so indicates this. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter proposes a change to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD that would allow reprogramming the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit on board the aircraft as a method of compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the proposed action. The FAA concurs that certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing TCAS II part numbers may be reprogrammed with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the unit on board the aircraft. The proposed AD has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been modified to include this method on the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TCAS II processor part numbers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter states that reference to the SAAB 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
340B airplanes in the General Aviation Airplanes list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be deleted. This commenter also recommends that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the Aerospatiale ATR&hyph;42 and ATR&hyph;72 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes be moved from the General Aviation Airplanes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list to the Air Transport Airplanes list. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurs and has revised the proposed AD accordingly.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, who supports the implementation of ``Change 6.04A Enhanced'', requests that the FAA issue a supplementary
notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to propose installing this revised software by June 30, 1995. This commenter
states that significant differences exist between ``Change 6.04A'' and ``Change 6.04A Enhanced''. The FAA does
not concur. Comments received in response to the proposed AD reflect unanimous support for implementing ``Change
6.04A Enhanced''. The FAA considers the logic change (which reduces non-crossing RA's) to be minor. The intent is
to correct the unsafe condition by installing modified TCAS II computer units that incorporate updated logic. The
FAA has determined that the requirement to implement Version 6.04A software, including the latest enhancement,
will (1) correct the unsafe condition; (2) maintain the same intent originally proposed without altering the substance
of the proposed rule; and (3) impose no additional burden on the public than was previously proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, issuing a supplemental NPRM would necessitate (under the provisions of the Administrative Procedures
Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the public comment period, considering any additional comments received,
and eventually issuing a final rule. The time required for these procedures could take as long as four additional months.
In light of this, and in consideration of the amount of time that has already elapsed since issuance of the original
NPRM, the FAA concludes that soliciting further public comment is not necessary and that further delay of the final
rule action is not appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters request that the FAA revise the economic impact specified in the proposed AD to reflect costs associated
with the development, testing prior to certification, and certification of the modified processor. These costs
would be absorbed by suppliers, installers, and airline operators. The FAA does not concur that the economic impact
statement include this information. The 5 workhours necessary to accomplish the proposed action was provided to
the FAA by the TCAS II processor manufacturer based on the best data available to date. This number represents the time
required to install the revised software and test for proper operation after installation. The cost analysis in AD
rulemaking actions typically does not include costs associated with development, testing prior to certification,
and certification of a modified processor. The proposed action remains unchanged as a result of these comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of all available information including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that
air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed except for the change in compliance
time, the logic reference change, the option of reprogramming certain units on board the aircraft, reference to Collins
SB No. 16, TTR&hyph;920&hyph;34&hyph;16, dated December 9, 1993, and minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined
that these changes and corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public
than was already proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 1,995 TCAS II processors in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately
5 workhours per processor (1 workhour for installation and 4 workhours for operational testing) to accomplish the
required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Based on these figures, the total cost
impact of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $548,625. These figures are based on the assumption that none
of the operators of the airplanes equipped with the affected TCAS II processors have accomplished the actions specified
in this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action
is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is issuing a final rule adopting regulations to standardize
the content of, and procedures for accessing, information relevant to the availability of service on interstate
pipelines. The Commission's standards will require pipelines to make this information available on Electronic
Bulletin Boards (EBBs) and through downloadable files and will detail procedures and protocols for EBB operation
and file transfers.

 the Commission created a new operating environment for interstate pipelines and shippers on those pipelines by requiring
pipelines to unbundle the sale of gas from the transportation of that gas and by introducing a mechanism permitting
shippers to trade unneeded capacity through Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBs) maintained by the pipelines. Because
shippers will now be transporting gas over multiple pipelines, the Commission concluded that the development of
uniform standards covering the content of, and methods for accessing, information relating to transportation would
improve the efficiency of gas movement across the interstate pipeline grid. To begin the process of developing the
needed standards, the Commission directed its staff to convene a series of informal conferences with all facets of
the gas industry to consider standards relating to capacity allocation. As a result of these conferences, the industry
reached consensus agreements on the information about available capacity that should be included on EBBs and the
procedures and protocols for making that information available.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is adopting a final rule reflecting the consensus agreements reached by the industry. The rule amends
the Commission's open access regulations by requiring pipelines to provide standardized information about the
availability of service on their systems. This information will be provided both on the pipelines' EBBs and through
files which users can download from the pipelines' computers to their own computers. The rule further requires pipelines
to provide this information according to standardized procedures and protocols, which will be maintained in a document
entitled ``Standardized Data Sets and Communication Protocols'' that can be obtained at the Commission. Pipelines
must implement the requirements of this rule by June 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also recognizes the standards and protocols it is adopting will need to be updated as more experience
with capacity release and the transportation environment under Order No. 636 is obtained. The Commission, therefore,
is proposing to continue the industry conferences to consider and propose modifications when needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Reporting Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission estimates the public burden for the information requirement under this final rule_including the
one-time start-up burden related to pipeline EBBs_will average 6,770 hours per company. The burden estimate includes
the time required to review and implement the standards, develop the necessary software, search existing data sources,
gather and maintain the data needed, create/validate common and proprietary codes/information and complete and
review the information. The information/data elements required to be maintained on pipeline EBBs will be under a
new information requirement, FERC&hyph;549(B), Gas Pipeline Rates: Capacity Release Information. The annual
burden associated with the new FERC&hyph;549(B) information requirement will be 528,060 hours based on the estimated
initial EBB development burden and daily EBB informational updates by an anticipated 78 pipeline respondents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Included in the annual burden estimate are 40,560 hours (520 hours per company) attributable to the creation of common/proprietary
codes to identify pipelines and common transaction points. The codification requirements were not part of the burden
estimates contained in the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) issued July 29, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the final rule contains new information and EBB requirements, many of which are one-time start-up activities,
it is anticipated that FERC&hyph;549(B) burden will be reduced by 2,250 hours per respondent (for a total reduction
of 175,500 hours for all respondents) the year following the implementation of the EBB systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arkla Energy Resources Company and Mississippi River Transmission Corporation state that providing comments on
the burden estimate in the NOPR is difficult until final resolution of EBB issues. Interstate Natural Gas Association
of American states the burden estimate in the NOPR is reasonable for the items included in the proposed rule, but would
be too low if additional items, such as common codes are included. No party has submitted contrary data on a revised
burden estimate for the requirements proposed in the NOPR. The only significant change from the NOPR is the requirement
to create a common code data base and the Commission has revised its estimate to include the additional burden of this
effort. Accordingly, the Commission finds its burden estimates reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons may send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of this information requirement,
including suggestions for reductions of the burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol
Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415,
FAX (202) 208&hyph;2425]; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,
Washington, DC 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission].

III. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Order No. 636, the Commission required pipelines to establish EBBs to provide shippers with equal and timely access
to relevant information about the availability of service on their systems, including service available through
capacity release transactions and firm and interruptible capacity available directly from the pipeline.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission recognized the efficiency of capacity allocation would be enhanced by standardizing both the content
of capacity release information and the methods by which shippers could access that information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On February 26, 1993, the Commission held a technical conference to examine the industry's efforts in standardizing
information content and communication procedures. The participants at the conference expressed a willingness
to establish a broad industry-wide working group to reach consensus on standards governing capacity release transactions.
The Commission subsequently established informal conferences with Commission staff and all interested members
of the gas industry to facilitate the development of consensus standards.

A broad spectrum of firms and organizations participated in these Working Groups, including representatives from
the major segments of the gas industry and other interested parties, such as computer and software firms. The participants
at the conferences divided their efforts into five working groups covering different areas of standardization and,
on July 1 and July 6, 1993, the Working Groups submitted reports on their deliberations. Working Groups 1 and 2 reached
consensus on proposed standardized data sets setting forth the information concerning available capacity. Working
Group 4 agreed on a set of communication protocols governing the dissemination of the information. Working Group
5 proposed methods for developing codes to identify companies and common transaction points, but had not finalized
standards in these areas. Working Group 3 reported on its progress in considering standards relating to business
practices other than capacity release, but did not propose any standards. The Working Group reports included minority
positions on several items. The Commission also provided an additional period for the public to comment on the Working
Group proposals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 29, 1993, the Commission issued a Notice Of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) proposing to adopt standards reflecting
the consensus agreements reached by the industry working groups.

IV. Summary of the Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule adopts the regulation and standards as proposed in the NOPR, with only slight modifications. The final
rule adopts &sect;284.8(b)(5) requiring pipelines to provide standardized information relevant to the availability
of service on their systems. Under the rule, pipelines must provide the standardized information on their EBBs and
provide users with the ability to download the standardized information in compliance with standardized procedures
and protocols. The rule provides that the details of the required information, procedures, and protocols will be
made available in a document entitled ``Standardized Data Sets and Communication Protocols,'' which would be available
from the Commission's Public Reference and Files Maintenance Branch.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the standardized information includes information relevant to the availability of interruptible transportation,
the rule also revises &sect;284.9(b)(4), which governs interruptible transportation, to cross-reference the
standardization requirements in &sect;284.8(b)(5).

 This information includes offers to sell firm capacity (either by the pipeline or releasing shippers), bids for capacity,
awards of capacity, withdrawals of capacity offers and bids, operationally available (i.e., interruptible) capacity,
and system-wide notices. The protocols establish principles and procedures relating to the operation of pipeline
EBBs and the provision of downloadable files to users. Under these protocols, pipelines will provide for file downloads
in two formats: one that complies with standards for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) promulgated by the American
National Standards Institute (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 and a second format that does not comply
with ASC X12, but which provides files in standard flat ASCII format.

On-line EBB refers to a continuous computer connection between a pipeline EBB and a user's computer in which the information
from the pipeline's computer is displayed visually on the user's computer and the user can enter data directly to the
pipeline's computer. File downloading refers to the transfer in computerized format of a file from the pipeline's
computer to the user's computer. The user can use its own internal computer programs to manipulate the data.

A. Need for a Flexible Mechanism To Make Revisions to the Standards and Protocols 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission proposed to proceed through rulemaking, rather than a policy statement, finding that
the benefits of standardization can be achieved only when all pipelines provide the same information through the
same procedures. The Commission concluded a rulemaking was the proper approach to issuing mandatory requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters support the Commission's issuance of a rule to ensure full compliance, but urge the Commission
to commit itself to a process for revising the requirements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 They maintain that once the industry obtains experience with capacity release, revisions may be needed. Natural
supports the use of notice and comment rulemaking, but it requests clarification that, even though the referenced
document of standards and protocols is not contained in the Code of Federal Regulations, any modifications to these
standards or protocols will be made through rulemaking procedures. It maintains changes to this document could result
in significant administrative burdens and costs and, therefore, contends the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
requires that such changes be made only through a notice and comment rulemaking. O&amp;R and Williston urge the Commission
to proceed using a policy statement to ensure the utmost flexibility for modifications.

The Commission adheres to its determination to proceed through rulemaking to ensure the uniformity standardization
requires. Nevertheless, the Commission agrees with the commenters that revisions and modifications to the standards
and protocols will need to be made on a regular basis as the industry obtains more experience with capacity release
transactions and with the changed operating environment created by Order No. 636. For example, in the two months after
issuance of the NOPR, Working Groups 1 and 2 already have proposed revisions to the standardized data sets to ensure
that they function effectively and to clarify a number of items. The Commission proposes to continue the informal
conferences and the Working Groups as the best means for monitoring the performance of the standards and proposing
needed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the Commission's ability to respond to the need for changes, it adopted only a general regulation requiring
the pipelines to standardize their provision of capacity information, while the standards and protocols themselves
were to be provided in a separate document not contained in the Code of Federal Regulations. The Commission is committed
to making needed modifications and revisions to the standards and protocols as quickly as possible. Determining
the appropriate mechanism for making such changes is premature, because the method should vary depending on the type
of change contemplated; maintenance of the standards to correct problems or improve their functioning should be
handled differently than significant substantive changes in the means of providing the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making changes to the data sets and protocols, the Commission intends to follow the APA and provide notice and an
opportunity for comment, just as it has in the past with respect to proposed changes by the Working Groups. For example,
when Working Groups 1 and 2 submitted their recent set of revisions, the Commission noticed the filing and provided
an opportunity for written comments as well as for consideration of the revisions at one of the Commission's EBB conferences.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Commission is issuing the current data sets along with this rule, the Commission realizes that as pipelines
begin the process of correlating the downloadable data sets with the information provided by offerors and bidders
through their on-line EBBs, difficulties with the data sets may be identified. All pipelines immediately must begin
the correlation process, so they can report any significant difficulties to Working Groups 1 and 2. The Commission
is committed to implementing the data sets by June 1, 1994, and Working Groups 1 and 2, therefore, should ensure that
they provide the Commission with any additional changes they believe are essential in sufficient time to permit implementation
of the data sets, including ASC X12 downloadability, by that date. The Commission recognizes that the data sets may
not be perfect when implemented, but, as discussed above, the Commission is committed to a process for revising the
data sets on a regular basis after implementation.

Sabine maintains small pipelines may not be able to comply with the requirements outlined in the NOPR. It does not suggest
a blanket exemption for small pipelines, but instead recommends they be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate that
the costs of implementing the standards would outweigh the benefits of compliance.

The Commission recognizes small pipeline compliance with some of the requirements of the standards and protocols
may not be cost justified or essential to obtain the benefits the Commission sought to achieve through standardization.
The Commission cannot make a generic determination of the particular standards and protocols with which small pipelines
should not have to comply; compliance with some of the standards may not involve as much added cost as compliance with
others and partial compliance may still be of benefit to users.

C. Implementation Date
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission proposed an April 1, 1994 implementation date, finding this date would provide pipelines
with sufficient time to program their computers to incorporate the changes required and would permit final testing
of the system during the off-peak summer season. Many commenters support the April 1, 1994 implementation date, some
suggesting no extension be given.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Peoples Gas, et al., and UDC state this date should not result in delay in implementing the on-line EBBs already required
by Order No. 636. Some commenters contend the April 1, 1994 date is sufficient for the items included in the NOPR, but
would not give sufficient time for implementation of additional requirements resulting from the Working Groups'
February 1, 1994 reports on those items which the Commission set for further consideration.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Other commenters contend the April 1, 1994 date is too ambitious for all items and assert the Commission should not
set an interim date, but should require full implementation by the fall of 1994.

 AER/MRT contends an April 1, 1994 implementation date for the ASC X12 requirement, in particular, is unreasonably

The Commission will agree to delay the implementation date to June 1, 1994, to allow the Working Groups and the pipelines
to make final revisions that will improve the functioning of the EBBs and the downloadable data sets. But, given this
extension, the Commission expects the pipelines to have an operational set of standards fully implemented by June
1, 1994. At the same time, the June 1, 1994 date will permit capacity release transactions, which may be significant
in the off-peak season, to benefit from the standards. The June 1, 1994 date applies to the implementation of EDI, but
not to the implementation of common codes, as discussed later.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission clarifies that this date applies only to the items included in this rule, not to further items resulting
from the February 1, 1994 reports. The June 1, 1994 date also does not delay pipelines' compliance with the EBB requirements
of Order No. 636; pipelines must comply with these requirements by the date specified in their restructuring orders.

The June 1 date is not an interim date, but the final date for compliance with these requirements. The reference in the

to uncover lacunae in operation not detected during routine small scale (or beta) testing of the system.

later than the June 1, 1994 date.

Williston Basin asserts the February 1, 1994 date for the Working Group reports is premature since the industry will
not have sufficient experience with capacity release by then to make additional modifications. The Commission is
not persuaded to change the February 1 date for the Working Group reports. These reports are intended to cover the items
on which the parties did not have the time to reach consensus in time for their July reports, but which the Commission
found were susceptible to resolution given more time. As discussed earlier, the Commission is committed to updating
these standards when necessary in light of experience. The timing of additional meetings or reports to consider further
revisions are better made at a later point.

D. Modifications to the Regulatory Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NGSA and Process Gas Consumers Group suggest the rule should be revised to require each pipeline to submit a compliance
filing specifying in its tariff the details of how it will supply the services required by the rule. UDC suggests the
imposition of reporting requirements to permit the Commission and the public to monitor the initial operation of
EBBs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission perceives no need at this point for requiring compliance filings by pipelines or the submission of
periodic reports. The requirements of the rule are straight-forward. The communication protocols require pipelines
to provide users with scripts detailing the procedures for accessing (logging-on to) the pipelines' computer systems,
and providing further detail through tariff filings seems unnecessary. Monitoring of the system can be better accomplished
through Commission oversight of pipelines' compliance by accessing their EBBs and through the use of industry conferences
than through tariff filings or inflexible periodic reporting requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Process Gas Consumers Group suggests the deletion of the phrase ``on its Electronic Bulletin Board'' from the opening
clause of the rule. It contends this phrase suggests the rule may not cover EDI access to data, may not apply to pipelines
using third-party vendors to provide EBB services, and appears to require pipelines to provide information about
accessing their EBB solely through their EBB, thereby creating a Catch-22 in which shippers can obtain information
on how to access a pipeline's EBB only by knowing how to access the EBB.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will not delete the reference to Electronic Bulletin Boards because pipelines must provide the required
information on their EBBs as well as through downloadable files. The Commission, however, will modify the regulation
slightly to make even more explicit that both modes of communication must be provided. The Commission expects pipelines
to provide users with instructions for accessing their EBBs or using EDI transfers without having the user first access
the pipelines' EBB.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposed to set forth the information on capacity availability and the protocols governing the dissemination
of that information in a separate document entitled Standardized Data Sets and Communication Protocols that would
be available at the Commission. The Commission included this document in the NOPR and commenters raised issues with
respect to the proposed provisions.

El Paso requests clarification that a pipeline can leave fields in the data sets blank if the pipeline's tariff does
not require the information to be provided. It cites, as an example, differences in pipelines' tariffs as to whether
volumetric releases are subject to minimum quantity requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ANR contends the definitions of the terms mandatory and optional, as used for some fields in the data sets, are confusing.
It submits mandatory refers to data fields that every pipeline must support, while optional refers to data fields
pipelines may offer at their discretion, unless their individual tariffs require that those fields be supported.
If optional means that all pipelines must support the field, thereby permitting releasing shippers or bidders with
the option of including information in the field, ANR asserts it would have to incur added expense to redesign its EBB
to include these fields.

As an example of the difference in definition, an optional field is releaser contract number. Data Set I.1, line 6.

pipelines must provide the field so releasing shippers have the ability to include the information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Commission understands that El Paso's and ANR's interpretation of the manner in which the data sets
are designed to operate accords with the intent of the Working Groups, and the Commission agrees with that approach.
The Commission, however, sees a need to provide further clarification of the operation of the data sets and the mandatory
and optional characterization of certain fields. At the outset, it is important to recognize that these data sets
must apply to all pipelines, and, therefore, the Working Groups had to design them to be flexible enough to accommodate
the different operational characteristics and information requirements of different pipelines. Implementation
of the data sets perforce will differ across pipelines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The data sets are organized along the following lines. First, they are divided into generic groups for offers, bids,
awards, withdrawals, operationally available capacity, and system wide notices. Some of these groups are then divided
into specialized data sets, for example for receipt and delivery point information or for storage releases. Each
of these subsets contain mandatory, optional, or contingent fields.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All pipelines must support the six broad categories of data sets. Pipeline support of the subsets within each category,
however, may depend on the operational characteristics of individual pipelines.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 For example, data sets are included for receipt and delivery point information and for segment information although
not all pipelines are segment systems. Pipelines will choose from among the combination of these data sets the ones
that best present the relevant information for their systems.

The easiest example is the storage data sets which obviously will not have to be supported by pipelines without storage
fields.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All pipelines choosing a particular data set will be required to support the mandatory fields in that data set. Pipelines
are not required by this rule to support the optional fields. Some pipelines, however, may be required by their tariffs
or other requirements, to support some of the optional fields.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, pipelines must display all information, whether mandatory or optional, on their on-line EBBs. For example,
if a pipeline is not now displaying mandatory information on its on-line EBB, it must revise its display format to accommodate
that information.

As mentioned earlier, the Working Groups are continuing to make refinements in the data sets. In making these refinements,
they should make a further effort to clarify how pipelines must implement these requirements, such as which fields
pipelines must support and which are optional.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Enron suggests the standardized data sets should be minimum requirements that pipelines can supplement to accommodate
tariff provisions. As an example, it claims the data sets do not accommodate Florida Gas' proposal to permit several
shippers temporarily to combine their capacity rights to facilitate release transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is not sure what flexibility Enron is requesting. Pipelines cannot add or delete fields from the capacity
data sets because standardization requires that all pipelines use the same structure for downloading, so shippers
can process that information using the same computer software. For example, if pipelines could add new data fields,
shippers' ASC X12 software might be unable to interpret the information because the software is keyed to the specific
fields on the implementation guide. Moreover, the Working Groups anticipated the need to accommodate special release
offers or unique circumstances and included special terms and miscellaneous note fields for providing such details.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 As discussed previously, the Commission recognizes that pipelines may uncover difficulties in correlating their
information requirements with the downloadable data sets and the Commission anticipated possibly having to make
corrections to the data sets. The best way for pipelines to avoid problems is to begin the implementation process immediately
so they can report difficulties to the Working Groups for resolution prior to implementation.

Enron did not describe the specific problem created by combination offers, and the Commission cannot discern why
it could not be accommodated within the prescribed data sets. For example, the combination offer could be assigned
a single offer number (Data Set I.1, line 3) with any special circumstances described in the miscellaneous field (Data
Set I.1, line 52).

2. Date and Time Stamps
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal put forward by Working Groups 1 and 2 included fields identifying the date and time when release offers,
bids, withdrawals of bids or offers, and capacity awards are posted on pipelines' EBBs. No consensus was reached over
whether fields should be included to identify when pipelines actually received offers, bids, or withdrawals or made
the determination to award capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NOPR proposed to require the inclusion of fields for bid receipt date and time, but not for the date and time offers
and withdrawals were received or capacity awarded. Since releasing shippers and pipelines may choose the first come,
first served method to break ties, the Commission found that routine posting of the bid receipt date and time would
permit shippers to verify the award of capacity without having to contact the pipeline. The Commission did not propose
to include the date and time fields for receipt of offers and withdrawals or capacity awards, concluding this information
was not as important to capacity release transactions as the bid information. The Commission stated, however, that
information about the date and time offers and withdrawals were received and capacity awards determined must be provided
by the pipelines upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters support the Commission's decision to include only the information about bid receipt in the standardized
data sets.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
26
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Some request clarification as to whether pipelines must include both the date and time bids are received and posted
as mandatory fields.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
27
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Process Gas Consumers Group contends the Commission should require inclusion of all the contested items. It contends
the date and time for receipt of capacity withdrawals is particularly important because releasing shippers have
only a limited right to withdraw offers; it maintains the date and time information is needed so bidders can determine
whether that right has been exercised validly. It contends pipelines easily can make all the contested information
available in electronic form. The National Registry requests that even if pipelines are not required to post information
concerning the receipt of offers and withdrawals and determination of capacity awards, they should be required to
provide this information in electronic form when requested.

The Commission adheres to its decision not to require pipelines routinely to post the receipt date and time for capacity
offers and withdrawals and the date and time capacity awards are made. The Working Groups could not reach agreement
on providing the additional information, and, as stated in the NOPR, the Commission does not find that this information
is as crucial to capacity release, or will be needed as frequently, as the bid information. The Commission will not
require pipelines to provide the additional information in electronic form, because such a requirement would not
be significantly different than requiring the routine, electronic posting of this information, which the Commission
has determined is not necessary. The ability of users to obtain the information for offers, withdrawals, and awards
upon request appears sufficient. The Commission clarifies that both the bid receipt and bid posting data fields are
mandatory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PEC Pipeline Group contends the date and time for bids should be the posting time, arguing if receipt date and time is
used, the information would be unreliable because the bids would not have been verified for accuracy. It maintains
only the date and time of verified bids should be used to break ties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission agrees, in principle, that the appropriate information to include is the date and time used to break
ties. However, in most instances, that will be the date and time bids are received, not when they are verified. For example,
when bids are submitted near the end of bidding periods, the pipeline may not verify the bids until after the bid window
closes. Under a first come, first served tie breaking system, capacity would be awarded to the highest bid received
first in time even if the bid was not verified until later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Operationally Available Capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission proposed to adopt the Working Group's consensus agreement that pipelines provide information on
the amount of unscheduled capacity available at specific locations, such as receipt and delivery points, mainline,
or mainline segments. This field serves to identify the capacity that would be available as interruptible service
from the pipeline. Edison contends this definition would not allow shippers to determine whether firm or interruptible
capacity is available. It suggests operationally available capacity be defined as the capacity a firm shipper can
nominate at a point, asserting this definition would include interruptible capacity that can be displaced by a firm
shipper. Transco contends the amount of unscheduled capacity is proprietary information that would not be provided
in the free market. Williston Basin does not oppose this requirement, but states shippers may be able to use this information
only for trend analysis, not for making decisions on a daily basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds the requirement to provide information on operationally available or unscheduled capacity
is necessary to comply with the requirement that pipelines identify the interruptible capacity available on their
systems.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
28
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The unscheduled capacity at a point reveals the capacity available as interruptible service. In response to Edison's
comment, the Commission finds that the consensus approach is adequate at this point to disclose both the firm and interruptible
capacity available to potential shippers. The operationally available capacity reveals interruptible service
and pipelines also are required to post the firm service they have available.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
29
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Working Groups still are considering issues relating to operationally available capacity, and the Commission
will be open to modification of this definition if needed.

For example, the Commission is not certain whether Edison and Transco principally are concerned with the definition
of operationally available (or unscheduled) capacity or with the different, albeit somewhat related, issue of whether
additional fields are required to divide scheduled (or nominated) capacity into firm and interruptible components.
The issue of identifying the firm and interruptible components of nominated capacity is still under deliberation
by the Working Groups, and Edison and Transco will have a further opportunity to address these issues in the Working
Group meetings.

ANR asserts that the data field for operationally available capacity should indicate that the data may be estimates.
It also suggests an additional data field to enable the pipeline to qualify the accuracy of any information. The Commission
agrees with ANR that the information in this field may be estimates and leaves to the Working Groups the decision on
whether another field is necessary to convey information about how the estimates are provided.

As discussed earlier, NGSA suggested pipelines be required to make compliance filings and it submits that these filings
include information on the locations at which operationally available information will be provided, the manner
of display, and the timeliness of the data. WEV suggests generally that the information provided under the data sets
be as current as the pipeline can provide. While pipelines will not be required to make compliance filings to implement
this rule, they should provide users with adequate information about the locations at which they are reporting the
information and the timeliness of the information, which should be as current as is possible. Since the Commission
will have access to the pipelines' EBBs, it can monitor the adequacy of the information pipelines provide.

4. Disclosure of Minimum Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hadson contends the Commission should eliminate the field providing for disclosure of minimum price terms (Data
Set I.1, lines 23 and 24). It contends disclosure of this information while the market is open facilitates collusion
among releasing shippers to maintain higher prices in a falling market. The Commission will not eliminate this field
because it comports with the Commission's policy of providing releasing shippers with the option of having their
minimum conditions posted on the EBB.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
31
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This technical proceeding is not the proper forum to reexamine the Commission's policy in this regard. The Commission
notes, however, that, in a free market, sellers can choose to disclose minimum price conditions if they find such disclosure
beneficial. For example, stating a minimum price protects against the possibility a deal will fail simply because
a buyer submits a bid lower than the minimum price even though it is willing to pay the minimum price if it had known this
condition. Moreover, since minimum price terms are public, the Commission can monitor the situation, and eliminate
this field, if experience shows it does facilitate collusion.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 ASC X12 standards provides an electronic data submission capability that allows computers to exchange information
over communication lines using standardized formats. To facilitate these transfers, the ASC X12 standards provide
standardized transaction sets for different types of transactions, such as requests for quotations and responses
to such requests.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

transaction sets must be customized to individual applications by correlating or ``mapping'' the specific information

A few comments address the proposed implementation date for ASC X12. Tenneco asserts the April 1, 1994 implementation
date should not include EDI compliance, because EDI should be implemented only when trading partners agree. AER/MRT
suggest the date is too ambitious for ASC X12 implementation. PEC Pipeline Group maintains ANSI must approve the implementation
guide developed by Gas*Flow and asserts obtaining this approval could affect the timing of ASC X12 implementation
as well as the commitment of ASC X12 software vendors to guarantee the use of their software with these data sets. Despite
these concerns, PEC Pipeline Group is willing to go forward and implement ASC X12 based on Gas*Flow's recommendations.

Tenneco argues no implementation date for ASC X12 be set, contending implementation should occur when trading partners
agree. As the comments suggest, EBB operators need lead time to modify their system to incorporate ASC X12 downloads.
The Commission, therefore, concludes it needs to set a date by which ASC X12 downloads will be available to ensure that
users wanting this service can obtain it expeditiously. As specified by Working Group 4, the details of any special
arrangements for access to ASC X12 data between the pipeline and a trading partner would be worked out between those
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other commenters address the Commission's proposal to use Gas*Flow to prepare the implementation guide. UDC and
Tenneco support the use of Gas*Flow, but Tenneco suggests the Gas*Flow documentation should be submitted to the Working
Groups prior to submission to the Commission. Columbia Gas believes the Commission's estimate of one month for Gas*Flow
to prepare the implementation guide is overly optimistic and provides too little opportunity for the industry to
participate in development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission expects Gas*Flow to continue its current procedure of receiving industry comment on its proposed
implementation guide and to submit the guide to the Working Groups for their final approval. The extension of the implementation
date until June 1, 1994, provides Gas*Flow with sufficient time to obtain industry input and still finalize the implementation
guide in time for the industry to meet the June 1, 1994 date. Working Groups 1 and 2 and Gas*Flow should coordinate their
efforts to ensure that any additional revisions made by the Working Groups in the data sets are made in sufficient time
to ensure that EBB operators can implement the ASC X12 downloads by June 1, 1994. Once the implementation guide is completed,
the Commission will include the guide with its data sets.

 They generally argue mandating a second download in ASCII format is not worth the increased expense and maintain the
resources could be better devoted to development of ASC X12. They recommend ASCII downloads should remain a pipeline
option, as proposed by Working Group 4. AER/MRT and Northwest, on the other hand, recommend ASCII downloads replace
ASC X12, contending that ASCII is less costly, and faster and more efficient to implement than ASC X12 and that their
customers prefer ASCII to ASC X12. Others support the Commission's proposal of maintaining ASCII as an adjunct to
ASC X12 since some users may not have ASC X12 capability and ASCII would ensure those users could download the data.

The Commission will not substitute ASCII downloads for ASC X12 as suggested by Northwest and AER/MRT. Even if ASCII
downloads would be less expensive to prepare initially, as Northwest and AER/MRT contend, the consensus of the industry
was to provide for download capability using ASC X12 because it provided significant benefits when compared with
downloads using ASCII format. Some of these benefits include the availability of already standardized and well-accepted
procedures and the concomitant software and businesses available to implement the technology. The Commission anticipates
that, as ASC X12 is more widely used in the gas industry, users will recognize the advantages to using ASC X12, as they
have in other industries, and it will become the industry standard for communication. Nevertheless, to ease the transition
to ASC X12 for those customers not yet familiar with the ASC X12 technology, the Commission will require EBB operators
to provide for downloading capability in a flat ASCII format as well.

2. Protocols for Communications Software and Hardware, Access Requirements, and Log-On Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters raise questions about the Commission's proposed protocols relating to the software and modem speeds
used to access EBBs, the requirements for obtaining access to EBBs, and the procedures and principles for logging-on
to computers. Columbia Distribution argues the Commission's proposed protocols fail to reflect two principles
to which the pipelines agreed: the pipelines' recognition of the need to develop a mechanism under which users can
log-on to multiple EBBs with one phone call; and their commitment to work in good faith to address other customer concerns,
such as log-on procedures, additional file transfer options, and other logistical concerns. IPAA suggests a standardized
basic user interface must be developed, as opposed to each pipeline specifying a different communications package.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the statements mentioned by Columbia Distribution reflected a goal for future discussions, rather than
a consensus on specific procedures or principles, the Commission did not include them in its current protocols. The
Commission recognizes that further standardization of access requirements could reduce the burden on users which
have to access many pipeline EBBs. But Working Group 4 concluded, from its review of pipeline EBBs, that adoption of
one standard communication package for accessing EBBs was made impracticable at this time by the proliferation of
different hardware and other operating considerations used by the various pipeline EBBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
40
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Instead, it reached consensus on the principle that each EBB operator must provide a script detailing its log-on procedures
which is compatible with the software package used to access the EBB and must provide for file downloads through VANs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
41
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission, therefore, will not require further standardization in this area at this time, but will leave any
such modifications to the continuing Working Group deliberations.

Columbia Distribution also asserts some pipelines are proposing to make electronic contracting mandatory for certain
transactions; it contends electronic contracting raises legal and business practice issues that should be addressed

Northwest contends the Commission should not require pipelines to support the 2400 baud modem speed because any speed
slower than 9600 baud will place too great a burden on the EBB communication network. It recommends each pipeline be
able to choose the appropriate modem speed so long as it identifies the hardware necessary to access the EBB. Working
Group 4 reached consensus on the principle that pipelines must support a minimum modem speed so all potential users
will have reasonable access to the EBBs.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
43
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission will not disturb the consensus, since Working Group 4's rationale is reasonable and the Commission

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission recognizes that modem speeds higher than 9600 are in use. The Commission is amending the protocols
to provide that EBB operators supporting such higher modem speeds must comply with the recognized national or international
standards governing modem communication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transco recommends changes to three of the communication protocols. First, it argues the Commission should clarify
that the requirement for 24-hour EDI access (protocol ID) is subject to two separate contingencies, required periodic
maintenance and unpredicted downtime. The Commission sees no need to change this language from what was proposed
by Working Group 4; the possibility of unforseen events causing computer problems is well understood and need not
be addressed separately. Second, Transco contends the Commission's proposed language on advance authorization
for third-party access to commercially sensitive data (protocol IIIA) is unclear because it does not specify that
the pipeline's customer must provide the authorization.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
44
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission agrees that the customer must authorize access to commercially sensitive data and will modify this
principle accordingly. Third, Transco asserts the Commission's proposed language for log-on scripts (protocol
IVB) does not reflect the principle put forward by Working Group 4, because it fails to make clear that the script for
customized software packages is part of the customized package, not a separate software code. The Commission will
modify this protocol to reflect this principle.

C. Common Codes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission found the post-Order No. 636 business environment and the computerization of capacity
release transactions required the development of common, standardized codes in two areas: Codes to identify companies;
and common transaction point codes to enable shippers to use a single coding structure to identify pipeline points,
particularly interconnect points between pipelines. Working Group 5 had identified, but had not finalized, a process
for developing both sets of codes. In the NOPR, the Commission stated that it expected Working Group 5 to finalize its
proposal for common company codes by February 1, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For common transaction points, Working Group 5 proposed an approach in which a third-party (code assignor) would
prepare a computerized cross-reference table correlating pipelines' proprietary codes (as verified and updated
by the pipelines) to a common code. Those wanting to use the common code would maintain the cross-reference table on
their computers and could convert proprietary pipeline codes to the common code, and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
vice versa.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission was concerned about the feasibility of this process, at least in the short term, because Working Group
5 had not worked out the details of the approach (such as how to select a code assignor, pay for the costs of the initial
assignment and continued maintenance, or distribute the code) and had suggested this process be undertaken by a yet
undeveloped gas industry standards board. Due to the importance of this issue, the Commission gave the Working Group
until October 1, 1993, to finalize this approach or reach another consensus approach. If no consensus was reached,
the Commission proposed to select a common code and require the pipelines to make the translation to the common code.
The Commission requested comments on whether it should adopt the PI&hyph;GRID code developed by the Petroleum Information
Corporation or another common code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters support the development of a common code and the selection of the PI&hyph;GRID code if consensus on
an alternative is not reached.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
45
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Columbia Distribution and Exxon contend the pipelines, not the users, should make the translation. Pipelines contend
that requiring them to make the translation to the common code would increase costs significantly, because it would
affect all their computer operations, such as those for accounting, scheduling, and management, which are based
on the use of proprietary codes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 They assert Commission selection of the common code could impede the cooperative efforts of the industry to date and
recommend the Commission permit Working Group 5 to continue its efforts.

On October 12, 1993, Working Group 5 filed its report which detailed its consensus agreement on a code assignor process
along the lines of its previous proposal. As discussed below, the Commission is adopting the Working Group's proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The Proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The common code structure proposed by the Working Group would consist of two components. The first would be the code
number itself, a 16 digit number, which according to the Working Group, would provide the user with some information
about each point.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
47
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The second is a common code data base consisting of data elements that will be associated with each common code. These
data elements include such information as the name of the point, the owner operator of the point, a flow indicator showing
the direction of gas flow at the point, and a point locator (e.g., geographic coordinates, survey coordinates, or
line number or mile marker) to be provided when the information is available.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
For example, for each non-well facility point, the first two numbers indicate the state; the second three, the county;
the next five a surface location within the state; the next two, the facility code; the next two, a sub number identifying
components of certain types of facilities (e.g., gas plant inlets from tailgates); and the final two, a detail number
identifying multiple facilities at the same location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposal, PI&hyph;GRID will be the code assignor and will provide a copy of the data base to any requestor
at a price reflecting only its distribution and handling costs. The Working Group also proposes that various Code
Distributors will enter into agreements with PI&hyph;GRID to distribute the code. These agreements would provide
that the Code Distributors would not be able to charge for the data base itself, but would be able to charge for other
``value added'' services, such as selective extraction of information from the data base.

The Working Group envisions a series of contracts, beginning with a master agreement between PI&hyph;GRID and a consortium
of the gas industry. If a gas industry standards board eventually is developed, it would then take over this contract.
PI&hyph;GRID would enter into contracts based on the master agreement with Code Distributors, and the Code Distributors
would enter into agreements with users specifying the services Distributor will provide.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on discussions with PI-GRID, the Working Group anticipates six months will be required to establish and validate
the common codes for a large majority of interstate pipelines. If the industry begins the coding process this winter,
the Working Group expects the creation of a complete common code data base by the 1994&hyph;95 winter heating season.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, all business will be transacted with pipelines using proprietary codes. Those wanting to use
the common code will have to program their computers to translate between common and proprietary codes to communicate
with pipelines. Pipelines will be required to verify and validate their proprietary code information to PI-GRID.
The proposal also provides for ongoing assignment of new transaction points and modifications to existing points.
The information for these revisions must be provided at least ten days before a new or modified code goes into effect.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Working Group states that, at this point, the demand for common codes is unknown; some parties using only one or
a small number of pipelines may prefer to continue using proprietary codes. Given this level of uncertainty, the Working
Group contends the code assignor process provides a number of benefits compared to a requirement that all pipelines
adopt a common code. It provides a verified and validated common code system to those who need it, while ensuring that
the costs of using common codes are borne by the users, not those still preferring to use proprietary codes. It will
provide consistent communication between pipelines and customers using proprietary codes, avoiding the difficulties
that would be created if business transactions and other customer contacts employed different coding systems. And,
it will provide an initial first test of the level of demand for, and efficiency of using, a common code. Should a common
code prove efficient, the Working Group expects the market to evolve to the point where common codes will be used for
all communications.

3. Comments on the Working Group Filing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Process Gas Consumers Group and NYMEX/Enersoft raise objections to the code assignor process. Process Gas Consumers
Group objects to the shipper having the responsibility for maintaining a rather large data set on its computer and
having to develop, or acquire from others, the ``intelligence'' needed to compare capacity release offers among
pipelines to identify possible alternative transportation paths.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It maintains that the most burdensome task facing pipelines is verifying their proprietary codes and that including
the common code in the capacity release data sets would not be particularly burdensome. It emphasizes that including
such codes in the data sets would be for informational purposes only, and would not require the pipelines to conduct
business using the common codes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
It also suggests that a common code system could include mile markers or other geographic location information so
software could identify delivery points either upstream or downstream of a location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NYMEX/EnerSoft contend pipelines should not be able to require customers to communicate using proprietary codes,
because users will then have to obtain translation software to convert the common codes to the proprietary codes.
It maintains that having the pipelines perform the translation is preferable since there are fewer pipelines than
market participants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other commenters support the code assignor process. AER/MRT supports the use of proprietary codes for communication
between pipelines and users, because use of one code will minimize the likelihood of miscommunication. It also argues
requiring shippers to perform the translation appropriately requires those using common codes to bear the costs
of that use. Gaslantic contends the Commission should ensure that initial and updated common codes are distributed
on an open-access basis, and IPAA similarly supports the provision of the data base without cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Registry suggests two clarifications. It is concerned about the possibility that PI-GRID, as code assignor,
might delay distribution of the code in order to degrade the value of services provided by competitors. It suggests
PI-GRID should be required to file a letter with the Commission when it has completed more than 90% of the cross-referencing
for each pipeline and provide the code to distributors at that point. It further contends that information on the location
of points (such as geographic coordinates or pipeline line number of mile marker) is critical, but that the proposed
data sets requires this information to be included only when available. It maintains the Commission should clarify
when this information must be provided, suggesting it should be supplied for path pipelines, but not for point-to-point
or network pipelines.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
50
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In line with this request, it suggests the Commission require pipelines to include in their next Form 567 filing an
identification of the proprietary point code associated with the points in the flow diagrams.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the level of support for the code assignor process, the Commission accepts the Working Group proposal and will
implement it by requiring pipelines to provide a mechanism through which any person can obtain a validated computerized
data base that will provide the ability to convert from pipeline proprietary codes to a common code. The Working Group
stated the code assignment process could be completed by the start of the 1994&hyph;95 winter heating season, and
the Commission, therefore, will require the implementation of this approach by November 1, 1994. The Commission
also will require pipelines to ensure that the common codes and data base, and any updates, will be provided without
charge, except for reasonable distribution and handling fees.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will adopt the data sets as proposed by the Working Group with one modification. The Commission will
require that the point locator information be mandatory. The Commission agrees with the commenters that the ability
to locate pipeline points in relation to other points on the system is important if users are to use the common code data
base to determine if a package of released capacity fits their needs. When pipelines verify their proprietary codes
to PI-GRID, they must include information sufficient to enable users to locate a point on one pipeline in relation
to other points. At this point, the pipelines can choose the method of locating the points, such as geographic coordinates,
line number or line marker, but the Commission envisions that eventually all pipelines should move to using geographic
coordinates so that points on different pipelines can be related to each other. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gaslantic and IPAA support the provision of the data base and updates at no cost to the user. The Working Group report
states distributors cannot charge more than postage and handling costs for providing the code itself, but can charge
for value added services. The Commission is requiring the pipelines to ensure that users can obtain the data base and
any updates at a price that reflects only reasonable costs of distribution and handling. Additional charges, however,
may be assessed for other value added services relating to updates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement that point locator information be mandatory for all pipelines obviates the requests by the National
Registry for a further definition of the term ``available'' to describe when point locator information will be provided
and for requiring point location disclosure in Form 567 filings. The provision of point locator information also
should satisfy Process Gas Consumers Group's request for geographic location points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Registry suggests that the Commission require PI-GRID to file a statement with the Commission when it
has completed more than 90% of the cross-referencing for each pipeline and provide the code to distributors at that
point. The Commission has set a deadline for final dissemination of the common code data base and finds no reason to
require filings as the data are compiled or piecemeal implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NYMEX/Enersoft contend pipelines should be required to conduct business using common codes. The Commission will
not impose this requirement at this time, since it goes beyond the consensus agreement reached by Working Group 5.
Shippers will be able to use the cross-reference table to convert electronically from the common codes to the proprietary
codes for communication with the pipeline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Process Gas Consumers Group maintains that including the common codes in the capacity release data sets would be more
efficient, although they do not suggest pipelines be required to conduct business using the common code. This suggestion
too goes beyond the consensus agreement reached by the Working Groups, and the Commission will not impose it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, even if the common code (consisting of 16 digits) was included in the capacity release data sets, the efficiency
of the process might not be enhanced to a significant degree. The extensive data base that goes along with the common
code would not be on the EBBs, and users may very well need the underlying data base to provide the information they require
to perform an analysis of capacity paths. As described earlier, the sequence of numbers in the code itself provides
users only with limited information, such as identifying the state and county of the point. But the entire common code
data base provides additional information about points, such as the point locator information, that users may well
need to use the common code effectively in comparing capacity releases over multiple pipelines. The Commission further
notes that Working Groups 1 and 2 have included an optional field for common codes which pipelines may make available
to their users. Use of this field may provide a test of whether bidders would derive value from access to the common code
numbers, without also having the underlying data base available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, the Commission finds that the industry has taken a positive step forward by designing a process that
will ensure that those wanting to use common codes can do so effectively within a reasonable period of time. The Commission
expects use of this system will prove to enhance efficiency by better enabling shippers to manage the transportation
of gas supplies across the nationwide pipeline grid. As pipelines review and update their computer and financial
systems in light of the changed business environment created by Order No. 636, the Commission expects them to incorporate
the use of common codes. Ultimately, the Commission anticipates that the common codes ultimately will become the
standard used for all transactions and communications between pipelines and their customers.

VII. Issues not Addressed in the Standardized Data Sets and Communication Protocols
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Working Group reports included minority positions on some issues, and these issues also were addressed in the
comments on the Working Group reports. On several issues, the Commission recommended that the Working Groups continue
their efforts to seek resolution, with reports to be made by February 1, 1994. Others involved policy questions which
the Commission found were beyond the scope of this proceeding and would be better examined in other fora.

A. Proposed Additions to the Standardized Data Sets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Index of Purchasers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Registry proposed that an Index of Purchasers (Index), which would disclose a variety of information
about the capacity rights of firm capacity holders, be available on EBBs and through downloadable files.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 It asserted this index could be used to establish the baseline contractual rights of current holders of pipeline capacity,
information which it believed was needed so potential purchasers could determine the releasable rights of firm capacity
holders. In the NOPR, the Commission did not propose to include the proposed Index because the proposal appeared too
burdensome and costly. But the Commission stated it considered a more limited Index to have value in identifying firm
shippers with releasable capacity. It suggested the Working Groups work on a cost-effective method of presenting
such information.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters contend the benefits of an Index do not warrant the cost, since shippers willing to release capacity
are free to post offers to sell and potential purchasers can post so-called want ads, advertising the capacity they
want to acquire.

The Commission will not decide this issue now because it is still being considered by the Working Groups. But the Commission
continues to find merit in the concept of providing a cost-effective electronic Index of purchasers and expects the
participants in the Working Groups to consider this issue in the same open-minded and conciliatory manner they used
to build consensus on other issues in this proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also did not propose to make data items for contract number and replacement contract number mandatory
fields, finding that these items were tied to the proposed Index.
<FOOTCITE>55</FOOTCITE>
 The National Registry contends its request to make contract and replacement contract numbers mandatory fields is
independent of the Index. It asserts these data are needed by the Commission, state commissions, and others to create
an audit trail to verify the ownership of capacity being released and acquired.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Commission will not require the inclusion of contract and replacement contract number in the data sets
at this time, it does recognize that pipelines will need to maintain a correlation between release transactions and
the contracts resulting from those transactions for Commission audit requirements if not also for the pipelines'
own purposes. Since pipelines must maintain this information in any event, the Working Groups should consider making
this information mandatory in the downloadable data sets to make access easier.

2. Nominations for Firm and Interruptible Capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No consensus was reached in the Working Groups whether to include fields showing confirmed firm and interruptible
nominations and a field showing whether no-notice service is available at a location. Proponents of providing this
information contended it was needed for releasing shippers and bidders to assess the value of released capacity,
while opponents maintained it is not needed to bid on capacity, but would unfairly tilt the market in favor of bidders.
The parties also disagreed on the availability, and costs, of providing the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NOPR, the Commission found that the available information did not permit it to resolve the issue. Moreover,
the Commission recognized the Working Groups had little time to consider this matter fully and, therefore, strongly
encouraged them to continue their discussions and to explore alternatives for providing information relevant to
the purchasing of capacity that is operationally feasible to provide at reasonable cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments on the NOPR essentially parallel the previous positions: proponents state the information is needed
to make business judgments and is information that would be available in a free market;
<FOOTCITE>56</FOOTCITE>
 opponents contend it would undermine capacity release, is too costly to provide, would not be provided in a free market,
and unfairly requires shippers to divulge competitive information that would be used against them.
<FOOTCITE>57</FOOTCITE>
 NGSA and Destec Energy comment that the Commission must be prepared to judge the merits of disputes, like this one,
which are based on competing economic interests. FMA asserts that for unresolved disputes, special consideration

The Commission finds that the Working Groups should continue to examine and explore means of reaching a compromise
on this issue. The Commission does not agree that the views of any one group should predominate over others. The parties
should seek to accommodate each other's interests, as they have on other issues, a process more likely to produce a
resolution preferable to both sides than if the Commission decides. Should agreement on whether to provide the information
prove elusive, the parties should, at a minimum, seek to agree upon a cost effective method of providing the information
if the Commission determines it is necessary.

B. Communication Protocols for Uploading Files and Downloading Subsets of Files 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission stated that development of standards permitting users to transmit (upload) files to the
pipelines' computers as well as to download subsets of files could increase the efficiency of the capacity allocation
mechanism. File upload capability, for example, would permit bidders to submit their bids electronically without
having to sign-on to the pipelines' on-line EBBs. The ability to download a subset of a capacity release file, such
as release information received after a certain date, would permit users to eliminate unneeded information from
the files they download and also increase the efficiency of the communication process. The Commission endorsed Working
Group 4's plan to continue its efforts to develop these capabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters support file uploading to provide efficient communication.
<FOOTCITE>58</FOOTCITE>
 Others, principally pipelines, raise questions about file uploading. They contend file uploading is not as well
suited as on-line EBBs to handling bids submitted near the close of bidding periods, because, unlike EBBs, uploading
is not an interactive system permitting immediate notification to bidders of errors in their bids.

Edison states downloading of file subsets should be a priority. Columbia Gas maintains downloads of subsets based

downloads would be too expensive. UDC suggests the Commission should not mandate file uploading or downloading of
file subsets, but should trust the market to develop these capabilities if they are needed.

The Commission is convinced that the development of effective file uploading and subset downloading capability
would markedly enhance communication efficiency related to capacity release. Working Group 4 should continue to
assign a high priority to developing standards in this area. The Commission recognizes the concerns with uploads
submitted close to the end of the bidding period, but is confident the Working Groups can develop the necessary standards
to deal with this issue.

C. Standardization of Non-Capacity Release Business Transactions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The industry established Working Group 3 to consider the development of standards relating to business practices,
other than capacity release, resulting from the business changes fostered by pipeline restructuring under Order
No. 636. In its report, the Working Group did not propose any standards; it outlined the areas of highest priority and
its process for continuing to examine these issues. Several commenters support the continuation of these efforts,
maintaining standardization of these business data is critically important to the industry.
<FOOTCITE>61</FOOTCITE>
 Vesta contends the Commission should require the pipelines now to provide the 16 data items tentatively established
by Working Group 3 as being the most critical. Others oppose the continuation of Working Group 3's deliberations,
arguing standards in these areas are not required by Order No. 636 and the Commission should limit its promulgation
of standards to those essential for capacity release.

From over 66 items proposed for review, Working Group 3 found 33 to be of high priority, and of those 33, focused its initial
review on ten elements.
<FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>
 In the Commission's view, standardization of these ten, or most of them, would provide a good departure point for this
effort. The Commission realizes all facets of the industry may not have equal need for all these elements, but these
elements would appear to have wide enough coverage that the benefits from standardization will be widespread. Moreover,
once standards are in place, those who may not now perceive a need for standards, may come to realize the standards will
make their business more efficient, and even those who do not need the standards themselves, stand to benefit if other
segments of the industry become more efficient.
<FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>
 The Working Group should propose an appropriate implementation schedule for the ten identified data elements. The
Working Group also should continue its efforts to identify which of the remaining 23 high priority data elements,
as well as any others, require standardization and propose a schedule for implementation of standards for these elements
as well.

D. Policy Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The minority reports and initial comments raised questions about three policy issues: the method of recovering the
costs of standardization, pipeline disclaimers of liability for EBB operation, and the disclosure of non-price
considerations underlying capacity release transactions. The Commission stated in the NOPR that such substantive
policy issues are beyond the scope of this proceeding and are more appropriately considered in individual proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Costs of Standardization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NOPR, the Commission recognized the concern of firm shippers that the costs of compliance with the EBB standards
should be spread equitably across all those benefitting from the standards. The Commission encouraged the industry
to consider methods for ensuring equitable sharing of such costs, such as user or access fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters support development of a fair and equitable method of allocating costs.
<FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>
 Transco and Williston Basin maintain EDI, in particular, is not suitable for all customers and suggest the costs of
implementing this technology should be borne by those benefitting from it. PSCW contends LDCs should not have to subsidize
the costs of providing information benefitting other parties and suggests an incremental pricing system for all
information beyond a basic level. A number of commenters are concerned about leaving the issue solely to rate cases.
<FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>
 They maintain the policy needs to be consistent across pipelines and urge the Commission to decide on the method for
allocating costs in this proceeding or in another generic proceeding, leaving implementation to individual rate
cases. Power Generators opposes inclusion of this issue in the Working Groups, because the success of the Groups was
due to their focus on technical issues.

INGAA suggests direct charges may be appropriate for additional services and features that go beyond the standards
to be adopted by the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Commission finds that its previous policy of permitting the pipelines to recover fixed costs through
a reservation charge and only variable costs through a usage charge is appropriate for the basic EBB service. This
basic service includes, at a minimum, the downloadable data sets and communication protocols established in this
rule, which the Commission finds are necessary to promote a viable capacity release market and should provide generalized
system-wide benefits to all users of the pipeline grid. Until additional standards are presented, the Commission
cannot determine whether they provide sufficient benefits to the industry as a whole to warrant inclusion in the basic
EBB package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For enhancements to the basic EBB service, which are not of general benefit, the Commission is open to considering
cost recovery approaches that will recover fixed costs from the limited number of users deriving benefit from the
service. The Commission encourages the industry to pursue such approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an example, pipelines could consider using a process for recovering the costs of enhancements to the standard EBB
package from only those customers that subscribe to the enhancements. The pipeline could explore with the users of
its EBB the costs of providing a particular service or group of services and methods of recovering these costs from
the subscribing users, such as through access fees, reservation charges, or direct charges. The pipeline and the
users also could establish mechanisms for reimbursing the initial subscribers if additional users later evince
an interest in obtaining the services. Once having obtained agreement from those customers desiring the service,
the pipeline could make a tariff filing to establish the method of recovery or submit an application or petition for
a declaratory order requesting advance Commission review of the proposed costs and charges.

Several commenters suggest the liability standard for EBB operations should be the same across all pipelines and,
therefore, should be resolved either in this proceeding or in another generic proceeding.

supports consideration of the issue in individual proceedings, but suggests the Commission restate here its standard
that pipeline liability for EBB operations should be no different than for other operations. UDC asks the Commission
to state that it will enforce its standard. Some parties contend the Commission should adopt a new standard, arguing
EBBs are not like other pipeline operations since parties other than the pipeline are responsible for providing information.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
71
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because verification of such information is time consuming, they recommend each party ensure the accuracy of the
information it provides. Con Edison, in contrast, argues that pipeline tariff provisions regarding EBB user indemnification
of the pipeline are too onerous and hold the EBB user to a higher standard of responsibility than applies to the pipeline.
Enron contends the issue is beyond the scope of this proceeding.

The Commission agrees that this issue goes beyond the technical concerns with standards development which were the
focus of this proceeding. The Commission can determine policy related issues in individual cases without having
to establish a new generic proceeding and already has addressed this issue in restructuring orders. The Commission
has adopted the principle that a pipeline's liability for EBB operations should be the same as for its other operations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

3. Non-Price Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
O&amp;R contends standards are needed to guard against capacity releases involving deals for indirect consideration,
such as capacity release transactions tied to gas supply arrangements. It asserts this issue is not better addressed
in individual proceedings, but requires a definitive policy statement. The Commission adheres to its conclusion
that this issue is outside the scope of this technical rulemaking and should not be an issue considered by the continuing
Working Group sessions. The Commission has addressed this concern in individual restructuring proceedings based
on the facts and circumstances in each case.

Commission need not articulate its policy through a generic proceeding, but can do so in individual proceedings.

E. Gas Industry Standards Board 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several of the Working Group reports, and initial comments, endorsed the development of a Gas Industry Standards
Board (GISB) which ultimately would replace the Working Groups and continue the development and maintenance of industry-wide
standards. In the NOPR, the Commission stated it was interested in this concept and invited submission of a proposal
as to how it would operate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters support an industry standards board in concept as long as all industry segments are represented,
but noted the concept is still in the planning phase so any detailed comments would be premature.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
75
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of commenters emphasized that the GISB concept should not interfere with the on-going efforts of the Working
Groups. El Paso did not support an industry standards board unless it was limited to communication format standards,
and O&amp;R contended such a board should be an advisory panel only. Con Edison, in contrast, contends the scope of
the board should be extended beyond electronic communication to include standardization relating to pipeline operations,
imbalances, and nominations.

On November 2, 1993, the Commission met with representatives from the Natural Gas Council to hear a report on the progress
of GISB. The Commission remains interested in this concept and looks forward to a detailed proposal. When the Commission
receives a proposal, it will give close consideration to the effects of such an independent industry standardization
effort on all facets of the gas industry, Commission regulation, and state regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the meantime, the Working Group efforts should continue apace. The Working Groups should not defer or delay the
development of standards in anticipation of the formation of a standards board. Moreover, they should ensure their
proposals can stand alone and should not rely upon the eventual existence of a standards board as the means to administer
the standards.

VIII. Environmental Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is required to prepare an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement for any action
that may have a significant adverse effect on the human environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
76
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission has categorically excluded certain actions from these requirements as not having a significant effect
on the human environment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
77
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The action taken here falls within the categorical exclusions in the Commission's regulations for rules that are
clarifying or procedural and that relate to information gathering, analysis, and dissemination.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
78
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Therefore, an environmental assessment is unnecessary and has not been prepared in this rulemaking.

The required information under FERC&hyph;549(A) enables the Commission to carry out its legislative mandate under
the NGA and NGPA and will ensure a viable capacity release market under Commission Order No. 636. Specifically, the
required information allows the Commission to review/monitor capacity release transactions and firm and interruptible
capacity made available directly from pipelines and to take appropriate action, where and when necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is submitting notification of these information/EBB requirements to OMB for its review and approval.
Interested persons may send comments regarding the burden estimates or any other aspect of these EBB standards/information
requirements, including suggestions for reducing the estimated burden, by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services
Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415]. Comments on the requirements of the subject final rule may also be sent to the Office

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its public information regulations to reflect changes already
adopted by the agency as a result of the 1986 amendments to the Freedom of Information Act (the FOIA), executive branch
directives, and judicial standards governing disclosure of agency records under the FOIA. In practice, FDA modified
its policies and procedures to comply with these changes as they became effective. The regulations are being updated
to reflect these changes. The agency is also adding clarifying language to certain of its public information regulations
and making technical changes necessary to update citations and cross-references.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's practice and policy under the FOIA have undergone a number of changes as a result of legislation, executive directives,
and judicial precedents over the past years. FDA modified and updated its practices and policies to comply with these
changes as they became effective. FDA is now formally amending its public information regulations to reflect changes
that were required by law and which have already been put into effect. Specifically, FDA is updating its public information
regulations to reflect provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508), the Freedom
of Information Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99&hyph;570), Executive Order 12600 (June 23, 1987) establishing predisclosure
notification procedures, guidelines promulgated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) (52 FR 10012 at 10018,
March 27, 1987), the revised Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) regulations at 45 CFR part 5, and the widely
adopted District of Columbia (D.C.) Circuit Court of Appeals opinion in

FDA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 704 F.2d 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1983). The agency is also adding language to &sect;&sect;20.53 and 20.85 (21 CFR 20.53 and
20.83) in order to clarify particular aspects of those regulations that have been the subject of some confusion. In
addition, FDA is making technical revisions to certain public information regulations to update citations to cross-references
that have changed since the last revision of part 20 (21 CFR part 20).

II. Procedural Amendments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Investigatory Records Compiled for Law Enforcement Purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language of &sect;20.64, regarding records compiled for law enforcement purposes, is being changed to conform
to the 1986 amendments to the FOIA, which broadened the FOIA exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7) that protects certain law enforcement records from mandatory public disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Disclosure to Congress 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 20.87 is being revised to reflect the provision of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that removed
the statutory barrier that previously prohibited FDA from disclosing certain trade secret information to Congress,
(Pub. L. 101&hyph;508). Section 4755(c)(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 amended section 301(j)
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 331(j)) in order to permit FDA to disclose to Congress
certain trade secret information that is otherwise prohibited from disclosure except to employees of DHHS or to the
courts in relevant judicial proceedings. Such disclosures to Congress may only be pursuant to a request from the Senate,
the House of Representatives, any committee or subcommittee with jurisdiction over the matter being investigated,
or any joint committee of Congress or any subcommittee of such joint committee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Trade Secret and Confidential Commercial Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12600, issued June 23, 1987, requires Federal agencies to establish predisclosure notification
procedures in certain circumstances before releasing commercial information submitted by businesses. FDA has
complied with the terms of the Executive Order since it became effective, and has followed the procedures adopted
by DHHS in the regulations published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 25, 1988 (53 FR 47697). To clarify these practices and for the convenience of the public, FDA is incorporating
DHHS' regulations concerning predisclosure notification into FDA's regulations governing the disclosure of trade
secret and confidential commercial information at &sect;20.61. Accordingly, the standards and procedures promulgated
by DHHS at 45 CFR 5.65(c), (d), and (e) are being added to FDA's public information regulations in &sect;20.61(d),
(e), and (f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 20.61 also is being amended to reflect the narrow definition of ``trade secret'' that was adopted by the D.C.
Circuit Court of Appeals in

FDA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 704 F.2d 1280, 1288 (D.C. Cir. 1983). That definition requires a direct relationship between the information being
protected and the productive process. The definition adopted by the D.C. Circuit in that case has become the most widely
adopted judicial test for defining trade secret information under the FOIA and is already codified in the DHHS FOIA
regulations at 45 CFR 5.65(a). This amendment to &sect;20.61 will not affect agency practice because FDA has distinguished
between trade secret and confidential commercial information in accordance with the definition in the

D. Fees and Fee Waivers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 20.42 and 20.43 are being amended to reflect changes required by the 1986 amendments to the FOIA concerning
fees and fee waivers and the OMB guidelines promulgated to implement those changes. FDA is adopting the standards
and procedures promulgated by DHHS at 45 CFR 5.41 through 5.45, except that 45 CFR 5.42(g) is excluded from &sect;20.42
because 45 CFR 5.42(g) pertains only to the Social Security Administration. In general, the regulations being adopted
codify the descriptions of categories of requesters, the new fee structure and fee limitations, and the revised standards
for fee waivers or reductions established by the 1986 amendments to the FOIA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 20.41 is being amended to remove the paragraphs that refer to $25 as the amount that triggers a requirement
for prepayment of FOIA fees. The guidelines promulgated by OMB and the DHHS regulations include an advance payment
provision for fees that exceed $250. That requirement is being included in revised &sect;20.42. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Clarifications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Indexing Trade Secrets and Confidential Commercial or Financial Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A recent report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) criticized FDA's regulation concerning &sect;20.53 Indexing
trade secrets and confidential or financial information. GAO believed that it would be an abrogation of the agency's
responsibilities to disclose information in those circumstances when a submitter failed to intervene to defend
against the release of its records. The report hypothesized circumstances in which a firm could suffer severe financial
loss because it could not afford legal representation to defend the competitive value of its commercial information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the regulation has been in effect for almost two decades, such a situation has never materialized. The agency
continues to believe that the burden of defending business related records should be borne by the owner and submitter
of such information, who is in the best position to explain the competitive harm that may result from disclosure. A
company's unwillingness to take steps to protect the information it has submitted to the agency and to index the records
at issue is ordinarily evidence to FDA that disclosure of the information is not likely to cause the submitter substantial
competitive harm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the agency has never and would not at any time abandon its responsibilities to protect information that is
truly prohibited from release. Although the situation has never previously arisen, there may be exceptional circumstances
that would make it unreasonable for FDA to expect a submitter to participate as an intervenor in defending the proprietary
value of its records. Accordingly, the language of the regulation is being amended to clarify that a company's failure
to intervene to defend the exempt status of its information and to itemize and index the disputed records is not treated
as an automatic waiver of the submitter's interest in protection of the information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Disclosure to Other Federal Agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A 1991 contract report ``FDA Safeguards Against Improper Disclosure of Financially Sensitive Information,'' which
was undertaken as part of the FDA Commissioner's integrity initiative, recommended that FDA obtain written pledges
of confidentiality when it provides nonpublic information to other Federal agencies, such as the Securities Exchange
Commission (SEC), as part of cooperative law enforcement efforts. FDA's regulations governing the disclosure of
information to other Federal agencies, &sect;20.85, is intended to require written commitments of confidentiality,
and staff manual guides and internal agency guidance have consistently instructed personnel to obtain such written
commitments. However, because the 1991 report named above suggested some confusion among FDA and other Department
and Federal employees, FDA is adding the word ``written'' to &sect;20.85 so that the regulation clearly states that
such disclosures can only be made pursuant to a ``written'' agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Technical Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 20.100 is being revised to update cross-references that have changed because agency regulations have been
amended or new regulations have been promulgated since the last revision of part 20. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the agency's current practice with respect to disclosure of records will not change as a result of any of these
amendments, and because the amendments set forth in section I. of this document are required either by statute, executive
branch directives, or judicial decisions, FDA finds for good cause under &sect;10.40(e) that notice and public procedure
are unnecessary (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) and (d)). However, under &sect;10.40(e), FDA is providing an opportunity
for comment to determine whether the regulations should subsequently be modified or revoked.

have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental

FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Executive
Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation
is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental,
public health and safety effects; distributive impacts; and equity). The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354)
requires analyzing options for regulatory relief for small businesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule amends the regulations for FDA's practice and policy under the FOIA. Because the amendments merely update
the regulations to reflect procedural changes already adopted by the agency as a result of legislation, executive
branch directives, or legal precedents, no additional impact is anticipated. Accordingly, FDA finds that this final
rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive Order 12866. In compliance with the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small businesses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;20.42 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Fees to be charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Categories of requests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section state, for each category of request, the type of fees that the Food and
Drug Administration will generally charge. However, for each of these categories, the fees may be limited, waived,
or reduced for the reasons given in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and in &sect;20.43 or for other reasons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Commercial use request. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the request is for a commercial use, the Food and Drug Administration will charge for the costs of search, review,
and duplication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Educational and scientific institutions and news media. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the request is from an educational institution or a noncommercial scientific institution, operated primarily
for scholarly or scientific research, or a representative of the news media, and the request is not for a commercial
use, the Food and Drug Administration will charge only for the duplication of documents. Also, the Food and Drug Administration
will not charge the copying costs for the first 100 pages of duplication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other requests. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the request is not the kind described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, then the Food and Drug Administration
will charge only for the search and the duplication. Also, the Food and Drug Administration will not charge for the
first 2 hours of search time or for the copying costs of the first 100 pages of duplication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General provisions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The Food and Drug Administration may charge search fees even if the records found are exempt from disclosure or
if no records are found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, there is no charge for the first 2 hours of search time, and those 2 hours
are spent on a computer search, then the 2 free hours are the first 2 hours of the operator's own operation. If the operator
spends less than 2 hours on the search, the total search fees will be reduced by the average hourly rate for the operator's
time, multiplied by 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If, under paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, there is no charge for the first 100 pages of duplication,
then those 100 pages are the first 100 pages of photocopies of standard size pages, or the first 100 pages of computer
printout. If this method to calculate the fee reduction cannot be used, then the total duplication fee will be reduced
by the normal charge for photocopying a standard size page, multiplied by 100. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) No charge will be made if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the
amount of the fee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If it is determined that a requester (acting either alone or together with others) is breaking down a single request
into a series of requests in order to avoid (or reduce) the fees charged, all these requests may be aggregated for purposes
of calculating the fees charged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Interest will be charged on unpaid bills beginning on the 31st day following the day the bill was sent. Provisions
in 45 CFR part 30, the Department of Health and Human Services regulations governing claims collection, will be used
in assessing interest, administrative costs, and penalties, and in taking actions to encourage payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fee schedule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration charges the following fees: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Manual searching for or reviewing of records. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When the search or review is performed by employees at grade GS&hyph;1 through GS&hyph;8, an hourly rate based on the
salary of a GS&hyph;5, step 7, employee; when done by a GS&hyph;9 through GS&hyph;14, an hourly rate based on the salary
of a GS&hyph;12, step 4, employee; and when done by a GS&hyph;15 or above, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS&hyph;15,
step 7, employee. In each case, the hourly rate will be computed by taking the current hourly rate for the specified
grade and step, adding 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits, and rounding to the nearest whole dollar. As of January
1, 1993, these rates were $12, $24, and $43 respectively. When a search involves employees at more than one of these
levels, the Food and Drug Administration will charge the rate appropriate for each. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Agreement to pay. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration generally assumes that a requester is willing to pay the fees charged for services
associated with the request. The requester may specify a limit on the amount to be spent. If it appears that the fees
will exceed the limit, the Food and Drug Administration will consult the requester to determine whether to proceed
with the search. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Advance payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a requester has failed to pay previous bills in a timely fashion, or if the Food and Drug Administration's initial
review of the request indicates that the charges will exceed $250, the requester will be required to pay past due fees
and/or the estimated fees, or a deposit, before the search for the requested records begins. In such cases, the requester
will be notified promptly upon receipt of the request, and the administrative time limits prescribed in &sect;20.41
will begin only after there is an agreement with the requester over payment of fees, or a decision that fee waiver or
reduction is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Billing and payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ordinarily, the requester will be required to pay all fees before the Food and Drug Administration will furnish the
records. At its discretion, the Food and Drug Administration may send the requester a bill along with or following
the records. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may do this if the requester has a history of prompt payment.
The Food and Drug Administration may also, at its discretion, aggregate the charges for certain time periods in order
to avoid sending numerous small bills to frequent requesters, or to businesses or agents representing requesters.
For example, the Food and Drug Administration might send a bill to such a requester once a month. Fees should be paid
in accordance with the instructions furnished by the person who responds to the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;20.43 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs will waive or reduce the fees that would otherwise be charged if disclosure
of the information meets both of the following tests: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations
or activities of the Government; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) It is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. These two tests are explained in paragraphs (b)
and (c) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public interest.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Disclosure of information satisfies the first test only if it furthers the specific public interest of being likely
to contribute significantly to public understanding of Government operations or activities, regardless of any
other public interest it may further. In analyzing this question, the Food and Drug Administration will consider
the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether the records to be disclosed pertain to the operations or activities of the Federal Government; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Whether disclosure of the records would reveal any meaningful information about Government operations or activities
that is not already public knowledge; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether disclosure will advance the understanding of the general public as distinguished from a narrow segment
of interested persons. Under this factor, the Food and Drug Administration may consider whether the requester is
in a position to contribute to public understanding. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may consider whether
the requester has such knowledge or expertise as may be necessary to understand the information, and whether the requester's
intended use of the information would be likely to disseminate the information to the public. An unsupported claim
to be doing research for a book or article does not demonstrate that likelihood, while such a claim by a representative
of the news media is better evidence; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Whether the contribution to public understanding will be a significant one, i.e., will the public's understanding
of the Government's operations be substantially greater as a result of the disclosure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Not primarily in the requester's commercial interest.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If disclosure passes the test of furthering the specific public interest described in paragraph (b) of this section,
the Food and Drug Administration will determine whether disclosure also furthers the requester's commercial interest
and, if so, whether this effect outweighs the advancement of that public interest. In applying this second test, the
Food and Drug Administration will consider the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Whether disclosure would further a commercial interest of the requester, or of someone on whose behalf the requester
is acting. Commercial interests include interests relating to business, trade, and profit. Both profit and nonprofit-making
corporations have commercial interests, as well as individuals, unions, and other associations. The interest of
a representative of the news media in using the information for news dissemination purposes will not be considered
a commercial interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If disclosure would further a commercial interest of the requester, whether that effect outweighs the advancement
of the public interest as defined in paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Deciding between waiver and reduction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If the disclosure of the information requested passes both tests described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section,
the Food and Drug Administration will normally waive fees. However, in some cases the Food and Drug Administration
may decide only to reduce the fees. For example, the Food and Drug Administration may do this when disclosure of some
but not all of the requested records passes the tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedure for requesting a waiver or reduction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A requester must request a waiver or reduction of fees at the same time as the request for records. The requester should
explain why a waiver or reduction is proper under the factors set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
Only the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs may make the decision whether to waive or reduce the fees. If the
Food and Drug Administration does not completely grant the request for a waiver or reduction, the denial letter will
designate a review official. The requester may appeal the denial to that official. The appeal letter should address
reasons for the Associate Commissioner's decision that are set forth in the denial letter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

*&blank;*&blank;* If the affected person fails to intervene to defend the exempt status of the records and to itemize

whether that person has waived such exemption so as to require the Food and Drug Administration to promptly make the
records available for public disclosure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;20.61

which is privileged or confidential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A trade secret may consist of any commercially valuable plan, formula, process, or device that is used for the making,
preparing, compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to be the end product of either innovation
or substantial effort. There must be a direct relationship between the trade secret and the productive process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) A person who submits records to the Government may designate part or all of the information in such records as exempt
from disclosure under exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act. The person may make this designation either at
the time the records are submitted to the Government or within a reasonable time thereafter. The designation must
be in writing. Where a legend is required by a request for proposals or request for quotations, pursuant to 48 CFR 352.215&hyph;12,
then that legend is necessary for this purpose. Any such designation will expire 10 years after the records were submitted
to the Government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The procedures in this paragraph apply to records on which the submitter has designated information as provided
in paragraph (d) of this section. These procedures also apply to records that were submitted to the Food and Drug Administration
when the agency has substantial reason to believe that information in the records could reasonably be considered
exempt under exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act. Certain exceptions to these procedures are set forth in
paragraph (f) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When the Food and Drug Administration receives a request for such records and determines that disclosure may be
required, the Food and Drug Administration will make reasonable efforts to notify the submitter about these facts.
The notice will include a copy of the request, and it will inform the submitter about the procedures and time limits
for submission and consideration of objections to disclosure. If the Food and Drug Administration must notify a large
number of submitters, notification may be done by posting or publishing a notice in a place where the submitters are
reasonably likely to become aware of it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The submitter has 5 working days from receipt of the notice to object to disclosure of any part of the records and
to state all bases for its objections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(3) The Food and Drug Administration will give consideration to all bases that have been stated in a timely manner by
the submitter. If the Food and Drug Administration decides to disclose the records, the Food and Drug Administration
will notify the submitter in writing. This notice will briefly explain why the agency did not sustain the submitter's
objections. The Food and Drug Administration will include with the notice a copy of the records about which the submitter
objected, as the agency proposes to disclose them. The notice will state that the Food and Drug Administration intends
to disclose the records 5 working days after the submitter receives the notice unless a U.S. District Court orders
the agency not to release them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If a requester files suit under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain records covered by this paragraph, the
Food and Drug Administration will promptly notify the submitter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Whenever the Food and Drug Administration sends a notice to a submitter under paragraph (e)(1) of this section,
the Food and Drug Administration will notify the requester that the Food and Drug Administration is giving the submitter
a notice and an opportunity to object. Whenever the Food and Drug Administration sends a notice to a submitter under
paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the Food and Drug Administration will notify the requester of this fact. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The notice requirements in paragraph (e) of this section do not apply in the following situations: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Food and Drug Administration decided not to disclose the records; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The information has previously been published or made generally available; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Disclosure is required by a regulation issued after notice and opportunity for public comment, that specifies
narrow categories of records that are to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, but in this case a submitter
may still designate records as described in paragraph (d) of this section, and in exceptional cases, the Food and Drug
Administration may, at its discretion, follow the notice procedures in paragraph (e) of this section; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The information requested has not been designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure when the submitter
had an opportunity to do so at the time of submission of the information or within a reasonable time thereafter, unless
the Food and Drug Administration has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result
in competitive harm; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The designation appears to be obviously frivolous, but in this case the Food and Drug Administration will still
give the submitter the written notice required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section (although this notice need not
explain our decision or include a copy of the records), and the Food and Drug Administration will notify the requester
as described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.

(1) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(2) Would deprive a person to a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign
agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis; and information
furnished by a confidential source in the case of a record compiled by the Food and Drug Administration or any other
criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national
security intelligence investigation; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions or would disclose
guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, if such disclosure could reasonably be expected
to risk circumvention of the law; or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is revoking a regulation that implements section 403(d) of the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) by defining the circumstances in which a food is misbranded, and that became final
by operation of law on May 10, 1993. In addition, the agency is replacing this revoked regulation with one that was included
in a final rule that published in the

<SUPPLEM>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (the 1990 amendments) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535) became law on November
8, 1990. Section 6 of the 1990 amendments established a procedure under which FDA was given 30 months from the date of
their enactment to promulgate final rules implementing that section. Pursuant to that procedure, FDA published
a proposal on January 6, 1993 (58 FR 2957) (the misleading container proposal), to amend its regulations by implementing
new &sect;100.100 (21 CFR 100.100) to define the circumstances in which a food is misbranded under section 403(d)
of the act (21 U.S.C. 343(d)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6(b)(3)(D)(ii) of the 1990 amendments provides that, if the final rule to implement section 403(d) of the
act is not promulgated within 30 months of the date of passage of the 1990 amendments (November 8, 1990), then the regulation
proposed to implement that section is to be considered a final regulation. Further, section 6 provides that States
and their political subdivisions shall be preempted with respect to section 403(d) of the act at that time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 30-month period established by the 1990 amendments expired on May 9, 1993. Because FDA was unable to publish a final
rule, in the proceeding instituted in January 1993, by May 9, 1993, FDA published a document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of May 12, 1993 (58 FR 27932) (the May 12, 1993, regulation), announcing that the regulation that FDA had proposed in
the misleading container proposal was considered to be a final regulation by operation of law, effective May 10, 1993.
This document did not conclude the rulemaking begun in January, 1993, however. Rather, the May 12, 1993, regulation
was part of a separate proceeding that is compelled under section 6(b)(3)(D)(ii) of the 1990 amendments (see H. Rept.
101&hyph;538, 101st Cong., 2d sess. 18 and 136 Congressional Record 5842 on the effect of this ``hammer'' provision).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64123), FDA published a final rule on the circumstances in which containers are misleading
and thus would misbrand the food under section 403(d) of the act. This final rule concluded the proceeding that the
agency instituted with the misleading container proposal. In the May 12, 1993, document, FDA stated that when it issued
such a final rule, it would act to supersede the regulation that had become final by operation of law. Thus, the agency
proposed to withdraw the May 10, 1993, regulation in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 6, 1993 (58 FR 64208).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA explained that it was proposing to do so for two reasons. First, the May 10, 1993, regulation did not have the benefit
of public comment. Thus, the regulation included in the December 6, 1993, final rule (the December 6, 1993 regulation),
which was the product of notice and comment rulemaking, is better able than the May 10, 1993, regulation to ensure adequate
implementation of section 403(d) of the act and to facilitate compliance. Second, FDA tentatively found that because
of the minor differences between the May 10, 1993, regulation and the December 6, 1993, regulation, replacing the
former with the latter will not result in any hardship to manufacturers who have relied on the May 10, 1993, regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA gave interested persons 10 days to comment on its proposal to withdraw the May 10, 1993, regulation. It also proposed
to make any final rule that issues in this proceeding effective on the date of its publication in order to ensure that
the supersession of the May 10, 1993, regulation proceeded as expeditiously as possible and with a minimum of confusion
or ambiguity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comment period on the proposal to withdraw the May 10, 1993, regulation closed on December 17, 1993. FDA received
no comments on this proposed action. Therefore, FDA advises that the May 10, 1993, regulation, which became final
by operation of law, is withdrawn. FDA advises that it is replacing that regulation with the December 6, 1993, regulation.

Environmental Impact

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the December 6, 1993, proposal (58 FR 64208 at 64209), FDA stated that it had determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(ii)
that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment,
and that as a result, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required. FDA
received no comments on the conclusion; therefore FDA restates it here.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the December 6, 1993, proposal (58 FR 64208 at 64209), FDA incorporated the conclusion from the December 6, 1993,
final rule on slack-fill that the agency's action in replacing the May 10, 1993, regulation would not have any significant
economic effects. The agency received no comments on this conclusion and consequently is restating it here.

Misleading containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 403(d) of the act, a food shall be deemed to be misbranded if its container is so made, formed,
or filled as to be misleading. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A container that does not allow the consumer to fully view its contents shall be considered to be filled as to be misleading
if it contains nonfunctional slack-fill. Slack-fill is the difference between the actual capacity of a container
and the volume of product contained therein. Nonfunctional slack-fill is the empty space in a package that is filled
to less than its capacity for reasons other than:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Protection of the contents of the package;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The requirements of the machines used for enclosing the contents in such package;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Unavoidable product settling during shipping and handling;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The need for the package to perform a specific function (e.g., where packaging plays a role in the preparation or
consumption of a food), where such function is inherent to the nature of the food and is clearly communicated to consumers;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The fact that the product consists of a food packaged in a reusable container where the container is part of the presentation
of the food and has value which is both significant in proportion to the value of the product and independent of its function
to hold the food, e.g., a gift product consisting of a food or foods combined with a container that is intended for further
use after the food is consumed; or durable commemorative or promotional packages; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Inability to increase level of fill or to further reduce the size of the package (e.g., where some minimum package
size is necessary to accommodate required food labeling (excluding any vignettes or other nonmandatory designs
or label information), discourage pilfering, facilitate handling, or accommodate tamper-resistant devices).

The establishment of viticultural areas and the subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of viticultural area names as appellations of origin in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wine labeling and advertising will help consumers better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify the wines they may purchase, and will help

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF&hyph;53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
27 CFR part 4. These regulations allow the establishment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of definite American viticultural areas. The regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used as an appellation of origin in the labeling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advertising of wine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATF&hyph;60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing for the listing of American viticultural areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 4.25a(e)(l), title 27, CFR, defines an American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguishable by geographical features, the boundaries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which have been delineated in subpart C of part 9. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for proposing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American viticultural area. Any interested person may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area. The petition should include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area specified in the petition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the viticultural area are as specified in the petition; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Evidence relating to the geographical characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from surrounding areas; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A description of the specific boundaries of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
viticultural area, based on features which can be found on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
largest applicable scale; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Wisconsin, to establish a viticultural area in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
south-central Wisconsin to be known as ``Lake Wisconsin.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The viticultural area is bounded by the shoreline of Lake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wisconsin and the Wisconsin River on the north and west. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wollersheim Winery is the sole winery located in the 28,000

Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to Mr. Wollersheim's petition, ATF published a notice of proposed rulemaking, Notice No. 781, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on September 24, 1993 (58 FR 49949), proposing the establishment of the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area. The notice
requested comments from all interested persons by October 25, 1993.

Comments to Notice of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seven comments were received concerning the proposal to establish the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area. All seven
commenters stated that they fully support the proposed area as delineated in Notice No. 781. One of the commenters
was under the mistaken impression that this area had been proposed to be called the Roxbury Viticultural District.
However, despite the misunderstanding about the name, this commenter stated in his letter that he heartily supports
the establishment of a new viticultural area in this part of Wisconsin which includes the Wollersheim Winery.

Viticultural Area Name 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The place-name ``Lake Wisconsin'' was first used ca. 1917 to describe a widened section of the Wisconsin River that
was submerged when the Baraboo hydroelectric dam was constructed one mile upriver from the town of Prairie-du-Sac.
A travel brochure and map produced by the Lake Wisconsin Chamber of Commerce in 1989, entitled Lake Wisconsin Chamber
Recreation Area Vacationland, shows various recreational and tourist facilities in the Lake Wisconsin viticultural
area. The viticultural area has a long history of wine grape growing and wine making activity. Agoston Haraszthy,
an immigrant from Hungary well known as an early pioneer in the American wine industry, first planted wine grapes on
Wollersheim Winery property in 1847. Cold winter temperatures frustrated this early attempt to establish grapevines
and two years later Haraszthy moved to California. However, wine grape growing and wine making continued in this area
until 1900. Because of its role in the early history of Wisconsin, Wollersheim Winery and the adjacent homestead were
listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Evidence of Boundaries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The boundaries of the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area are clearly shown on two U.S.G.S. quadrangle maps, Sauk City,
Wisc. and Lodi, Wisc. The Sauk City, Wisc. quadrangle map shows the viticultural area to be bounded by the shoreline
of Lake Wisconsin and the Wisconsin River on the north and west. The southern boundary is defined by Mack Road and State
Highway Y, and the eastern boundary, shown on the Lodi, Wisc. quadrangle map, follows State Highway Y, State Highway
60, State Highway 113, and Spring Creek. The petitioner states that some of the natural boundary features, which closely
approximate some of the roads and highways used as boundaries for this viticultural area, can be found on county maps,
plat maps and county atlases dating back to 1861.

Geographical Features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Wisconsin River (of which Lake Wisconsin is a part) is a major natural feature of the State and of the region. It is
the largest river in the State after the Mississippi River, of which it is a major tributary. Roads and highways define
the southern boundary of the Lake Wisconsin viticultural area. The landscape of the viticultural area is comprised
of discontinuous end moraines interspersed with ground moraines and occasional outwash plains. The landscape outside
the southern boundary is of higher elevation and is comprised of rolling, hummocky upland with some outwash material.
The eastern boundary, which closely approximates Spring Creek, identifies an area of low relief, continuous and
intermittent stream drainage, and marsh. To the east of Spring Creek and outside the viticultural area is a glaciated
upland plain where the landscape is generally of higher elevations and comprised of end moraines with little or no
outwash material.

Topography and Elevation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vineyards in the viticultural area are located at an elevation of 800&hyph;900 feet along south and southwest
facing slopes of 10&hyph;40 percent gradient. This combination of elevation, aspect, and relief contributes to
the well-drained quality of the vineyard soils, the free circulation of air in summer and winter, and the locally longer
growing season. Outside the viticultural area to the north and west, higher elevations of 900&hyph;1,200 feet increase
the risk of wind damage to grapevines, or the soils become too shallow for successful grape cultivation where bedrock
is nearer the surface or exposed. Outside the viticultural area to the east, elevations between 720 feet (Wisconsin
River level) and 800 feet are generally less well drained or are saturated during periods of rainfall or snowmelt.

Climate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Lake Wisconsin viticultural area benefits from the microclimate effects of the lower Wisconsin River valley.
The river moderates winter temperatures in the viticultural area several degrees higher than areas north and west
of the river or further south. Air circulation within the river valley helps prevent cold air accumulation and frost
pockets from forming in the vineyards. In summer, the river valley and limestone bluffs along the river's edge serve
to channel air currents and increase localized air circulation, protecting the vineyards from mildew and rot in hot,
humid weather. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The viticultural area has a mean precipitation of twenty-nine inches, one inch less than the average rainfall in the
area north and east, three inches less than the average rainfall in the area to the west, and two inches less than the
State average. The petitioner describes the viticultural area as an ``island'' of locally below-average rainfall
and drier soils conducive to the grapevines concentrating their vigor in ripening fruit. The viticultural area has
a growing season of 140&hyph;160 days, ten to twenty days longer than across the river to the west and to the north. The
additional frost-free period allows the grapes to reach maturity before the onset of winter cold.

Soil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Wisconsin River forms an approximate dividing line between the glaciated and unglaciated regions of south-central
Wisconsin. Soils primarily of glacial till and outwash material are found east of the river valley and characterize
the soils in the viticultural area. The unglaciated ``driftless'' soils west of the valley result from significant
differences in soil parent materials, microrelief, and drainage. The soils that support viticulture within the
viticultural area are Typic Hapludalfs of mixed mineral material and silty or loamy texture. All are underlain by
gravelly or sandy loam glacial till or by dolomitic bedrock. The soils are typically well drained and about 36&hyph;60
inches deep on slopes and rolling areas of 2&hyph;45 percent gradient. The soils outside the viticultural area to
the north and west are predominately unglaciated, and so are not underlain by glacial till and contain less outwash
material. The soils outside the area to the south and east, although glacially derived, are found on topography of
rolling upland with fewer limestone outcrops and no outwash plains. The soils there have formed on slightly higher
elevations over discontinuous end and ground moraines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local
or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866.

Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is hereby certified that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities. The establishment of a viticultural area is neither an endorsement nor approval by ATF of the quality
of wine produced in the area, but rather an identification of an area that is distinct from surrounding areas. This
process merely allows wineries to more accurately describe the origin of their wines to the consumers, and helps consumers
identify the wines they purchase. Designation of a viticultural area itself has no significant economic impact because
any commercial advantage can come only from consumer acceptance of wines made from grapes grown within the area. In
addition, no new recordkeeping or reporting requirements are imposed. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis
is not required.

The Lake Wisconsin viticultural area is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in Columbia and Dane Counties, Wisconsin. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary is as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The point of beginning is on the ``Lodi, Wisc.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S.G.S. map in the northeast quarter-section of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17, Lodi Township, Columbia County, where Spring Creek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enters Lake Wisconsin; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) From the point of beginning, follow the southern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shoreline of Lake Wisconsin northwest to where Lake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wisconsin narrows and becomes the Wisconsin River on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
map, in the vicinity of the town of Merrimac, Sauk County; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Then continue along the southern shoreline of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wisconsin River, west and south past Goose Egg Hill, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Columbia County, on the ``Sauk City, Wisc.'' quadrangle map, and then west to a southwest bend in the shoreline opposite

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wiegands Bay, Sauk County, where the Wisconsin River 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-half a mile; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Then in a northeasterly direction about 1,000 feet on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State Highway 188, to the intersection of Mack Road; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Then east on Mack Road to the intersection of State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Highway Y, about 3 miles; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Then follow State Highway Y in a generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
northeasterly direction onto the ``Lodi, Wisc.'' quadrangle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
map and continue in a northeasterly direction to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intersection with State Highway 60; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

By letter dated October 6, 1993 (Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;18), Arkansas submitted a proposed amendment
to its plan pursuant to SMCRA. Arkansas submitted the proposed amendment in response to a required program amendment
at 30 CFR 904.26(a) that was placed on the Arkansas plan when OSM approved Arkansas' March 31, 1993, plan amendment
(58 FR 38532, July 19, 1993; Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;17). Arkansas intended that this amendment be in
compliance with section 402 of SMCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arkansas proposed to amend Arkansas Code Annotated (ACA) 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) that provides criteria for
the determination of the eligibility of certain project sites for AML funding. Specifically, Arkansas proposed
to require at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) a finding that the surface coal mining operation occurred during the
period beginning on August 4, 1977, and ending on November 5, 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the November 1, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (58 FR 58313; Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;25) and in the same notice opened the public comment period and
provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the substantive adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment
period closed on December 1, 1993. No substantive comments were received. The public hearing, scheduled for November
26, 1993, was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a thorough review pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 884.14 and 884.15, the Director finds,
as discussed below, that Arkansas' October 6, 1993, proposed plan amendment is in compliance with SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM required at 30 CFR 904.26(a) that Arkansas submit a revision to ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) to limit operations
eligible for AML funds because of insolvency of a surety company to those operations whose surety became insolvent
during the time frame provided by section 402(g)(4)(B)(ii) of SMCRA. Section 402(g)(4)(B)(ii) of SMCRA, as revised
by the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508), provided that the period of time during
which such an operation would be eligible for AML funds because of the insolvency of the surety company would begin
on August 4, 1977, and end on the date of enactment of the revision to SMCRA, which was November 5, 1990. Because Arkansas
revised ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) to specify a period of time beginning on August 4, 1977, and ending on November
5, 1990, ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) is no less stringent than section 402(g)(4)(B)(ii) of SMCRA, as revised
by the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Act of 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Director approves ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(b)(2) and removes the required amendment at 30 CFR 904.26(a).

1. Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment.
No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing
was held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Agency Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 30 CFR 884.14(a)(2) and 884.15(a), the Director solicited comments from the heads of various other Federal
agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Arkansas plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated October 29, 1993, (Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;22), the U.S. Bureau of Mines responded that
it had no comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated October 29, 1993 (Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;23), the U.S. National Park Service (NPS)
responded that the proposed amendment would not impact NPS program responsibilities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated November 8, 1993 (Administrative Record No. AAML&hyph;24), the U.S. Bureau of Land Management responded
with a recommendation that Arkansas be required to revise ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(c) so that it would read as follows:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining which sites to reclaim pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, the Director shall follow the priorities
stated in paragraphs (1) and (2) of 15&hyph;58&hyph;402. The Director shall ensure that priority is given to those
sites which are in the immediate vicinity of a residential area or which have an adverse economic impact upon a community
[once coal mining sites and toxic mining material sites on federal or state surface tracts have been reclaimed].
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
BLM proposed the addition of the bracketed language and stated that its intent was to protect the public interest as
a whole, particularly in the Ouachita National Forest, prior to focusing in on individual communities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Referenced ``paragraph (b) of this section'' in ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401, as revised by the amendment that is the
subject of this notice, allows the reclamation under Arkansas' plan of certain surface coal mining operations that
operated on or after August 7, 1977, and were abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Referenced ``paragraphs (1) and (2) of 15&hyph;58&hyph;402'' require that the expenditure of AML funds reflect
the priorities of (1) the protection of public health, safety, general welfare, and property from extreme danger
of adverse effects of coal mining practices and (2) the protection of public health, safety, and general welfare from
adverse effects of coal mining practices. These State provisions are substantively identical to sections 403(a)
(1) and (2) of SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;401(c) is substantively identical to section 402(g)(4)(C) of SMCRA. In addition, section
411 of SMCRA provides for the use of AML funds for lands affected by noncoal mining only after a State has certified that
all abandoned coal mines have been reclaimed. Arkansas has not yet made this certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM cannot, as requested by BLM, require that Arkansas give higher priority to the reclamation of coal mining sites
and toxic mining material sites on federal or state surface tracts because sections 403(a), 402(g)(4)(C), and 411
of SMCRA do not do so.

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above finding, the Director approves Arkansas' proposed plan amendment, as submitted on October 6, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 904, codifying decisions concerning the Arkansas plan, are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State plan amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their plans into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay.
Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State abandoned mine land reclamation plans
and revisions thereof since each such plan is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Decisions on
proposed State AML reclamation plans and revisions thereof submitted by a State are based on a determination of whether
the submittal meets the requirements of Title IV of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1231&hyph;1243) and the applicable Federal regulations
at 30 CFR parts 884 and 888.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since agency decisions on proposed State abandoned mine
land reclamation plans and revisions thereof are categorically excluded from compliance with the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332) by the Manual of the Department of the Interior (516 DM 6, appendix 8, paragraph 8.4B(29)).

5. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon Federal regulations for which an economic analysis
was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial
number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements established by SMCRA or
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule
would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions in the analyses for
the corresponding Federal regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On November 20, 1990, the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 published the Environmental Protection Agency's (the Agency's) revision of the National Emission Standards for
Hazardous Air Pollutants for Asbestos (asbestos NESHAP), 40 CFR part 61, subpart M, 55 FR 48406. The asbestos NESHAP
applies to any facility as defined in 40 CFR 61.141. The Agency has learned that some of the regulated community have
questions concerning the analysis of samples which may contain multiple layers, any or all of which may be asbestos
containing materials (ACM) under the asbestos NESHAP. Because these questions are frequently asked, EPA is making
this clarification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This clarification does not supersede, alter, or in any way replace the existing asbestos NESHAP. This notice is intended
solely as guidance and does not represent an action subject to judicial review under the section 307(b) of the Clean
Air Act or section 704 of the Administrative Procedure Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Clarification of Multi-layered ACM System
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Environmental Protection Agency has received many questions about analyzing multi-layered systems for asbestos
content to determine the applicability of the asbestos NESHAP. This clarification reiterates EPA's position for
analysis of multi-layered samples for applicability of the asbestos NESHAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, when a sample consists of two or more distinct layers or materials, each layer should be treated separately
and the results reported by layer (discrete stratum). Specific examples are given below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Plaster/Stucco Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If plaster and stucco wall or ceiling systems are layered, and the layers can be distinguished, then the layers must
be analyzed separately. Where a plaster or stucco wall system is constructed in layers, and the asbestos-containing
layer becomes a distinguishable but ``non-separable'' component of the wall system, the results of the analysis
of the individual layer(s) may include a small amount of the other layers when analyzed (e.g. a skim coat layer may contain
a small amount of the base coat layer in the analysis of the skim coat layer).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Add-on Materials
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All materials ``added'' to wallboard or other base materials (e.g., sprayed-on materials, paint, ceiling or wall
texture, etc.) must be analyzed separately, if possible. The results of the analysis of those individual layers of
``add-on'' material may not be averaged with the result of the analysis of wallboard for a composite result, but must
be analyzed and reported separately. Where a thin coating of one material is applied over another material and the
materials cannot be separated without compromising the layers, the analysis may include a small amount of the base
layer. If for example, a paint layer containing asbestos is spread over a wallboard layer, and the paint layer cannot
be separated from the wallboard, then a small amount of the wallboard layer may be included in the sample of the paint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If any of the ``add-on'' materials meet the definition of regulated asbestos-containing material (as defined in
40 CFR 61.141), and if at least 160 square feet of the material(s) are involved in demolition or renovation (whether
planned or unplanned during a calendar year), then the project would be subject to the asbestos NESHAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Joint Compound/Wallboard
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When joint compound and/or tape is applied to wallboard it becomes an integral part of the wallboard and in effect becomes
one material forming a wall system. Therefore, where a demolition or renovation impacts such a wall system, a composite
analysis of the wall system (percent of asbestos in the joint compound, tape and wallboard) should be conducted. If
the analysis shows an asbestos content of greater than one percent and at least 160 square feet of the wall system is
involved in the demolition or renovation activities (whether planned or unplanned, during a calendar year), then
the activities would be subject to the asbestos NESHAP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. On May 11, 1993, final rules were adopted that established call sign administrators for club and military recreation
stations in the amateur service. Subsequently, a petition for reconsideration was filed in which it was argued that
the establishment of such administrators was not minor and non-controversial and that a notice and comment proceeding
should have been held before final rules were adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Further, the Commission is activating a new automated licensing system that will enable it to perform, with minimal
burden, the function that administrators in the private sector were going to perform without reimbursement. Also,
a new proposal by the Commission regarding call signs will meet the need of persons interested in obtaining a club station
license.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Because there appears to be merit in the argument that the establishment of administrators is controversial, and
because the new proposal will meet the need of persons interested in the club station licenses, the rule provisions
that established private entity club call sign administrators can be vacated.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Chapter Ten of NAFTA requires the three NAFTA countries (the United States, Canada, and Mexico) to eliminate ``buy
national'' restrictions on non-defense related purchases, by their responsible Federal Governments, of goods
and services provided by firms in North America. NAFTA applies to most United States Government agencies. The Canadian
Free Trade Agreement is suspended while NAFTA remains in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by NAFTA, specified agencies must evaluate certain NAFTA country end products offers without regard
to the restrictions of the Buy American Act or the Balance of Payments Program. This evaluation method will apply to
offers of Canadian end products under supply contracts with an estimated value above $25,000 and Mexican end products
under supply contracts with an estimated value of $50,000 or more, except for the Department of Energy's Power Marketing
Administrations, where the estimated acquisition value is $250,000 or more. This evaluation method also will apply
to construction contracts with an estimated acquisition value of $6,500,000 or more, except for the Department of
Energy's Power Marketing Administration, where the estimated acquisition value is $8,000,000 or more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicable rule of origin for NAFTA country end products under the agreement is that of ``substantial transformation'',
which means an article that is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a NAFTA country or has been substantially
transformed in a NAFTA country into a new and different article may be offered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule also_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Designates NAFTA country end products as eligible products under the Trade Agreements Act, as implemented in
Trade Agreements under the FAR;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Adds language to require that, when an overseas procurement for performance overseas is subject to NAFTA, it will
be synopsized in accordance with agency procedures;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Revises the prescriptions for the provisions, Submission of Offers in the English Language, and Submission of
Offers in U.S. Currency, to clarify and include NAFTA;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Updates the list of designated countries in FAR 25.401 to add ``Portugal'' and revise ``Upper Volta'' to ``Burkina
Faso'';
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Includes the new threshold of $182,000 for application of the Trade Agreements Act and the European Community
(EC) Agreement, which is effective January 1, 1994;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Updates FAR 25.407 list of agencies covered by the Agreements on EC and NAFTA; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Makes clarifications to the interim rule published in FAC 90&hyph;18 (58 FR 31140), at FAR 25.407, to implement
the Memorandum of Understanding between the United States of America and the European Economic Community on Government
Procurement and NAFTA.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The interim rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because the rule waives the Buy American Act for certain Mexican and Canadian products. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis (IRFA) has been prepared and will be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy for the Small Business Administration.
A copy of the IRFA may be obtained from the FAR Secretariat. Comments are invited. Comments from small entities concerning
the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately
and cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (FAR Case 93&hyph;310), in correspondence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) is deemed to apply because the new provision at 52.225&hyph;20
requires offerors to list the line item number and country of origin for any end product other than a domestic end product.
Accordingly, a request for clearance of a new information collection requirement concerning the NAFTA Act is being
submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Public comments concerning this requirement are invited through an OMB clearance request appearing in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 at 58 FR 68636, December 28, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Determination To Issue an Interim Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense (DOD), the Administrator of General
Services (GSA), and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that compelling
reasons exist to promulgate this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. This action is necessary
because the NAFTA Implementation Act, signed into law on December 8, 1993, becomes effective on January 1, 1994. However,
pursuant to Public Law 98&hyph;577 and Federal Acquisition Regulation 1.501, public comments received in response
to this interim rule will be considered in formulating the final rule.

the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057) and the

(2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of materials from another country or instrumentality,

or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was transformed. The term includes services (except
transportation services) incidental to its supply; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

otherwise specified, the Acts apply to all items in the schedule. The Contractor agrees to deliver under this contract
only domestic end products unless, in its offer, it specifies delivery of foreign end products in the provision entitled
``Buy American Act_Trade Agreements_Balance of Payments Program Certificate.'' An offer certifying that a designated,
NAFTA, or Caribbean Basin country end product will be supplied requires the Contractor to supply a designated, NAFTA,
or Caribbean Basin country end product or, at the Contractor's option, a domestic end product. Contractors may not
supply a foreign end product for line items subject to the Trade Agreements Act unless the foreign end product is a designated,
NAFTA, or Caribbean end product (see FAR 25.401), or unless a waiver is granted under section 302 of the Trade Agreements
Act of 1979 (see FAR 25.402(c)).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as a participant in the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program, is issuing
interim regulations to govern the referral of delinquent debts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for offset against
the income tax refunds of persons owing money to EPA. These regulations allow EPA to collect debts by means of offset
from the income tax refunds of persons owing money to EPA provided certain conditions are met. This rule establishes
procedures to be followed by EPA in requesting the IRS to offset tax refunds due to taxpayers who have past-due legally
enforceable debt obligations to the EPA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This interim rule provides procedures for EPA to refer past-due legally enforceable debts to the IRS for offset against
the income tax refunds of persons owing debts to EPA. This rule is authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3720A, the purpose of which
is to improve the ability of the government to collect money owed it while adding certain notice requirements and other
protections applicable to the government's relationship to the debtor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule implements 31 U.S.C. 3720A, which directs any Federal agency that is owed a past-due legally enforceable
debt by a named person to notify the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance with regulations issued by the Department
of the Treasury at 26 CFR 301.6402&hyph;6. Before a Federal agency may give such notice, however, it must first: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Notify the debtor that the agency proposes to refer the debt for a tax refund deduction; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Give the debtor 60 days from the date of the notification to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due
or legally enforceable; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consider any evidence presented by the debtor and determine whether any amount of such debt is past-due and legally
enforceable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Satisfy such other conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe to ensure that the agency's determination
is valid and that the agency has made reasonable efforts to obtain payment of the debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule, in accordance with IRS regulations, provides that before EPA refers a debt to Treasury (through IRS), a
notice of intention (Notice of Intent) will be sent to the debtor. This Notice of Intent will inform the debtor of the
amount of the debt and that unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of EPA's Notice of Intent, EPA intends
to collect the debt by requesting the IRS to offset any tax refund payable to the debtor. In addition, the Notice of Intent
will state that the debtor has a right, during such period, to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due
or legally enforceable. This rule also establishes procedures for the debtor to present such evidence.

Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of
the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule
that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local,
or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken
or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan
programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out
of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order
12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.

Public Comments

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to an agreement between the IRS, the Financial Management Service, and EPA regarding EPA's participation
in the Tax Refund Offset Program for 1994, EPA is required to have promulgated regulations regarding referral of debts
to IRS for tax refund offset prior to EPA's participation in the program. EPA is issuing interim final regulations
to take effect today in order to fulfill that requirement. Although EPA will respond to written comments on today's
notice, EPA is not holding a hearing, providing an opportunity for prior comments, or delaying the effective date
because this regulation is mostly procedural and because there are no significant issues of law or fact or relevant
substantial impacts on the Nation or large numbers of persons of which EPA could take account consistent with law.
Moreover, issuance of immediately effective interim final regulations does not prejudice the due process rights
of debtors and is essential in order for EPA to participate in the 1994 program. Written comments are solicited for
60 days after publication of this document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. A final document discussing any comments received and revisions required will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This subpart establishes procedures for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to refer past-due debts to the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for offset against the income tax refunds of persons owing debts to EPA. It specifies
the Agency procedures and the rights of the debtor applicable to claims for the payment of debts owed to EPA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicability and scope. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This subpart implements 31 U.S.C. 3720A, which authorizes the IRS to reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past-due
legally enforceable debt owed to the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) For purposes of this section, a past-due legally enforceable debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to
the United States and: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent for at least three months but has not been delinquent for
more than ten years at the time the offset is made; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) or cannot be
collected by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by the Agency against amounts payable to or on behalf of
the debtor by or on behalf of the Agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) With respect to which EPA has given the taxpayer at least 60 days from the date of notification to present evidence
that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable, has considered evidence presented by such taxpayer,
if any, and has determined that an amount of such debt is past-due and legally enforceable; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Has been disclosed by EPA to a consumer reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), unless a consumer reporting
agency would be prohibited from using such information by 15 U.S.C. 1681c, or unless the amount of the debt does not
exceed $100.00; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) With respect to which EPA has notified or has made a reasonable attempt to notify the taxpayer that the debt is past-due
and, unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, the debt will be referred to the IRS for offset against any overpayment
of tax; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Is at least $25.00; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Department of the Treasury regulations at 26 CFR 301.6402&hyph;6
relating to the eligibility of a debt for tax return offset have been satisfied.

Administrative charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with &sect;13.11, all administrative charges incurred in connection with the referral of a debt to
the IRS shall be assessed on the debt and thus increase the amount of the offset.

Notice requirement before offset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A request for reduction of an IRS tax refund will be made only after EPA makes a determination that an amount is owed and
past-due and provides the debtor with 60 days written notice. EPA's notice of intention to collect by IRS tax refund
offset (Notice of Intent) will state: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The amount of the debt; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of EPA's Notice of Intent, EPA intends to collect the debt
by requesting the IRS to reduce any amounts payable to the debtor as refunds of Federal taxes paid by an amount equal
to the amount of the debt and all accumulated interest and other charges; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) That the debtor has a right to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) A mailing address for forwarding any written correspondence and a contact name and phone number for any questions.

Notification by debtor. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A debtor who receives a Notice of Intent has the right to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due
or not legally enforceable. To exercise this right, the debtor must: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Send a written request for a review of the evidence to the address provided in the notice;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) State in the request the amount disputed and the reasons why the debtor believes that the debt is not past-due or
is not legally enforceable; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Include in the request any documents which the debtor wishes to be considered or state that additional information
will be submitted within the remainder of the 60-day period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Submission of evidence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The debtor may submit evidence showing that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable along
with the notification required by paragraph (a) of this section. Failure to submit the notification and evidence
within 60 days will result in an automatic referral of the debt to the IRS without further action by EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Review of the evidence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA will consider all available evidence related to the debt. Within 30 days, if feasible, EPA will notify the debtor
whether EPA has sustained, amended, or cancelled its determination that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Following review of the evidence, EPA will issue a written decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If EPA either sustains or amends its determination, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall notify the debtor of its intent to refer the debt to the IRS for offset against the debtor's Federal income tax
refund. If EPA cancels its original determination, the debt will not be referred to IRS.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is proposing to amend the Federal meat inspection regulations to permit
the use of sodium citrate in solution to denude beef stomachs of mucous membranes. In 1990, a manufacturer of processing
aids and other direct food ingredients petitioned the Food and Drug Administration and FSIS to approve the use of several
compounds, including sodium citrate, for use in denuding tripe. FSIS has reviewed the data and other information
submitted by the petitioner and has determined that the proposed use of sodium citrate would not result in product
adulteration or misbranding. The proposed regulation would make available to meat processors an additional, alternative
tripe-denuding formulation that would contain sodium citrate as an ingredient. The sodium citrate solution would
be as effective as existing tripe-denuding agents, but would be less objectionable to workers than the agents now
in use. The sodium citrate-containing formulation would contribute to improved tripe production.

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule is in conformance with Executive Order 12866, and the Assistant Secretary has determined that
it is not a ``significant regulatory action.'' This proposed rule: (1) Would have an effect on the economy of less than
$100 million; (2) would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity,
competition, jobs, the environment, public health and safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities;
(3) would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
(4) would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights or obligations
or recipients thereof; and (5) would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.

Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. States and local jurisdictions
are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing
requirements with respect to premises, facilities, and operations of federally inspected meat or poultry products,
and any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected meat and poultry products
that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA and PPIA. States and local jurisdictions may,
however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction over meat and poultry products that are outside official establishments
for the purpose of preventing the distribution of meat and poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under
the FMIA or PPIA, or in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into
the United States. The States may, however, impose more stringent requirements on such State inspected products
and establishments.

This proposed rule is not intended to have retroactive effect, and no applicable administrative procedures must
be exhausted before any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. However, the applicable administrative
procedures specified in 9 CFR 306.5 must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the application of the provisions
of this rule, if the challenge involves any decision of an inspector relating to inspection services provided under
the FMIA. The applicable administrative procedures specified in 9 CFR part 335 must be exhausted prior to any judicial
challenge to the application of the provisions of this rule with respect to labeling decisions.

Effect on Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Administrator has determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601). The proposed regulation would make
available to meat processors an additional, alternative tripe-denuding formulation that would contain sodium
citrate as an ingredient. The sodium citrate formulation could be manufactured and sold in liquid form and used in
existing or newly developed tripe denuding equipment. The sodium citrate-containing formulation could be used
most efficiently in the new equipment and contribute to improved tripe production. Small establishments could benefit
from the use of the sodium citrate product.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), FSIS provides for mandatory inspection of meat and meat food products shipped in interstate and foreign commerce.
The Act prohibits the addition of any substance to any meat or meat food product that may render the product adulterated
(21 U.S.C. 601). Section 318.7(a)(1) of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 318.7) prohibits the use of
any substance in the preparation of any product unless its use is approved in &sect;318.7(c)(4) of the Federal meat
inspection regulations (9 CFR 318.7), which is the chart of substances acceptable for use in the preparation of products,
or unless it is approved elsewhere in the regulations or it is approved by the Administrator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1990, a manufacturer of processing aids and other direct food ingredients petitioned the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and FSIS to approve the use of several compounds, including sodium citrate, for use in denuding tripe. Tripe
denudation_the removal of mucous membranes from beef stomachs_is a necessary step in the cleaning and preparation
of tripe for use as human food. FSIS has reviewed the data and other information submitted by the petitioner and has
determined that the proposed use of sodium citrate would not result in product adulteration or misbranding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA lists sodium citrate as generally recognized as safe when used in accordance with good manufacturing practice
in an amount not in excess of that required to achieve its intended effect (21 CFR 182.1751). In an August 24, 1992, letter
to the petitioner, FDA reported this fact and stated that it would have ``no objection to [sodium citrate's] addition
to the tripe-denuding mixture [contemplated by the petitioner] providing that it is used in accordance with good
manufacturing practice.''

FSIS is proposing to amend &sect;318.7(c)(4) of the Federal meat inspection regulations to permit the use of sodium
citrate as a tripe denuding agent in combination with other approved agents, in an amount sufficient to accomplish
the intended effect. Use of sodium citrate for this purpose would be subject to the condition that the substance be
removed from the denuded tripe by rinsing with potable water.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is proposing to amend the poultry products inspection regulations to permit the application of trisodium phosphate
(TSP) on raw, chilled poultry carcasses passed for wholesomeness. TSP would be permitted as an antimicrobial agent
on such poultry carcasses at a level of 8 to 12 percent. The TSP treatment solution would be maintained at a temperature
of 45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F. to 55
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F. and applied by spraying or dipping carcasses for up to 15 seconds. Tests conducted by industry have shown that
the use of TSP at a level of 8 to 12 percent reduces microbial populations on raw, chilled poultry surfaces. This proposed
rule is in response to a petition filed by Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., Cranbury, New Jersey.

FSIS has determined that this regulatory action is not a significant rule under Executive Order 12866. It would not
likely result in a rule that may (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in
a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health
or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise
interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements,
grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or
policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive
Order.

States and local jurisdictions are preempted under the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing any
requirements with respect to federally inspected premises and facilities, and operations of such establishments,
that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the PPIA. States and local jurisdictions are also preempted
under the PPIA from imposing any marking, labeling, packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected
poultry products that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the PPIA. States and local jurisdictions
may, however, exercise concurrent jurisdiction over poultry products that are outside official establishments
for the purpose of preventing the distribution of poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under the PPIA
or, in the case of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the United States.
States and local jurisdictions may also make requirements or take other actions that are consistent with the PPIA,
with respect to any other matters regulated under the PPIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the PPIA, States that maintain poultry inspection programs must impose requirements on State-inspected products
and establishments that are at least equal to those required under the PPIA. These States may, however, impose more
stringent requirements on such State-inspected products and establishments.

Effect on Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Administrator, FSIS, has determined that the proposed rule would not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. The proposed rule would permit the use of TSP at the establishment's option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Establishments that decide to use TSP as an antimicrobial agent on their products would incur a one-time expense for
the necessary equipment and an ongoing cost for purchasing TSP. The cost for the treatment equipment would be approximately
$45,000 per processing line. The cost for the TSP would average about 1/2 cent per bird.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The production of ready-to-cook poultry containing lower amounts of bacteria than such poultry now available would
contribute to the national effort to reduce the incidence of pathogenic bacteria in foods. Most consumers are willing
to pay more for poultry products that are raised or processed in a way that reduces the levels of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Salmonella 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on such products.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Therefore, the market for TSP-treated poultry carcasses would likely attract most consumers who desire additional
protection from harmful microorganisms. In turn, poultry establishments that market TSP-treated poultry carcasses
could benefit from increased sales.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FSIS is responsible for assuring that poultry products distributed in commerce are wholesome, not adulterated,
and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Under the PPIA (21 U.S.C. 451&hyph;470), FSIS provides mandatory inspection
of poultry and poultry products shipped in interstate and foreign commerce, as well as in designated States. Continuous
inspection of poultry slaughtering establishments is intended to assure that fresh, ready-to-cook poultry carcasses
and parts are free of visible signs of disease and contamination. FSIS inspectors examine the outside, inside, and
viscera of all birds presented for inspection.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because raw poultry furnish a rich medium for the potential growth of both beneficial and harmful microorganisms,
it has been assumed traditionally that a certain level of microbial activity on the surface tissues of raw poultry
was unavoidable. Consequently, poultry slaughter inspection activities have focused on the organoleptic detection
of poultry diseases or other abnormalities in carcasses and parts that would render the products adulterated or unwholesome.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the years, scientific and public concern about microbiological contamination of poultry products has expanded
from the processing of such products to conditions under which poultry are slaughtered, and even to preslaughter
poultry production. FSIS has encouraged the scientific community and the regulated industry to develop slaughtering
and processing methods and treatments that would yield raw poultry products that are as free as practicable of pathogenic
bacteria. The control of miscrooganisms on raw poultry has been given a high priority on FSIS's research agenda. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Researchers estimate that from 6.5 million to 33 million Americans, or 3 to 14 percent of the population, become ill
each year from consumption of foods containing microorganisms. An estimated 9,000 of these illnesses result in death,
or 4 in 100,000 people. Chapter 4 of a 1985 report by the National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences, Meat
and Poultry Inspection: The Scientific Basis of the Nation's Program, recommended, in part, that the poultry inspection
program be refocused to place greater emphasis on microbiological and chemical testing.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Since the issuance of that report, FSIS has given greater priority to microbiological and chemical testing.

The petitioner supplied data demonstrating that the use of TSP, under the parameters addressed above, is effective
in reducing the levels of bacteria, including pathogenic bacteria, found on raw, chilled poultry carcasses. Immediately
after chilling, poultry carcasses that have been passed for wholesomeness enter the TSP treatment system. Chilled
poultry carcasses are either sprayed with or dipped in the TSP treatment solution for no more than 15 seconds. The concentration
of TSP used in various studies conducted by or for the petitioner ranged from 8 to 12 percent in water, at temperatures
ranging from 45
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F. to 55
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data from the petitioner included results of studies conducted by the Pennsylvania State Sensory Laboratory for
Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., on consumer acceptability of cooked poultry derived from TSP-treated poultry carcasses.
These studies show no significant difference in taste or appearance between cooked poultry from TSP-treated poultry
carcasses and cooked poultry from untreated poultry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner also provided study results concerning moisture pickup and residue findings in poultry carcasses
treated with TSP. According to these study results, the moisture pickup in TSP-treated poultry carcasses does not
exceed regulatory limits for moisture absorption as prescribed in 9 CFR 381.66(d)(5). Residue findings ranged from
^0.25 percent to 0.11 percent, showing that virtually no residue of the TSP solution remains on or in the treated poultry
carcasses.

FSIS also conducted studies to determine the efficacy of TSP on raw, chilled poultry carcasses.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 These studies show that the use of TSP on raw, chilled poultry carcasses results in statistically significant reductions
in the levels of bacteria. Summary statistics of bacterial plate counts were used in all statistical analyses based
on the arithmetic average and statistical significance was determined through nonparametric procedures using
the relative rank of values. Analyses of 256 carcass-rinse samples collected at a federally inspected establishment
over 4 days indicated that carcasses had average aerobe plate counts of 328 before TSP application, and 78 after application;
Enterobacteriaceae counts of 25.5 before TSP application, and 2.7 after application; and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Escherichia coli 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
counts of 10.1 before TSP application, and 0.2 after treatment. Although these particular studies found no salmonellae
in untreated or treated carcasses, preliminary results from industry group testing show that TSP is also effective
in reducing salmonellae on raw poultry. Studies on moisture absorption resulting from the use of TSP found no inconsistencies
with data furnished by the petitioner.

TSP is listed in the Food and Drug Administrated (FDA) regulations as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for multiple
purpose use in accordance with good manufacturing practice (21 CFR 182.1778).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA evaluated the petitioner's request for the use of TSP as a processing aid in poultry and concluded that the treatment
leaves no residues on the product that could be harmful to consumers. Therefore, in an August 25, 1992, letter, FDA
approved the use of TSP as a processing aid on raw poultry, under conditions to be established by FSIS.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrator has determined that (1) the use of TSP on raw, chilled poultry carcasses is in compliance with applicable
FDA requirements, (2) its use is functional and suitable for the intended purpose, (3) the substance is used at the
lowest acceptable level to consistently achieve the desired reduction of pathogenic bacteria as determined in specific
cases, and (4) the use of this substance on raw, chilled poultry carcasses at the stated level will not render the treated
product adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise not in accordance with the requirements of the PPIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FSIS is proposing to amend the poultry products inspection regulations at 9 CFR 381.147(f)(4) to add antimicrobial
agents as a new class of substance for use on poultry products, and to add TSP as an approved antimicrobial agent. As
requested by the petitioner, TSP would be permitted for use on raw, chilled poultry carcasses passed for wholesomeness
at a level of 8 to 12 percent. The TSP treatment solution would be maintained at 45 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. to 55 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F., and would be applied either by spraying or dipping the raw, chilled poultry carcasses for no more than 15 seconds.
FSIS has determined, through review of the petitioner's data and its own study results, that 15 seconds is the maximum
time necessary to coat all surfaces of the poultry carcasses with the TSP solution. FSIS is proposing the application
of TSP by spraying, as well as by dipping, to permit the use of any existing spraying equipment in establishments, and
thus reduce the costs incurred by establishments to set up the TSP treatment system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the use of TSP would not eliminate the need for continuing careful handling of raw poultry products, TSP treatment
on raw, chilled poultry carcasses would reduce the levels of bacteria that may be present on raw poultry carcasses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TSP leaves virtually no residue on or in the carcass of treated poultry that would require the labels of such treated
product to show the presence of TSP. Therefore, poultry producers opting to use TSP would not be required to revise
their product labels.

Description of Rulechange Sought: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
To require all parachute training be performed in accordance with the United States Parachute Association (USPA)
training program or in accordance with a plan approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); incorporated
by reference the USPA training program in part 105; and require that the operator of an aircraft immediately, and by
the most expeditions means available, notify the nearest FAA Air Traffic Facility when a sport parachute accident/incident
occurs involving a person who made an intentional jump from that aircraft.

Petitioner's Reason for the Request:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
 The petitioner feels that this amendment is needed to protect the citizens of the United States of America, who wish
to participate in sport parachuting, by providing participants the assurance of a training course which adheres
to approved specifications; and, in the event of a parachute accident, the proposed changes would facilitate prompt
notification of the nearest FAA field office, enabling timely investigative procedures.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Rotorcraft Directorate, has recently completed a series of harmonization
meetings with the Helicopter Airworthiness Study Group (HASG) of the European Joint Airworthiness Authorities
(JAA). The meetings were supplemented with joint authorities and industry meetings. These meetings resulted in
the issuance of European Joint Airworthiness Requirements 27 (September 1993) and 29 (November 1993), which are
in basic harmonization with Federal Aviation Regulations parts 27 and 29 (FAR 27 and 29). Current rulemaking using
the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) is intended to amend FAR 27 and 29 to complete the harmonization
process for existing rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To assure future rotorcraft rulemaking is harmonized to the greatest extent practical and to provide information
on rulemaking using the ARAC, the FAA believes that a public meeting is warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public meeting will also be used to discuss draft revisions for Advisory Circular (AC) 27&hyph;1, Change 3, and
AC 29&hyph;2A, Change 2 (58 FR 67893, December 22, 1993).

Normal Category Maximum Gross Weight of 6,000 Pounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1956 the FAA has based the primary and obvious distinction between normal and transport category rotorcraft
certification requirements on the maximum certificated gross weight of the aircraft. The upper gross weight limit
for normal category rotorcraft was set at 6,000 pounds, based on existing and anticipated designs. All rotorcraft
above the 6,000 pounds maximum certificated gross weight are required to be certificated in the transport category.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recently the FAA received two requests for exemptions from this criteria and numerous recommendations for varying
degrees of changes to the airworthiness standards. The FAA recognizes that helicopters, and their operational roles,
have evolved since the 6,000-pound rule was established in 1956, and therefore some changes may be warranted. Based
on this recognition, the FAA developed an issue paper entitled ``Certification Categories for Civil Rotorcraft.''
This paper will be used to facilitate discussion at the public meeting. Copies of the paper have been mailed to interested
parties. Additional interested parties who have not received a copy of the paper by January 1, 1994, may obtain a copy
by contacting the person listed under

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Bell Helicopter
Textron, Inc. Model 205A, 205A&hyph;1, 205B, 212, and 412 series helicopters. This proposal would require removal
and replacement of a certain design main transmission lower planetary spider (spider) and would establish a 2,500
hours' time-in-service retirement life for the spider. This proposal is prompted by five failures of the spider that
occurred during the manufacturer's fatigue tests. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent
fatigue failure of the spider, failure of the main transmission, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron,
Inc. (BHTI) Model 205A, 205A&hyph;1, 205B, 212, and 412 series helicopters, equipped with a main transmission lower
planetary spider (spider), part number (P/N) 412&hyph;040&hyph;785&hyph;101. During recent BHTI fatigue tests,
five spiders failed due to structural fatigue. Previously, there was no retirement life established for the spider.
However, based on these test results, the FAA proposes to establish a 2,500 hours' time-in-service (TIS) retirement
life for this design spider. This condition, if not corrected, could result in fatigue failure of the spider, failure
of the main transmission, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved (1) BHTI Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) 205&hyph;93&hyph;54, dated June 18, 1993,
applicable to Model 205A&hyph;1 helicopters; (2) ASB 205B&hyph;93&hyph;16, dated June 18, 1993, applicable to
Model 205B helicopters; (3) ASB 212&hyph;93&hyph;83, dated June 18, 1993, applicable to Model 212 helicopters;
and (4) ASB 412&hyph;93&hyph;72, Revision A, dated June 18, 1993, applicable to Model 412 helicopters. These ASBs
describe procedures for the removal, retirement, and replacement of certain spiders when they reach 2,500 hours'
TIS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require removal and replacement of spiders with less than 2,400 hours' TIS, prior to
or upon attaining 2,500 hours' TIS or, for spiders with 2,400 hours' or more TIS, within the next 100 hours' TIS. This
AD also establishes a retirement life of 2,500 hours' TIS. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 40 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
26 workhours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per workhour.
Required parts would cost approximately $8,929 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $414,360. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron,
Inc. Model 214B, 214B&hyph;1, and 214ST helicopters. This proposal would establish a mandatory retirement life
of 60,000 high-power events for the main rotor trunnion (trunnion), which is currently not a life-limited part. This
proposal is prompted by the manufacturer's analysis and retesting that has shown that the trunnion is sensitive to
high-power events. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent fatigue failure of the trunnion,
that could result in loss of the main rotor and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Bell Helicopter Textron,
Inc. Model 214B, 214B&hyph;1, and 214ST helicopters. Recent retesting and analysis has shown that the main rotor
trunnion (trunnion), part number 214&hyph;010&hyph;230&hyph;101, is sensitive to high-power events. High power
events are takeoffs and external load lifts. This condition, if not corrected, could result in fatigue failure of
the trunnion, loss of the main rotor, and subsequent loss of the control of the helicopter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type
design, the proposed AD would require for the trunnion, within the next 25 hours' time-in-service after the effective
date of this AD, (1) creation of a component history card; (2) accumulation of the historical high-power events; and
(3) thereafter, recording of the high-power events as they occur. Additionally, the proposed AD would establish
a trunnion retirement life of 60,000 high-power events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 15 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
16 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour.
Required parts would cost approximately $10,929 per helicopter. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of
the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $29,523, assuming inspection and modification of one-sixth of
the fleet is required each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To prevent fatigue failure of the trunnion as a result of takeoffs and external loads lifts (high-power events), that
could result in loss of the main rotor and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Within the next 25 hours' time-in-service after the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), accomplish
the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Create a historical service record or component history card for the trunnion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Determine the actual time-in-service of the trunnion from maintenance records, if possible. If the actual time-in-service
cannot be determined, use a time-in-service of 900 hours per year. Prorate the hours for a partial year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For Model 214B and 214B&hyph;1 helicopters, determine and record the accumulated high-power events on the trunnion
as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the number of high-power events is unknown, assign 12 high-power events for each hour time-in-service obtained
in accordance with paragraph (a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the number of high-power events is known, divide that number by 2 and record the resulting number as the total
accumulated high-power events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) For Model 214ST helicopters, determine and record the accumulated high-power events on the trunnion as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) If the number of events is unknown, assign 11 high-power events for each hour time-in-service obtained in accordance
with paragraph (a)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the number of high-power events is known, record that number as the total accumulated high-power events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) After the effective date of this AD, continue to record high-power events in the aircraft maintenance record.
For Model 214B and 214B&hyph;1 helicopters, divide the number of high-power events by 2 and add the resulting number
to the previously recorded sum. For Model 214ST helicopters, add the high-power events to the previously recorded
sum. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Remove the trunnion and replace it with an airworthy trunnion in accordance with the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For each trunnion with 59,400 or more high-power events on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the
trunnion on or before the accumulation of an additional 600 high-power events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For each trunnion with less than 59,400 high-power events on the effective date of this AD, remove and replace the
trunnion on or before attaining 60,000 high-power events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) This AD revises the helicopter Airworthiness Limitations Section of the maintenance manual by establishing
a new retirement life for the trunnion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This action proposes to authorize the use of vanity call signs in the amateur service. The proposed rules are necessary
so that amateur operators can request specific call signs with letters that signify something of importance to them
such as their initials or their nicknames. This proposal would give better service to members of the amateur community
because it would allow them to choose their own calls signs provided the call sign chosen is unassigned and within the
framework of the license class held.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This is a summary of the Commission's Notice of Proposed Rule Making, adopted December 13, 1993, and released December
29, 1993. The complete text of this Commission action, including the proposed rule amendments, is available for inspection
and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference center (room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC.
The complete text of this Notice of Proposed Rule Making, including the proposed rule amendments, may also be purchased

Summary of Notice of Proposed Rule Making
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Licensing Division of the Private Radio Bureau is installing a new automated licensing process that will give
it the capability to administer a vanity call sign system. The Commission, therefore, on its own motion, is proposing
to amend the amateur service rules to implement a system wherein amateur station licensees can select call signs of
their own choice, provided they are not already assigned and are within the framework of the operator license class
held by the applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The vanity call sign system would be in addition to the current sequential call sign system that would be continued
to be used for those applicants who do not want a vanity call sign.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed rules would allow the licensee of an existing primary station to request a modification of the licensee
to show a call sign selected by the licensee. This privilege would also be extended to the license trustee of an existing
club station.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. It is also proposed to administer a club and military recreation station sequential call sign system under our new
automated licensing process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. An applicant could list ten call signs on the application form in order of preference. The first available call sign
from the applicant's list would be assigned. If none of the call signs listed are available, the automated process
would reassign the call sign that the applicant had vacated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The proposed vanity call sign system is designed to be practicable to administer and simple for the amateur community
to use. Comments are invited on the entire proposal and specifically on the following matters. Could other means,
such as magnetic computer disks, be used to apply directly to the Commission for a vanity call sign in lieu of the traditional
paper application form? Could some type of access be made available to the public to check with the Commission for call
sign availability? What options are available so that the public could apply for a license electronically and receive
authorization to begin operation by the same means?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In addition, commenters may wish to submit alternatives suggesting ways that military recreation and RACES stations
might be able to be brought into a system that would afford them call signs of choice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The proposed rules are set forth at the end of this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. This is a non-restricted notice and comment rule making proceeding.

 presentations are permitted, except during the Sunshine Agenda period, provided they are disclosed as specified
in the Commission's Rules. See generally 47 CFR 1.1202, 12.1203, and 1.1206(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In accordance with section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commission certifies
that the proposed rules would not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
business entities because the amateur stations that are the subject of this proceeding would not be authorized to
transmit any communications where the station licensee or control operator has a pecuniary interest. See &sect;97.113(a)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. This Notice of Proposed Rule Making and the proposed rule amendments are issued under the authority of sections
4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i) and 303(r).

Administration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to its authority under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u),
the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) adopts the following Order: Grant of authority for subzone status, Dril-Quip,
Inc. (Oil Field Equipment), Houston, Texas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, by an Act of Congress approved June 18, 1934, an Act ``To provide for the establishment *&blank;*&blank;*
of foreign-trade zones in ports of entry of the United States, to expedite and encourage foreign commerce, and for
other purposes,'' as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u) (the Act), the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) is authorized
to grant to qualified corporations the privilege of establishing foreign-trade zones in or adjacent to U.S. Customs
ports of entry; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the Board's regulations (15 CFR part 400) provide for the establishment of special-purpose subzones when
existing zone facilities cannot serve the specific use involved; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, an application from the Port of Houston Authority, grantee of Foreign-Trade Zone 84, for authority to establish
a special-purpose subzone for export activity at the oil field equipment manufacturing facilities of Dril-Quip,
Inc., in Houston, Texas, was filed by the Board on May 10, 1993, and notice inviting public comment was given in the

 (FTZ Docket 17&hyph;93, 58 FR 28952, 03&hyph;18&hyph;93); and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whereas, the Board has found that the requirements of the FTZ Act and Board's regulations are satisfied, and that approval
of the application for export manufacturing activity is in the public interest;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Now, therefore, the Board hereby authorizes the establishment of a subzone (Subzone 84K) at the Dril-Quip, Inc.,
facilities in Houston, Texas, at the locations described in the application, subject to the FTZ Act and the Board's
regulations, including &sect;400.28, and subject to a restriction requiring that privileged foreign status (19
CFR 146.41) shall be elected on all foreign merchandise admitted to the subzone.

Pursuant to its authority under the Foreign-Trade Zones Act of June 18, 1934, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a&hyph;81u),
the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) adopts the following Order: Grant of authority for subzone status: Wisconsin

activity at the infant formula/dairy products manufacturing plant of Wisconsin Dairies Cooperative in Preston,

Whereas, the Board has found that the requirements of the FTZ Act and Board's regulations are satisfied, and that approval
of the application for export processing is in the public interest;

Now, therefore, the Board hereby authorizes the establishment of a subzone (Subzone 119D) at the Wisconsin Dairies
Cooperative plant in Preston, Minnesota, at the location described in the application, subject to the FTZ Act and
the Board's regulations, including &sect;400.28, and subject to the further requirement that all foreign-origin

In accordance with &sect;&sect;353.22(a) and 355.22(a) of the Commerce regulations, an interested party may request
in writing that the Secretary conduct an administrative review. For antidumping reviews, the interested party must
specify for which individual producers or resellers covered by an antidumping finding or order it is requesting a
review, and the requesting party must state why the person desires the Secretary to review those particular producers
or resellers. If the interested party intends for the Secretary to review sales of merchandise by a reseller (or a producer
if that producer also resells merchandise from other suppliers) which was produced in more than one country of origin,
and each country of origin is subject to a separate order, then the interested party must state specifically which
reseller(s) and which countries of origin for each reseller the request is intended to cover.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven copies of the request should be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, International
Trade Administration, room B&hyph;099, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230. The Department also
asks parties to serve a copy of their requests to the Office of Antidumping Compliance, Attention: Pamela Woods, in
room 3069&hyph;A of the main Commerce Building. Further, in accordance with &sect;353.31(g) or 355.31(g) of the
Commerce Regulations, a copy of each request must be served on every party on the Department's service list. The Department
will publish in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Department does not receive, by January 31, 1994, a request for review of entries covered by an order or finding
listed in this notice and for the period identified above, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess
antidumping or countervailing duties on those entries at a rate equal to the cash deposit of (or bond for) estimated
antidumping or countervailing duties required on those entries at the time of entry, or withdrawal from warehouse,
for consumption and to continue to collect the cash deposit previously ordered.

We preliminarily determine that sebacic acid from the People's Republic of China (PRC) is being, or is likely to be,
sold in the United States at less than fair value, as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the
Act). The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.

Since the initiation of this investigation (58 FR 43339, August 16, 1993), the following events have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 16, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) sent the PRC's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) a mini-Section A questionnaire (i.e., the section regarding sales volume and value). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 2, 1993, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department of its preliminary determination
that there is a reasonable indication that an industry in the United States is materially injured by reason of imports
of sebacic acid from the PRC that are allegedly sold at less than fair value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 27, 1993, MOFTEC submitted its mini-Section A response and on September 30, 1993, the Department sent
MOFTEC the antidumping questionnaire. (This antidumping questionnaire is divided into three sections and two attachments:
(1) Section A requests general information on each company; (2) Section C requests information on, and a listing of,
U.S. sales made during the period of the investigation (POI); (3) Section D requests information on the production
process; (4) Attachment I requests information for a market-oriented industry (MOI) claim; and (5) Attachment II
requests information for a separate rates claim.) As a courtesy, we sent a copy of the questionnaire to those companies
identified as possible exporters of sebacic acid to the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 30, 1993, we requested that the petitioner, four exporters (``respondents'') who had entered a notice
of appearance before the Department (Sinochem International Chemicals Company (Sinochem International), Sinochem
Jiangsu Import &amp; Export Corporation, Tianjin Chemicals Import &amp; Export Corporation (Tianjin), and Guangdong
Chemicals Import &amp; Export Corporation (Guangdong)), and MOFTEC submit any publicly available published information
that they wished the Department to consider when valuing the factors of production in this investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 22, 1993, the same four exporters who had entered a notice of appearance submitted responses to Section
A of the questionnaire. On October 29, 1993, we sent each company a Section A deficiency questionnaire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 1, 1993, the four exporters submitted responses to Sections C and D and Attachments I and II of the questionnaire.
On November 9, 1993, we sent MOFTEC an Attachment I supplemental questionnaire. Also on November 9, 1993, we sent the
four exporters deficiency questionnaires on Sections C and D and Attachment I. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 12, 1993, we received Section A deficiency responses from the four exporters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 16, 1993, the petitioner and the four exporters submitted publicly available published information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 16, 1993, we sent a letter to each of the 13 non-responding PRC exporters to whom we had sent a copy of the questionnaire.
We again requested that they respond to the Department's questionnaire or provide a certification that they did not
export or sell subject merchandise during the POI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also on November 16, 1993, we sent supplemental Attachment II questionnaires to MOFTEC and the four responding exporters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 19, 1993, the Department sent to the petitioner and the four exporters a publicly available published
information deficiency questionnaire. On November 23, 1993, the petitioner provided comments on the information
submitted by the four exporters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 26, 1993, we sent a letter to the Guangdong and Jiangsu provincial governments and the Beijing municipal
government requesting information in order to more completely evaluate the issue of whether the four exporters should
receive separate antidumping duty rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 29, 1993, we received Sections C and D deficiency responses from the four exporters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From November 29, 1993, through December 3, 1993, we received certifications from three Chinese exporters (Sinochem
China National Chemicals Import &amp; Export Corporation, Yunnan Minmetals &amp; Chemicals Import &amp; Export
(Group) Corporation, and Shanghai Chemicals Import and Export Corporation) which state that each entity did not
ship sebacic acid to the United States during the POI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 3, 1993, the four exporters provided a response to the Department's publicly available published information
deficiency questionnaire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 13, 1993, we received a letter from MOFTEC objecting to the November 26, 1993, questionnaires we sent to
the provincial and municipal governments. On December 17, 1993, we received a response to our November 26, 1993, separate
rates clarification questionnaire from the Guangdong Commission of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. On December
20, 1993, we received a response from the Jiangsu provincial government.

Also, on December 20, respondents requested that, in the event of an affirmative determination in this investigation,
the Department postpone the final determination an additional 60 days from the date of publication of the affirmative
preliminary determination. See the ``Postponement of Final Determination'' section of this notice. On December
23, 1993, we received a response from the Beijing municipal government but we did not receive a response to our supplemental
Attachment II questionnaire from MOFTEC or from the four responding exporters.

 dibasic acid. Sebacic acid is sold generally as a free-flowing powder/flake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sebacic acid has numerous industrial uses, including the production of nylon 6/10 (a polymer used for paintbrush
and toothbrush bristles and paper machine felts), plasticizers, esters, automotive coolants, polyamides, polyester
castings and films, inks and adhesives, lubricants, and polyurethane castings and coatings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sebacic acid is currently classifiable under subheading 2917.13.00.00, of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the
United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written
description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.

Market-Oriented Industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All of the respondents in this investigation have claimed that the sebacic acid industry is an MOI. In their November
1, 1993, responses, the respondents claim that all of the manufacturers' material and non-material inputs used to
produce sebacic acid were purchased at market-driven prices during the POI and that none of the factories or the factories'
suppliers produced any of the inputs for sebacic acid for in-plan production. Accordingly, these respondents state
that it is appropriate for the Department to use the PRC prices for material and non-material inputs for valuing the
inputs used to produce sebacic acid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Preliminary Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sulfanilic Acid from the People's Republic of China
(57 FR 9409, 9411; March 18, 1992) (Sulfanilic Acid), the Department set forth the following criteria to be used in
determining whether an MOI exists in an economy which would otherwise be considered non-market: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;For merchandise under investigation, there must be virtually no government involvement in setting prices
or amounts to be produced. For example, state-required production of the merchandise, whether for export or domestic
consumption in the non-market economy country would be an almost insuperable barrier to finding a market-oriented
industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The industry producing the merchandise under investigation should be characterized by private or collective
ownership. There may be state-owned enterprises in the industry but substantial state ownership would weigh heavily
against finding a market-oriented industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Market-determined prices must be paid for all significant inputs, whether material or non-material, and
for an all but insignificant proportion of all the inputs accounting for the total value of the merchandise under investigation.
For example, an input price will not be considered market-determined if the producers of the merchandise under investigation
pay a state-set price for the input or if the input is supplied to the producers at government direction. Moreover,
if there is any state-required production in the industry producing the input, the share of state-required production
must be insignificant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If these conditions are not met, then, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.52, the producers of the merchandise under investigation
will be treated as non-market economy (NME) producers, and the foreign market value will be calculated by using prices
and costs from a surrogate country, in accordance with sections 773(c)(3) and (4) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 9, we issued an MOI deficiency questionnaire to the respondents and sent a supplemental MOI questionnaire
to MOFTEC. This questionnaire contained questions concerning the identity of the entire sebacic acid industry,
the ownership of all entities which produce sebacic acid or supply inputs used to produce sebacic acid, and whether
any inputs were subject to in-plan production. Since we did not receive the responses to our questionnaire on December
23, 1993, we did not have sufficient information on the record for our preliminary determination to determine whether
the sebacic acid industry during the POI was an MOI. Therefore, we will address the respondents' MOI claim in our final
determination.

Separate Rates

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether an NME exporter is eligible for a separate antidumping duty rate, the Department first analyzes
ownership. If an exporter is owned by the central government, the Department will not issue a separate rate for that
exporter. Instead, the Department assigns to all exporters owned by the central government a single, weighted-average
margin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Compact Ductile Iron Waterworks Fittings and
Accessories Thereof from the People's Republic of China (58 FR 37908; July 14, 1993), the Department determined that
NME exporters owned by the central government are not eligible for antidumping duty rates separate from each other
because ownership by the central government enables the government to manipulate prices, whether or not it takes
advantage of its opportunity to do so during the POI. Accordingly, entities owned by the central government cannot
be eligible for rates different or separate from each other. To calculate a rate for exporters owned by the central
government, the Department requires that all potential respondents that are owned by the central government reply
to the antidumping questionnaire. Only complete responses from all the entities owned by the central government
could enable the Department to calculate a weighted-average antidumping margin for the central government-controlled
entities.

In the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Helical Spring Lock Washers from the People's
Republic of China (58 FR 48833; September 20, 1993) (Lock Washers), the Department determined that if an exporter
is not owned by the central government the Department will consider issuing a separate rate. This is because the opportunity
for the central government to manipulate the exporter's prices is less than its opportunity to control the prices
of enterprises owned by the central government. However, as in the case of exporters owned by the central government,
it would still be possible for enterprises under common ownership (e.g., provincial governments, local governments,
collectives, etc.) to have their prices manipulated by the common owner. All firms under common ownership which produce
or sell subject merchandise during the POI must cooperate in the investigation to enable the Department to calculate
a weighted-average dumping margin for them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this investigation, MOFTEC has informed the Department that the central government does not own any of the responding
exporters of sebacic acid. Furthermore, the responding exporters stated for the record that they do not share ownership
with each other or with any other exporter of sebacic acid. Because non-responding exporters of sebacic acid are located
in the same municipality as Sinochem International and in the same province as Guangdong, we requested separate rates
information from the Beijing municipal government and Guangdong provincial government. We also requested similar
information from the Jiangsu provincial government. Though we have received a response from the Guangdong and Jiangsu
provincial governments, we received a response from the Beijing municipal government too late to consider for the
preliminary determination. After examining the responses submitted by the Guangdong and Jiangsu provincial governments,
we are concerned that the PRC government agencies have not provided information requested by the Department in an
NME investigation. Because the responding companies have stated on the record that they are not owned by the central
government or any other jurisdiction or entity that owns other exporters of sebacic acid, the lack of information
in the two local government responses to our questionnaire should not control our separate rates decision for the
preliminary determination. However, we encourage provincial and municipal government entities to respond, with
the assistance of MOFTEC if appropriate, because this issue will be reconsidered before making the final separate
rates determination in this investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given that each of the four responding exporters states that it is neither owned by the central government nor owned
by another jurisdiction or entity that also owns other exporters of the subject merchandise, we have determined that
these respondents are eligible to be considered for separate rates. The criteria the Department relies upon to establish
whether or not separate rates are appropriate are those put forward in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than
Fair Value: Sparklers from the People's Republic of China (56 FR 20588; May 6, 1991) (Sparklers). Under the Sparklers
criteria, the Department issues separate rates where respondents can demonstrate both

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 absence of central government control over export activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this investigation, each of the four cooperative exporters has documented that its business license provides
that its ownership is distinguished from central-government ownership. In addition, MOFTEC has stated that it does
not own or control the exporters or producers of sebacic acid. This information indicates that there is a de jure absence
of central government control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each of the four cooperating respondents has asserted and provided evidence such as sales contracts that it establishes
its own export prices and keeps the proceeds of its export sales and that its management operates with complete autonomy.
This information indicates the de facto absence of central government control with respect to exports. Consequently,
we have determined that these four cooperating exporters have met the criteria set forth in Sparklers and we have used
their information to calculate a separate rate for each of them.

Surrogate Country 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 773(c) of the Act requires the Department to value the factors of production, to the extent possible, in one
or more market economy countries that are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the non-market economy
country, and that are significant producers of comparable merchandise. The Department has determined that India
and Pakistan are the most comparable to the PRC in terms of overall economic development, based on per capita gross
national product (GNP), the national distribution of labor, and growth rate in per capita GNP. (See memorandum from
the Office of Policy to David L. Binder, dated September 29, 1993.) The Department has also determined that India is
a producer of the subject merchandise. Because India fulfills both requirements outlined in the statute, India is
the preferred surrogate country for purposes of valuing the factors of production used in producing the subject merchandise.
In cases where we were unable to obtain surrogate values from India, we have used values obtained in Pakistan. Specifically,
we have resorted to Pakistan for two surrogate values, where publicly available published values in India were either
significantly outdated or not obtainable. We have obtained and relied upon publicly available published information
wherever possible.

Fair Value Comparisons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether sales of sebacic from the PRC to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared
the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign
Market Value'' sections of this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
United States Price 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because the subject merchandise was sold
to unrelated purchasers in the United States prior to importation and because exporter's sales price methodology
was not otherwise indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those exporters that responded to the Department's questionnaire, we calculated purchase price based on packed,
CIF prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland
freight, ocean freight, marine insurance, and foreign brokerage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We based the deduction for foreign inland freight on freight rates in India, as the respondents reported the use of
PRC transportation services in incurring this charge. The respondents also reported the use of PRC-based providers
for ocean freight and marine insurance. We based ocean freight on the current tariff rate in the Asia North America
Eastbound Rate Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For foreign brokerage and handling and marine insurance, we used publicly summarized versions of these two expenses
reported in the antidumping duty investigation of sulfur dyes, including sulfur vat dyes, from India (see memorandum
to the file dated December 27, 1993).

Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories which produced the subject merchandise
for these respondents. The factors used to produce sebacic acid include materials, labor, and energy. To calculate
FMV, the reported factors of production were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate values for the different inputs.
(For a complete analysis of the surrogate values used, see our preliminary concurrence memorandum, dated December
27, 1993.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining which surrogate value to use for valuing each factor of production, we selected, where possible, the
publicly available published value which was: (1) An average non-export value; (2) within the POI; (3) product-specific;
and (4) tax-exclusive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We used surrogate transportation rates to value inland freight from the factories to ports. In the case of material
inputs, we also used surrogate transportation rates to value the transportation of inputs to the factories. In those
cases where a respondent failed to provide transportation distances, we applied the longest truck rate from our surrogate
data as best information available (BIA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value castor oil, we used publicly available published information from The Times of India. This source provided
a non-export price during the POI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value caustic soda, sodium chloride, zinc oxide, phenal, and glycerine, we used publicly available published
information from Chemical Business. This source provided a non-export price during the POI which did not appear to
include Indian excise or provincial sales taxes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value sulfuric acid, cresol, and caproyl alcohol, we used publicly available published information from Chemical
Weekly. This source provided a non-export price during the POI which was inclusive of taxes. However, because we did
not have the necessary information to deduct taxes, we did not remove the taxes from these prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value activated carbon and fatty acid, we used publicly available published information from the Monthly Statistics
of the Foreign Trade of India. In addition, to value macropore resin we used a comparable product's price from Monthly
Statistics of the Foreign Trade of India. This source was the only one we found which provided publicly available published
price information for these material inputs. Because these prices were prior to the POI, we adjusted the factor values
to account for inflation between the time period in question and the POI using wholesale price indices (WPIs) published
in International Financial Statistics (IFS) by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value steam coal, we used publicly available published information from the 1993 OECD IEA Statistics. This was
the most current publicly available published information we found that provided a price for steam coal. Because
the price quoted was prior to the POI, we adjusted the factor values to account for inflation between the time period
in question and the POI using WPIs published in IFS by the IMF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value electricity, we used publicly available published information from the Monthly Statistical Bulletin published
by the Pakistani Federal Bureau of Statistics. This source provided an electricity rate for industrial use in the
POI. We found that the published information for Indian electricity rates was either outdated or appeared to be non-specific.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To value water, we used a cable from the U.S. consulate in Pakistan. We used this cable because we could not locate a value
for water in any Indian or Pakistani publication. Because the price contained in the cable was for a period prior to
the POI, we adjusted the factor values to account for inflation between the time period in question and the POI using
WPIs published in IFS by the IMF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value labor costs, we used the International Labor Office's 1992 Yearbook of Labor Statistics. To determine the
number of hours in an Indian workday, we used the Country Reports: Human Rights Practices for 1990. Because the published
labor rate was prior to the POI, we adjusted the factor values to account for inflation between the time period in question
and the POI using the consumer price index published in IFS by the IMF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value factory overhead, selling, general and administrative expenses, and profit, we calculated percentages
based on elements of industry group income statements from The Reserve Bank of India Bulletin. We did not include an
amount for energy in our factory overhead calculation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To calculate FMV for one ton of sebacic acid, we added each of the costs derived above. We also added to FMV, where appropriate,
an amount for packing labor based on the appropriate Indian wage rate, and an amount for packing materials based on
Indian prices from the Monthly Statistics of the Foreign Trade of India. We made no adjustments for selling expenses.
Finally, we added surrogate freight costs for the delivery of inputs and packing materials to the factories producing
sebacic acid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this investigation, respondents stated that the factories produce three valuable by-products (glycerine, fatty
acid, and caproyl alcohol) in the course of producing sebacic acid. Respondents maintain that the Department should
deduct the value of these three by-products from the cost of manufacture. We disagree with the respondents that the
products are all by-products, and that the value of each should be deducted from the cost of manufacture of sebacic
acid. Rather, as discussed below, we agree that fatty acid is a by-product but determine that glycerine and caproyl
alcohol should not be considered by-products in this case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three products in question are all yielded during the production of sebacic acid and the products are an unavoidable
consequence of the production of sebacic acid. These products are produced from the same raw materials, by the same
equipment, during the same manufacturing operations, as those used for sebacic acid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, by-products are treated differently from other types
of products (i.e. joint or co-products) for purposes of determining a product's costs. The distinction between by-products
and these other products is based on relative sales value. By-products are identified by their relatively insignificant
sales value, whereas these other products, regardless how they are referred to, generally have significant sales
value relative to the product under investigation. In this case, we determined whether the value of a product was significant
or insignificant based on the quantity yielded and the value assigned to each product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine the relative values of all subsidiary products and the subject merchandise, we took into account the
fact that: (1) The factories generally sell the subsidiary products in the domestic market; (2) the factories sell
sebacic acid in the domestic market; (3) the PRC renminbi is a non-convertible currency; and (4) the factories' costs
and profits have not been considered because we have not yet addressed respondents' MOI claim. In accordance with
the hierarchy for preferred input values as set forth in the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain
Carbon Steel Butt-Weld Pipe Fittings From the People's Republic of China, 57 FR 21058 (May 18, 1992) (Comment 4) and
the publicly available published information selection methodology noted above, we used surrogate values from
India for sebacic acid, glycerine, caproyl alcohol, and fatty acid to determine the relative value of each product
based on the production of one metric ton of sebacic acid, as well as to determine the total value of one metric ton of
sebacic acid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this case, we determine that fatty acid is a by-product because the overall value of fatty acid is insignificant
compared to the relative value among all of the ``subsidiary'' products and the subject merchandise. As a by-product,
we subtracted the sales revenue of fatty acid from the production costs of the other products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of the preliminary determination, we determine that glycerine and caproyl alcohol are not by-products.
The value of glycerine for two of the four factories and the value of caproyl alcohol for all four factories is significant
compared to the relative value of all of the products manufactured as a result of or during, the process of manufacturing
sebacic acid. The reason why we find that glycerine should not be considered as a by-product is because we conclude
that the quantity of production of this product appears subject to manipulation by management based on the variation
in the quantity yield among the four factories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we allocated the factor inputs, e.g., materials, used to produce glycerine and caproyl alcohol, by the
relative quantity of output of these two products and sebacic acid. We did not allocate the amount of labor, energy
usage or factory overhead among the products because we did not have the information to allow us to make accurate adjustments

The Department's policy, as set forth in Lock Washers, is that all potential exporters owned by a given entity must
cooperate in our investigation in order for the response to be considered complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MOFTEC did not submit a consolidated questionnaire response on behalf of all PRC exporters of sebacic acid. As noted
above, the list of PRC exporters of sebacic acid submitted by MOFTEC contained the names of firms which have not responded
to the Department's antidumping questionnaire. Since the Department must receive an adequate questionnaire response
from each entity to which a separate dumping rate can be applied, all non-responding entities must receive a PRC country-wide
rate. In the absence of adequate questionnaire responses from the other exporters of sebacic acid, we have based PRC
country-wide rate on BIA. Section 776(c) of the Act provides that whenever a party refuses or is unable to produce information
requested in a timely manner and in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes an investigation, the Department
shall use BIA. We have done so in this investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology based on the degree of respondents'
cooperation. According to the Department's two-tiered BIA methodology, when a company refuses to provide the information
requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate
for the Department to assign to that company the higher of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the
highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation. This methodology for assigning BIA has been upheld
by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. (

that they have been uncooperative in this investigation. As BIA for these exporters, we are assigning the highest
margin provided in the petition (243.40) as the PRC country-wide rate, in accordance with the two-tiered BIA methodology
under which the Department imposes the most adverse rate upon those respondents who refuse to cooperate or otherwise
significantly impede the proceeding. No adjustments were made to petitioner's calculations.

No ``All Others'' rate will be established for the PRC. Instead, a country-wide rate is applied to all imports of sebacic
acid from the PRC for those PRC exporters which were unable to demonstrate that they were entitled to a separate rate.
Because we are assigning a country-wide rate in this situation, there is no need to assign an ``All Others'' case deposit
rate for PRC entities.

As stated above, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.20(b), respondents, which account for a significant portion of the
merchandise covered in this proceeding, have requested in writing that, in the event of an affirmative determination,
the Department postpone the final determination an additional 60 days from the publication of the preliminary determination.
Accordingly, because we find no compelling reason to deny the request, we are postponing the date of the final determination
until not later than 135 days after the date of publication of this notice.

Hainan Feitian Electrontech Co., Ltd. (Hainan), Shaanxi Minmetals (Shaanxi), Xiamen Abrasive Co. (Xiamen), 7th
Grinding Wheel Factory Import and Export Corp., Qinghai Metals and Minerals Import &amp; Export Corp., and The Import
and Export Corporation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, responding exporters in this proceeding, account for
a significant proportion of exports of merchandise covered by this investigation. On December 1 and 3, 1993, these
exporters requested that the Department of Commerce (the ``Department'') postpone its final determination until
not later than 135 days after the date of publication of the preliminary determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our November 29, 1993, preliminary determination (58 FR 64549, December 8, 1993) in this proceeding was affirmative.
In accordance with section 735(a)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) and 19 CFR 353.20(b), when, subsequent
to an affirmative preliminary determination, we receive a request for postponement of the final determination from
exporters who account for a significant proportion of the merchandise under investigation, we are required, absent
compelling reasons for denial, to grant the request. Accordingly, we are postponing our final determination as to
whether sales of silicon carbide from the PRC have been made at less than fair value until not later than April 22, 1994.

Amended Preliminary Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 2, 1993, we disclosed our calculations for the preliminary determination to counsel for Hainan, Shaanxi,
and Xiamen. On December 7, 1993, we received timely submissions from each of these three exporters alleging ministerial
errors in the Department's preliminary determination calculations. (For specific details of these allegations
and our analysis of them, see Memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford of December 20, 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of these exporters, Hainan, alleged that the Department made certain errors with respect to the valuation of freight
rates and packing materials. We agree, and in accordance with procedures set forth in the proposed regulations, we
are amending Hainan's preliminary dumping margin because the corrections represent a change of more than five absolute
percentage points and more than 25 percent of the dumping margin calculated in the original (erroneous) preliminary
determination. See &sect;353.15(g)(4)(ii) of the Department's proposed regulations, 57 FR 1131 (January 10, 1992).
The corrected dumping margin for Hainan is 50.42 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rest of the alleged ministerial errors were either not ministerial in nature or could not be considered a ``significant
ministerial error.'' See &sect;353.15(g)(4) of the Department's proposed regulations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given to the States of Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South
Dakota, and Wisconsin, their political subdivisions and combinations thereof, and to private or public nonprofit
organizations and associations that, pursuant to Title III of Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;75, sections 202 (a)(5) and (c)
of the International Travel Act of 1961, as amended, and 42 U.S.C. 3151, a total of $3 million is available from the USTTA
to the States affected by the major, widespread flooding of 1993, to assist projects to promote tourism within the
United States and from the contiguous Canadian market. As used in this notice, ``private or public non-profit organization
or association'' means an institution, organization, or association, either private or public, which has tax exempt
status as defined in section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These funds are intended to defray the costs of increased tourism promotion needs resulting from the flooding. An
applicant may receive no more than one award for this disaster. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only eligible applicants from the nine eligible States whose applications receive a final evaluation score of 80
or greater will be considered for an award. No applicant will be awarded funds unless the application includes a project
or projects from at least two of the six project areas set forth in section IV.C., below. No applicant will be awarded
funds unless the application includes: (1) Documentation demonstrating that all programs set forth in the application
are or will be effectively coordinated with other affected entities in the State; and (2) a marketing plan that contains
clearly stated objectives for a time period of one year and procedures for credible evaluation and tracking, and that
is integrated (in terms of multiple activities) with a generally cohesive approach. Further, no applicant will be
awarded funds unless the projects for which funding is sought are aimed at market(s) which have potential for mitigating
the tourism-related negative effects of the disaster. The application must include credible market research to
support this potential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The maximum amount an applicant from the States of Missouri, Iowa and Illinois, whose tourism industries have been
most severely affected by the floods, shall be awarded is $400,000 and cannot exceed an aggregate of $400,000 annually
for such projects for each State. Applicants from the States of Nebraska, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota,
Kansas and Wisconsin shall be eligible to receive up to $300,000 and cannot exceed an aggregate of $300,000 annually
for such projects for each State. The minimum amount for which an applicant may apply is $200,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on individual State funding limitations, applicants will be awarded assistance in descending order starting
with the applicant whose proposal has the highest final evaluation score. Subject to the availability of funds, grants
will be awarded on a state-by-state basis according to final evaluation scores, State funding limitations, and broad
geographic distribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The funding instrument will be a grant unless it is anticipated that the USTTA will be substantially involved in the
implementation of the project for which an award is to be made, in which case the funding instrument will be a cooperative
agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event that all funds have not been obligated after the first competition, a second competition will be announced.
Applicants from the eligible States that have not reached their maximum limitation, as noted above, will be invited
to apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To support the tourism promotional effort financed by this program, a comprehensive national public relations campaign
will be developed to encourage recovery of visitation to the affected region. Components of the campaign may include,
but are not limited to, public service announcements (broadcast or print), development of a ``1&hyph;800'' number
for tourist information, and endorsements by celebrity spokespersons. Applicants are encouraged to utilize the
umbrella campaign in their overall effort.

I. Selection Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications will be reviewed and judged individually, independent from all other applications, by each of four
qualified evaluators acting without consultation among themselves. Each evaluator will score each application
by awarding points for each of the three (3) evaluation criteria set forth in IV, below. Scores awarded for each evaluation
criterion will be multiplied by the weight assigned to that criterion. A maximum score of 100 points may be awarded
to an application. Once scores have been determined individually by each evaluator, a final score for each application
will be determined by averaging the scores provided by each of the four evaluators.

Take notice that on December 20, 1993, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL), P.O. Box 1396, Houston,
Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;149&hyph;000 an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas
Act for permission and approval to abandon a 652 horsepower compressor unit and appurtenant facilities in Nueces
County, Texas, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TGPL proposes to abandon by sale the compressor, which is located at the interconnection between TGPL's Petronilla
Lateral and the pipeline system of Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) in Nueces County. It is
stated that the compressor was installed under Commission authorization in Docket No. CP80&hyph;533&hyph;000
by order issued March 23, 1981. It is asserted that the compressor was installed to alleviate capacity constraints
on TGPL's Petronilla Lateral so that TGPL could take delivery of up to 30,000 Mcf of gas per day which was imported from
Mexico at an existing delivery point with Texas Eastern. It is explained that TGPL was purchasing gas from Border Gas,
Inc. for system supply purposes, but that TGPL has not purchased gas under the gas purchase contract since December
1984 and does not plan to resume such purchases. It is stated that the proposed abandonment would have no impact on the
daily design capacity or operating conditions on TGPL's system. It is further stated that no customers would lose
service as a result of the proposed abandonment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before January
7, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity.
If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing
is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for TGPL to appear or be
represented at the hearing.

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,

California-based corporations and officers, who purported to hairbows, from making any material misrepresentations
regarding earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity and from making misrepresentations about
the marketplace demand for any product or service. In addition, the proposed settlement would require the respondents
to pay $1.9 million to the Commission for consumer redress or disgorgement.

may be used in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation
not contained in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the order.

If, upon consideration of respondents' evidence and other information before it, the FTC determines that there are
any material misrepresentations or omissions in the financial statements and related documents, that determination
shall cause the entire amount of monetary liability of one million nine hundred thousand dollars ($1,900,000) to
become immediately due and payable to the Federal Trade Commission, and interest computed at the rate prescribed
in 28 U.S.C. &sect;1961, as amended, shall immediately begin to accrue on the unpaid balance. Proceedings initiated
under part III are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other civil or criminal remedies as may be provided by law, including

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, an agreement to a proposed consent order from
The Hairbow Company, Inc., Rainbow Productions, Inc., and Russell J. Osborne (``proposed respondents''). All of
the proposed respondents are located in Danville, California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Hairbow Company and Rainbow Productions disseminate advertising seeking individuals to assemble craft items
at home. The Hairbow Company sells instructional kits and craft materials, and/or charges registration fees, to
individuals wanting to perform such assembly work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented the weekly earnings that are regularly realized
by The Hairbow Company's home assemblers, through performing such assembly work and submitting it to The Hairbow
Company for compensation. The complaint further alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented that there
is a significant marketplace demand for the demand for the products they offer for assembly. The complaint alleges
that these misrepresentations violate Section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. &sect;45(a)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires proposed respondents to cease making any material misrepresentations, including specifically
misrepresentations regarding past, present or future earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity.
The order further prohibits misrepresentations regarding the marketplace demand for any product or service for
which proposed respondents are offering a work opportunity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also prohibits proposed respondents from making any earnings-related or profit-related claims
through using phrases such as ``up to,'' or through stating any dollar amount, unless the stated earnings or profit
figures can be achieved by an appreciable number of participants. The latter prohibition also requires disclosure
of the class of consumers who can achieve stated earnings or profit levels, where factors or conditions affecting
earnings or profits are not reasonably foreseeable by prospective workers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order additionally requires proposed respondents to retain specified records relating to their advertising
of work opportunities, the persons who paid money to participate in any work opportunity, and the earnings or profits
of participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed order requires the corporate respondent to notify the Commission of changes in corporate
structure, the individual respondent to notify the Commission of his discontinuance his present business or employment
and each new business or employment affiliation, and all proposed respondent to file compliance reports with the
Commission. Proposed respondents would be subject to civil penalties if they did not comply with any of the above order
provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also requires proposed respondents to pay to the Federal Trade Commission $1,900,000 for consumer
redress or disgorgement. This liability is suspended, however, on the basis of financial disclosures made by proposed
respondents to the FTC, with the proviso that the Commission can reopen the proceeding if it subsequently determines
that there are material misrepresentations or omissions in the financial disclosures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would prohibit, among other things, the
California-based corporations and an officer, who purported to market pillows and Christmas ornaments, from making
any material misrepresentations regarding earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity and from
making misrepresentations about the marketplace demand for any product or service. In addition, the proposed settlement
would require the respondents to pay $1.04 million to the Commission for consumer redress or disgorgement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, an agreement to a proposed consent order from
Homespun Products, Inc., G &amp; S Marketing, Inc., and Gregory A. Straw (``proposed respondents''). All of the Proposed
respondents are located in Suisun, California.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Homespun Products and G &amp; S Marketing disseminate advertising seeking individuals to assemble craft items at
home. Homespun Products sells instructional kits and craft materials, and/or charges registration fees, to individuals
wanting to perform such assembly work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented the weekly earnings that are regularly realized
by Homespun Products' home assemblers, through performing such assembly work and submitting it to Homespun Products
for compensation. The complaint further alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented that there is a significant
marketplace demand for the products they offer for assembly. The complaint alleges that these misrepresentations
violate Section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires proposed respondents to cease making any material misrepresentations, including specifically
misrepresentations regarding past, present or future earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity.
The order further prohibits misrepresentations regarding the marketplace demand for any product or service for
which proposed respondents are offering a work opportunity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also prohibits proposed respondents from making any earnings-related or profit-related claims
through using phrases such as ``up to,'' or through stating any dollar amount, unless the stated earnings or profit
figures can be achieved by an appreciable number of participants. The latter prohibition also requires disclosure
of the class of consumers who can achieve stated earnings or profit levels, where factors or conditions affecting
earnings or profits are not reasonably foreseeable by prospective workers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order additionally requires proposed respondents to retain specified records relating to their advertising
of work opportunities, the persons who paid money to participate in any work opportunity, and the earnings or profits
of participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed order requires the corporate respondents to notify the Commission of changes in corporate
structure, the individual respondent to notify the Commission of his discontinuance of his present business or employment
and each new business or employment affiliation, and all proposed respondents to file compliance reports with the
Commission. Proposed respondents would be subject to civil penalties if they did not comply with any of the above order
provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also requires proposed respondents to pay to the Federal Trade Commission $1,040,000 for consumer
redress or disgorgement. This liability is suspended, however, on the basis of financial disclosures made by proposed
respondents to the FTC, with the proviso that the Commission can reopen the proceeding if it subsequently determines
that there are material misrepresentations or omissions in the financial disclosures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

In settlement of alleged violations of Federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would prohibit, among other things, the
New Mexico-based corporation and its officer, who claimed to sell beaded earrings, from making any material misrepresentations
regarding earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity and from making misrepresentations about
the marketplace demand for any product or service. In addition, the proposed settlement would require the respondents
to pay $1.2 million to the Commission for consumer redress or disgorgement.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, an agreement to a proposed consent order from
New Mexico Custom Designs, Inc. and Anthony L. Ingram (``proposed respondents''). Both of the proposed respondents
are located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New Mexico Custom Designs, Inc. and Anthony L. Ingram disseminate advertising seeking individuals to assemble craft
items at home. They sell instructional kits and craft materials, and/or charge registration fees, to individuals
wanting to perform such assembly work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented the weekly earnings that are regularly realized
by New Mexico Custom Designs' home assemblers, through performing such assembly work and submitting it to New Mexico
Custom Designs for compensation. The complaint further alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented
that there is a significant marketplace demand for the products they offer for assembly. The complaint alleges that
these misrepresentations violate section 5(a)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires proposed respondents to cease making any material misrepresentations, including specifically
misrepresentations regarding past, present or future earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity.
The order further prohibits misrepresentations regarding the marketplace demand for any product or service for
which proposed respondents are offering a work opportunity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also prohibits proposed respondents from making any earnings-related or profit-related claims
through using phrases such as ``up to,'' or through stating any dollar amount, unless the stated earnings or profit
figures can be achieved by an appreciable number of participants. The latter prohibition also requires disclosure
of the class of consumers who can achieve stated earnings or profit levels, where factors or conditions affecting
earnings or profits are not reasonably foreseeable by prospective workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order additionally requires proposed respondents to retain specified records relating to their advertising
of work opportunities, the persons who paid money to participate in any work opportunity, and the earnings or profits
of participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed order requires the corporate respondent to notify the Commission of changes cn Corporate
structure, the individual respondent to notify the Commission of his discontinuance of his present business or employment
and each new business or employment affiliation, and all proposed respondents to file compliance reports with the
Commission. Proposed respondents would be subject to civil penalties if they did not comply with any of the above other
provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also requires proposed respondents to pay to the Federal Trade Commission $1,200,000 for consumer
redress or disgorgement. This liability is suspended, however, on the basis of financial disclosures made by proposed
respondents to the FTC, with the proviso that the Commission can reopen the proceeding if it subsequently determines
that there are material misrepresentations or omissions in the financial disclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission having initiated an investigation of certain acts and practices of the Personal Protective
Armor Association, Inc., and it now appearing that Personal Protective Armor Association, Inc., hereinafter sometimes
referred to as proposed respondent, is willing to enter into an agreement containing an Order to cease and desist from
engaging in the acts and practices being investigated,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is hereby agreed by and between the proposed respondent and its attorney and counsel for the Federal Trade Commission
that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Proposed respondent Personal Protective Armor Association, Inc. (``PPAA'') is a corporation organized, existing
and transacting business under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Tennessee, with its office and principal place

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. PPAA admits all of the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft of Complaint here attached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. PPAA waives:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Any further procedural steps;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered into pursuant
to this agreement; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of &sect;2.34 of the Commission's Rules of Practice, the Commission
may, without further notice to proposed respondent, (1) Issue its Complaint corresponding in form and substance
with the draft of Complaint here attached and its decision containing the following Order to cease and desist in disposition
of the proceeding, and (2) make information public in respect thereto. When so entered, the Order to cease and desist

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Personal Protective Armor
Association (``PPAA''), which is located in Baltimore, Maryland. The agreement would settle charges by the Commission
that the proposed respondent violated section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act by engaging in practices that
restricted competition among PPAA members.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Complaint
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The complaint prepared for issuance by the Commission along with the proposed order alleges that PPAA and its members
have engaged in acts and practices that have unreasonably restrained competition among manufacturers of soft body
armor. The complaint alleges that PPAA members have maintained a policy against comparative advertising and have
adopted a policy not to compete in offering products liability insurance to law enforcement agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the complaint, advertising, including comparative advertising and advertising of warranties and
products liability insurance, enables firms to inform consumers as to the quality, price, and terms of sale of the
product. Consumers consider terms of sale such as products liability insurance and certification that the soft body
armor passes applicable performance standards. Comparative advertising and advertising of warranties and products
liability insurance enables firms to inform consumers about these factors and increases the information available
to consumers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint states that, during some periods, from 1986 to the present, PPAA has maintained a policy against comparative
advertising, including a policy which declares it unethical for any member to make any representation that another
member's vests have failed certification testing. The complaint also states that, during some periods, from 1986
to the present, PPAA adopted a policy to respond uniformly to bids by not offering products liability insurance in
competing for contracts from law enforcement agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that the purposes or effects of the challenged act or practice have been to restrain competition
unreasonably:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. By frustrating and restraining competition in the marketing and sale of soft body armor on the basis of price, service,
and quality;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. By depriving consumers of the benefits of truthful information about the performance of soft body armor;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. By depriving consumers of the potential value of warranties, including products liability insurance, in the purchase
of soft body armor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposed Consent Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part I of the order covers definitions. These definitions make clear that the consent order applies to directors,
trustees, councils, committees, officers, representatives, delegates, agents, employees, successors, or assigns
of PPAA. The order also defines ``soft body armor'' as concealable bullet-resistant vests generally worn by civilians
and law enforcement personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part II of the order describes the conduct prohibited by the order. Part II prevents PPAA from entering into or carrying
out any agreement between or among its members that restricts engaging in comparative advertising or restricts offering
or providing products liability insurance. Part II also prevents PPAA from restricting or interfering with the advertising
or dissemination of prices, terms, availability, characteristics, or conditions of sale of soft body armor by adopting
a policy which restricts or prohibits a member from engaging in comparative advertising or offering or providing
products liability insurance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part III of the order requires PPAA to furnish a copy of the Commission's order to each of its members; to provide each
new member who joins PPAA with a copy of the Order and complaint; and to file compliance reports for five years.

Concurring Statement of Commissioner Roscoe B. Starek, III
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
I concur in the Commission's decision to accept for public comment the Consent Order in this matter. The evidence demonstrates
that ten companies, representing more than 90% of U.S. sales of protective body armor, engaged in unreasonable restraints
of trade in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45. The agreements here restrain significant
dimensions of competitive rivalry among body armor manufacturers. Therefore, they appear likely, absent an efficiency
justification, to restrict output. The respondent has not proffered any efficiency justification for the restraints.
Under the standards set forth in the Commission's decision in Massachusetts Board of Registration in Optometry,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and its progeny, this ``inherently suspect'' conduct is appropriately condemned without a full rule of reason analysis.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In my view, however, it may have been appropriate to name as respondents the members of the Personal Protective Armor
Association (``PPAA''). This case is not typical of the Commission's cases challenging anticompetitive conduct
of state licensing boards and trade associations. In most such cases, the board or association represents hundreds
or thousands of competing entities.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Naming individual members as respondents in such cases is generally impracticable: It may unnecessarily complicate
litigation or create intractable problems for settlement negotiations.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 More importantly, naming members is often unnecessary: The respondent board or association is typically the only
(or only effective) means by which the multitude of competitors can reach and enforce an agreement restraining competition.

By contrast, competitors in the relatively concentrated protective body armor industry may be able to collude effectively
outside the auspices of the PPAA or any other formal trade association.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 If so, the proposed Consent Order, which names only the PPAA as a respondent, may provide an insufficient remedy. So
long as the PPAA is not involved,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 the same body armor manufacturers could engage in collusive conduct falling squarely within the core cease and desist
provisions of the Order without exposure to civil penalties under section 5(l) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(l).

Thus, unlike many cases involving association restraints in which the respondent association itself is a critical

Under the Order, respondent PPAA is defined to include any association that can be held to be a legal successor. The
evidence does not clearly indicate whether or not PPAA has any structural, legal, or historical advantage that would
impede the creation of a new, non-successor body armor trade association.

Of course, this conduct would expose these firms to private and state actions for damages under section 4 of the Clayton
Act, 15 U.S.C. 15. Such exposure, however, apparently did not deter the conduct that led to the Commission's action
in this matter.

In settlement of alleged violations of Federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would prohibit, among other things, the
Oregon-based respondents, who marketed potholders and mohair for use as doll's hair, from making any material misrepresentations
regarding earnings or profits or participants in any work opportunity and from making misrepresentations about
the marketplace demand for any product or service. In addition, the proposed settlement would require the respondents
to pay $536,000 to the Commission for consumer redress or disgorgement.

It is further ordered:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. That respondents shall jointly and severally pay to the FTC as consumer redress the sum of five hundred and thirty-six
thousand dollars ($536,000); provided however, that this liability will be suspended, subject to the provisions
of subparts B and D below, upon the payment of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) no later than fifteen (15) days
after the date of service of this Order. Such payment shall be made by cashier's check or certified check payable to
the Federal Trade Commission and shall be delivered to the Federal Trade Commission, San Francisco Regional Office,
901 Market Street, suite 570, San Francisco, CA 94103.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. That, in the event of respondents' default on the $25,000 payment set forth in subpart A above, the amount of five
hundred and thirty-six thousand dollars ($536,000), less the sum of any payments made pursuant to subpart A above,
shall become immediately due and payable without any notice required to be given to the respondents, and interest
computed at the rate prescribed under 28 U.S.C. 1961, as amended, shall immediately begin to accrue on the unpaid balance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. That any funds paid by respondents pursuant to subparts A and B above shall be paid into a redress fund administered
by the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used to provide direct redress to those purchasers of respondents' introductory
kits (as described in the complaint) who have not previously been reimbursed by respondents for the cost of the kit
through a refund or through the purchase of finished product. If the Federal Trade Commission determines, in its sole
discretion, that the redress to purchasers (as defined above) is wholly or partially impracticable, any funds not
so used shall be paid to the United States Treasury. Respondents shall be notified as to how the funds are disbursed,
but shall have no right to contest the manner of distribution chosen by the Commission. No portion of the payment as
herein described shall be deemed a payment of any fine, penalty, or punitive assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. That the Commission's acceptance of this Order is expressly premised upon the financial statements and related
documents previously provided by respondents to the FTC, signed and dated July 27, 1992. After service upon respondents
of an order to show cause, the FTC may reopen this proceeding to make a determination whether there are any material
misrepresentations or omissions in said financial statements and related documents. Respondents shall be given
an opportunity to present evidence on this issue. If, upon consideration of respondents' evidence and other information
before it, the FTC determines that there are any material misrepresentations or omissions in the financial statements
and related documents, that determination shall cause the entire amount of monetary liability of five hundred and
thirty-six thousand dollars ($536,000), less the sum of any payments made under subpart A above, to become immediately
due and payable to the Federal Trade Commission, and interest computed at the rate prescribed in 28 U.S.C. 1961, as
amended, shall immediately begin to accrue on the unpaid balance. Proceedings initiated under Part III are in addition
to, and not in lieu of, any other civil or criminal remedies as may be provided by law, including any proceedings the
Federal Trade Commission may initiate to enforce this Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted, subject to final approval, an agreement to a proposed consent order from
William E. Taylor and Susan L. Taylor, who do business under the name Sandcastle Creations (``proposed respondents'').
The proposed respondents are located in Newport, Oregon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
and take other appropriate action, or make final the proposed order contained in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sandcastle Creations disseminates advertising seeking individuals to assemble craft items at home. It sells instructional
kits and craft materials, and/or charges registration fees, to individuals wanting to perform such assembly work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The complaint alleges that proposed respondents have misrepresented the weekly earnings that are regularly realized
by Sandcastle Creations' home assemblers, through performing such assembly work and submitting it to Sandcastle
Creations for Compensation. The complaint alleges that this misrepresentation violates section 5(a)(1) of the
Federal Trade Commission Act (15 U.S.C. 45(a)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order requires proposed respondents to cease making any material misrepresentations, including specifically
misrepresentations regarding past, present or future earnings or profits of participants in any work opportunity.
The order further prohibits misrepresentations regarding the marketplace demand for any product or service for
which proposed respondents are offering a work opportunity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also prohibits proposed respondents from making any earnings-related or profit-related claims
through using phrases such as ``up to,'' or through stating any dollar amount, unless the stated earnings or profit
figures can be achieved by an appreciable number of participants. The latter prohibition also requires disclosure
of the class of consumers who can achieve stated earnings or profit levels, where factors or conditions affecting
earnings or profits are not reasonably foreseeable by prospective workers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order additionally requires proposed respondents to retain specified records relating to their advertising
of work opportunities, the persons who paid money to participate in any work opportunity, and the earnings or profits
of participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed order requires the individual proposed respondents to notify the Commission of their
discontinuance of their present business or employment and each new business or employment affiliation, and requires
the proposed respondents to file compliance reports with the Commission. Proposed respondents would be subject
to civil penalties if they did not comply with any of the above order provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed order also requires proposed respondents to pay to the Federal Trade Commission $536,000 for consumer
redress or disgorgement. This liability is suspended, however, on the basis of financial disclosures made by proposed
respondents to the FTC, and the payment to the Federal Trade Commission of $25,000, with the proviso that the Commission
can reopen the proceeding if it subsequently determines that there are material misrepresentations or omissions
in the financial disclosures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))), notice is given that a food
additive petition (FAP 3B4363) has been filed by PPG Industries, Inc., 440 College Park Dr., Monroeville, PA 15146.
The petition proposes to amend the food additive regulations in 1A176.200 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Defoaming agents used in coatings
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 176.200) and 1A176.210 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Defoaming agents used in the manufacture of paper and paperboard
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 176.210) to provide for the safe use of alpha-(dinonylphenyl)-omega-hydroxy-poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl)
containing 7 to 24 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of dinonylphenol, as a defoaming agent used in the production of
paper and paperboard coatings and paper and paperboard intended to contact food.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act, (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before February
4, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments. Two copies of any comments are
to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number
found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and
4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will also place on public display any amendments to, or comments on, the petitioner's
environmental assessment without further announcement in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If, based on its review, the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition
results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence
supporting that finding will be published with the final regulation in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Health and Human Services notifies Federal agencies of the laboratories currently certified to
meet standards of Subpart C of Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs (53 FR 11979, 11986).
A similar notice listing all currently certified laboratories will be published during the first week of each month,
and updated to include laboratories which subsequently apply for and complete the certification process. If any
listed laboratory's certification is totally suspended or revoked, the laboratory will be omitted from updated
lists until such time as it is restored to full certification under the Guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If any laboratory has withdrawn from the National Laboratory Certification Program during the past month, it will
be identified as such at the end of the current list of certified laboratories, and will be omitted from the monthly
listing thereafter.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing were developed in accordance with Executive Order 12564
and section 503 of Public Law 100&hyph;71. Subpart C of the Guidelines, ``Certification of Laboratories Engaged
in Urine Drug Testing for Federal Agencies,'' sets strict standards which laboratories must meet in order to conduct
urine drug testing for Federal agencies. To become certified an applicant laboratory must undergo three rounds of
performance testing plus an on-site inspection. To maintain that certification a laboratory must participate in
an every-other-month performance testing program plus periodic, on-site inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Laboratories which claim to be in the applicant stage of certification are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to be considered as meeting the minimum requirements expressed in the HHS Guidelines. A laboratory must have its letter
of certification from SAMHSA, HHS (formerly: HHS/NIDA) which attests that it has met minimum standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Subpart C of the Guidelines, the following laboratories meet the minimum standards set forth in
the Guidelines:

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the interest rate to be used by Federal agencies in the formulation and evaluation of plans
for water and related land resources is 8 percent for fiscal year 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rate has been computed in accordance with section 80(a), Public Law 93&hyph;251 (88 Stat. 34) and 18 CFR 704.39,
which: (1) Specify that the rate shall be based upon the average yield during the preceding fiscal year on interest-bearing
marketable securities of the United States which, at the time the computation is made, have terms of 15 years or more
remaining to maturity (average yield is rounded to nearest one-eighth percent); and (2) provide that the rate shall
not be raised or lowered more than one-quarter of 1 percent for any year. The Treasury Department calculated the specified
average yield to be 7.08 percent. However, application of the above mentioned limitation to the fiscal year 1993 rate
of 8.25 percent limits the change in the fiscal year 1994 rate to 8 percent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rate of 8 percent shall be used by all Federal agencies in the formulation and evaluation of water and related land
resources plans for the purpose of discounting future benefits and computing costs, or otherwise converting benefits
and costs to a common time basis.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 10, 1993, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by the Pencil Makers Association,
Inc., Marlton, NJ, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material
injury by reason of LTFV imports of certain cased pencils from the People's Republic of China and Thailand. Accordingly,
effective November 10, 1993, the Commission instituted antidumping investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;669&hyph;670
(Preliminary).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigations and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith
was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington,
DC, and by publishing the notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60670). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on December 1, 1993, and all persons who
requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on December
27, 1993. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2713 (December 1993), entitled ``Certain
Cased Pencils from the People's Republic of China and Thailand: Investigations Nos. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;669&hyph;670

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 31, 1993, the Commission instituted an investigation into allegations by complainants Tanabe Seiyaku Co.,
Ltd. and Marion Merrell Dow (``complainants'') that respondents Gyma Laboratories of America, Inc.; Mylan Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., Mylan Laboratories, Inc. and Profarmaco Norbel SRL (``Mylan respondents'') ; Orion Corporation Fermion,
Interchem Corporation, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Inc., and Copley Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (``the Fermion Respondents'');
and Abic Ltd. (``Abic'') were violating section 337 in the importation and sale of certain diltiazem hydrochloride
and diltiazem preparations allegedly manufactured abroad by a process covered by claim 1 of U.S. Letters Patent 4,438,035
(``the 
<!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;035 patent''). Plantex USA (``Plantex'') was later added as a respondent. On May 3, 1993, respondent Abic
requested that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (``PTO'') reexamine all claims of the 
<!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;035 patent. On June 25, 1993, the PTO granted Abic's request and began reexamination proceedings. On November
22, 1993, the PTO issued an office action rejecting claims of the 
<!-- PJG 0040 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;035 patent as obvious under 35 U.S.C. 103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 23, 1993, as a result of the PTO's rejection, complainants moved to suspend the Commission investigation
pending the outcome of the PTO reexamination proceedings. Respondents opposed the motion, and the Commission investigative
attorney (IA) supported the motion. On November 24, 1993, the presiding ALJ issued an ID suspending the investigation
until 30 days after the completion of reexamination proceedings at the PTO or until such time as may be prescribed by
the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 2, 1993, Abic and Plantex filed a petition for review of the ID. On December 6, 1993, the Fermion respondents
filed a response in support of Abic and Plantex's petition for review. On December 9, 1993, complainants and the IA
filed oppositions to respondents' petition for review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337) and &sect;210.53(h)
of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.53(h)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the ID and all other nonconfidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are available
for inspection during official business hours (8:45 to 5:15 p.m. in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International
Trade Commission, 500 E Street, SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;2000. Hearing-impaired
persons are advised that information on the matter can be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The persons listed in the information section of this notice have claims pending against the Islamic Republic of Iran
which are before the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission (FCSC) for adjudication. The claims are among a total of
approximately 3,100 claims of under $250,000 which were settled under an agreement between the United States and
Iran which took effect on June 22, 1990. However, these claimants have failed to inform the FCSC of their current addresses,
and despite its efforts, the FCSC has been unable to locate or contact these claimants. The purpose of this notice is
to publicize the names, claim numbers, and last known addresses of these claimants, and to inform them that unless
they furnish their current addresses to the FCSC by March 1, 1994, their claims will be dismissed from further consideration.

PPG Industries, Inc., Ford City, Pennsylvania; Negative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By an application dated December 13, 1993, the Aluminum Brick and Glass Workers Union requested administrative reconsideration
of the Department's denial of trade adjustment assistance (TAA) benefits for workers of the subject firm. The Department's
notice of negative determination was issued on November 29, 1993 and will be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 soon.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously
considered; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration
of the decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The union claims that a French Canadian firm is selling glass at prices lower than domestic producers' costs. The union
also states that the Department's survey of customers did not take into account the lowered demand for glass in the
industry and PPG plans for expansion in Mexico.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility
Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. The Department's survey of PPG's major customers shows that most respondents
did not import and those that did had very minor import purchases in the period relevant to the petition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The investigation file shows that the workers at Ford City purchase glass and fabricate it into commercial windows
unlike the French Canadian firm cited by the union which is a primary glass producer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the union's example of sheet glass and fabricated commercial glass windows, the Department does not
see any relevance. One is a raw material used in making a different product while the other is a finished article. Sheet
glass and fabricated commercial glass windows are not interchangeable, nor are they like or directly competitive
within the meaning of section 222(3) of the Trade Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, company officials indicated that there is a downswing in the production of commercial glass windows because
the commercial market currently is overbuilt. The construction boom during the 1980s resulted in record vacancy
rates for office buildings, stores and hotels_all users of fabricated glass windows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other findings show that the PPG does not import commercial glass windows.

Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation
of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly,
the application is denied.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 19, 1993, after being granted a filing extension, one of the former workers requested administrative
reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for
Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was issued
on September 27, 1993 and was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54736).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The former worker submitted additional information showing that the Midland facility had decreased sales and production
in 1993.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration
of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted.

3. Following its acquisition, the Art Work has been in the possession of Dr. Jacobson at his residence located at 630
N. Sierra Drive, Beverly Hills, California. During a 1993 audit, the Service determined that Dr. Jacobson had engaged
in prohibited transactions with the Plans by reason of his use of the Art Work for the years 1989 and 1990.

The Department notes that in 1987 the Profit Sharing Plan purchased a third party note for cash form the Norman L. Jacobson,
M.D., P.A. Profit Sharing plan, the sole participant and trustee of which is Dr. Jacobson's brother, Norman L. Jacobson.
In 1993, the Profit Sharing Plan sold the note back to the Norman L. Jacobson, M.D., P.A. Profit Sharing Plan for cash.
The Department is not granting an exemption for such purchase and sale and is expressing no opinion as to whether the
purchase and sale of such note constitutes a violation of any provision of the Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Dr. Jacobson represents that he will file Forms 5330 with the Service and pay the applicable excise taxes associated
the past prohibited transactions within ninety days of the publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the notice granting this proposed exemption. In addition, Dr. Jacobson will pay the Plans the fair market rental
value in the amount of approximately $90,000 for his use of the Art Work for years 1989 through 1993. Excise taxes will
accrue for the period between 1989 and 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. At present, the Art Work has produced no income for the Plans. In order to enable the Plans to divest themselves of
the Art Work and to invest in income-producing, marketable securities, Dr. Jacobson proposes to purchase the Art
Work from the Plans for a cash amount equal to the aggregate of the greater of either: (a) The original amount paid by
the Plan at the time of acquisition; or (b) its fair market value on the date of the Sale. Accordingly, Dr. Jacobson requests
an administrative exemption from the Department to permit his purchase of the Art Work from the Plans under the terms
and conditions described herein. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Art Work has been valued by two separate, independent, qualified appraisers, Arline Edelbaum and Jacqueline
Silverman, both the Los Angeles, California. Ms. Edelbaum is a senior member of the American Society of Appraisers
and has nineteen years experience in appraising fine arts and personal property. Ms. Silverman is a certified member
of Appraisers Association of America and has fifteen years experience in appraising modern and contemporary art.
Both appraisers represent that they are unrelated to and independent of Dr. Jacobson. Ms. Edelbaum and Ms. Silverman's
valuations of the Art Work as of June 28, 1993 and June 22, 1993, respectively, are as follows:

Because their fair market values are less than or equal to their original purchase price, ``Untitled'' and ``Fouffi
Noutti in Hell'' will be purchased by Dr. Jacobson for their original purchase prices of $135,000 and $220,000, respectively.
In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Jacobson will purchase ``Grau for $165,000, which reflects its higher fair market valuation as determined by
Ms. Edelbaum. Finally, Dr. Jacobson will purchase ``Pau'' for $275,000, which reflects its fair market value as determined
by both appraisers. Dr. Jacobson proposes to purchase the Art Work for an aggregate cash purchase price of $795,000.

6. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transactions will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 4975(c)(2) of the Code because: (a) The Sale will be a one-time cash transaction; (b) the Plan will not
be required to pay any commissions, costs or other expenses in connection with this transaction; (c) the Art Work will
be appraised by a qualified, independent appraiser; (d) the sale price for the Art Work will reflect the greater of
either: (1) The original amount paid by the Plan at the time of acquisition; or (2) its fair market value on the date of
the Sale; and (e) within ninety days of the publication in the

General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, DC. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have
complied with the requirements of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for
a hearing, unless otherwise stated, were received by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.

In the Notice of Proposed Exemption, the Department invited interested persons to submit written comments and requests
for a hearing on the exemption. All comments and requests for hearing were due by December 20, 1993. The Department
received over 100 telephone inquiries from interested persons who expressed concern over the effect, if any, of the
transaction on their pension benefits. These inquiries were responded to by a Department representative who informed
the callers that the transaction does not affect the calculation of pension benefits or the Plan's obligation to make
benefit payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department received a total of 29 written comments with only one of those comments containing a request for a hearing.

 Nine commentators stated that they did not understand the proposed exemption or how it would affect their pensions.

The remaining commentators were opposed to the granting of the exemption. The comments addressed 17 general areas
of concern about the proposed transaction. The concerns are summarized as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Questions about the correct value of Cummins Stock, including a question about the discrepancy between the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE) price quoted in the Notice and the price quoted in a national newspaper on December 2, 1993.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Concerns that the restrictions on the Stock make the Stock less valuable and increase the risk that the Plan will
not be able to dispose of the Stock in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Concerns about the wisdom of investing this much of the GEBT's assets in one company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Assertions that Tenneco would not be able to stand behind its obligation under the Contribution Obligation based
on its history of financial troubles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Concern that the letter of credit proposes to protect only 20% of the value of the Stock, leaving 80% at risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A request that Tenneco fully fund all of its pension liabilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. A request that Tenneco guarantee the value of the Stock to be contributed to the GEBT. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Questions about the possibility that the transaction will decrease the amount of pension payments to participants
and beneficiaries of the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Concerns over changes in retiree medical benefits.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
10. Questions regarding the wisdom of allowing Tenneco to contribute Cummins stock to the GEBT since, according to
the commentator, Tenneco owns Cummins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Comments indicating that the Plan participants would prefer to receive cash contributions rather than stock.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. Allegations that individuals who would be affected by the proposed transaction have not received proper notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Questions concerning the independent fiduciary's alleged determination that the Stock will experience no precipitous
declines in value in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Confusion over the consequences for the GEBT of any decline in value of the Stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Concern over the proper exercise of the voting and other privileges applicable to shareholders of the Stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Questions about the guidelines for determining if and when to adjust the amount of the letter of credit (or alternative
collateral) which secures the Contribution Obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. A request that Tenneco guarantee that the value of the contribution will not be diminished by transaction costs
when the Stock is sold at some future date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Responses to these comments were submitted by the applicant, on behalf of both Tenneco and Woodbridge, the GEBT'S
independent fiduciary. These responses are summarized as follows, corresponding in order to the comments listed
above: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. According to the applicant, subsequent to the publication of the Notice of Proposed Exemption, Cummins had a 2 for
1 stock split which accounts for the change in the price of the Stock as listed on the NYSE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The applicant notes that after a review of the Stock's past performance, Woodbridge has determined that the Stock
is a prudent investment for the Plan despite the restrictions on transferability. Furthermore, the applicant states
that the Stock's value has been determined by an independent appraisal company, taking the restrictions into account.
Finally, the applicant notes that the restrictions on transfer of the Stock will expire in July, 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The applicant explains that once the Stock is contributed to the GEBT, it will represent only 5.65% of the assets
of the GEBT. In addition, because each of the Affected Plans has an undivided interest in the assets of the GEBT, no single
plan will hold all of the Stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The applicant asserts that Standard &amp; Poors and Moody's rating of Tenneco debt as investment grade, as well
as Tenneco's recent sale of $1 billion of equity, are indications that Tenneco is a viable company. The applicant again
notes that the proposed transaction is backed by the judgment of Woodbridge as independent fiduciary, by the independent
appraisal of the Stock and by the letter of credit in the amount of 20% of the value of the Stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The applicant represents that due to Tenneco's financial condition, as described in 4. above, a letter of credit
in the amount of 20% of the value of the Stock is sufficient to protect the interests of the GEBT. The applicant represents
that the face value of the letter of credit is approximately $32,000,000. The applicant also represents that Tenneco's
financial condition is good and that its credit-worthiness is adequate security for the unsecured portion of the
Contribution Obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. According to the applicant, the contribution of the Stock to the GEBT is part of an overall strategy to ensure that
the Tenneco Plans will be fully funded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The applicant represents that the Contribution Obligation assumed by Tenneco guarantees the value of the contribution
since Tenneco is required to make a cash contribution to the GEBT to compensate for any loss in the value of the Stock
in any calendar quarter. Furthermore, the Contribution Obligation is secured by a letter of credit issued by a major
bank in the amount of 20% of the value of the Stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The applicant responds by explaining that all plans invested in the GEBT are defined benefit plans, the benefits
of which are not affected by the investment performance of plan assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Retiree medical benefits are not relevant to the proposed exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Tenneco does not own Cummins. The applicant represents that Tenneco owns less than 10% of Cummins' stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The applicant represents that the contribution of the Stock to the GEBT is essentially the same as a cash contribution
to the GEBT followed by a purchase of Cummins' stock by the GEBT. In addition, the applicant states that maintaining
the Plan assets primarily in uninvested cash would be a breach of fiduciary duties under ERISA. The applicant further
states that the GEBT will at all times maintain sufficient liquid assets to pay benefits when due. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant also represents that the Stock is not replacing cash or other assets in the GEBT; rather, the Stock is
being contributed in addition to the assets already held in the GEBT. According to the applicant, the contribution
of Stock enables Tenneco to accelerate the time at which the GEBT will receive contributions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The applicant represents that it has complied with all applicable notice requirements. An authorized representative
of Tenneco has provided the Department with a declaration under penalty of perjury attesting to the truth of the information
regarding Tenneco's notice to interested persons as required by the Department's regulations (see 29 CFR 2570.43).
In addition, in response to information indicating that several interested persons in and around Hutchinson, Kansas
had not received proper notice of the proposed exemption, the applicant represents that notice was again provided
to people in the Hutchinson area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The applicant explains that, contrary to the commentator's assertion, Woodbridge has not made any such determination
but has concluded that the Stock is a prudent investment for the GEBT, based in part on the Stock's market history over
the past 3 years. In addition, Woodbridge has determined that any decline in value of the Stock would be adequately
compensated for by the Contribution Obligation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. The applicant asserts that the Contribution Obligation ensures that the value of the stock contribution will
remain the same even if the value of the Stock decreases. The applicant explains that, if, for example, the Stock is
valued at $160,000,000 on the date of contribution to the Plan and, over the course of a year the price drops, Tenneco
would be obligated, over the course of that year, on a quarterly basis, to contribute cash so that the value of the Stock
plus the aggregate amounts of cash contributed pursuant to the Contribution Obligation equals $160,000,000. It
is represented, therefore, that the value of the intial contribution will never be diminished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. The applicant responds by explaining that Woodbridge, acting in its capacity as independent fiduciary, will
exercise the stock voting rights and the right to designate a person to the Cummins Board of Directors, pursuant to
the direction of the GEBT's Investment Committee; provided, that Woodbridge may decline to designate the Investment
Committee's choice if it determines that to do so is in the GEBT's best interests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. The applicant states that the determination regarding the increase in the amount of the letter of credit or the
need to provide alternative collateral is a simple calculation based on the difference between (a) the balance of
the letter of credit and (b) the product of the number of shares of the Stock held by the GEBT, the contribution price
of the Stock and 20%.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
17. The applicant explains that the Contribution Obligation will be in effect when the Stock is sold in the future.
According to the applicant, if the Stock is sold at a loss, any transaction costs would be accounted for by the Contribution
Obligation which would require Tenneco to contribute an amount equal to the number of shares sold, multiplied by the
difference between the realized net price and the Lowest Price (see paragraph 5 in the Notice of Proposed Exemption).
If the Stock is sold at a gain, the GEBT would bear the transaction costs. The applicant represents that it is customary
for pension plans to bear such transaction costs in similar circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only one of the interested persons who commented on the proposed exemption requested a public hearing, although several
others indicated that they wished to be notified if a hearing was scheduled. The Department has considered the concerns
expressed by the commentators and the applicant's written responses addressing such concerns, and, on the basis
of the materials provided, has determined not to hold a public hearing. Furthermore, after giving full consideration
to the entire record, including the written comments and the responses thereto, the Department has decided to grant
the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the applicant has informed the Department that it intends to enter into the transaction on December 29, 1993,
and requests that the exemption be made effective as of that date. The Department concurs with this suggested modification.

General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction
which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts
or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease
to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the
Department.

North Atlantic Energy Service Corp. et al., Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1; Environmental Assessment and Finding of
No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an order authorizing a transfer
of ownership and an amendment to the Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;86 issued to North Atlantic Energy Service
Corporation (North Atlantic/the licensee) for operation of the Seabrook Station, Unit No. 1, located in Rockingham
County, New Hampshire.

Identification of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would approve the transfer of ownership of Vermont Electric Generation and Transmission Cooperative,
Inc's. (Vermont) 0.41259 percent share of Seabrook 1 to North Atlantic Energy Company (NAEC). A license amendment
would be issued to change the footnote on page 1 of Facility Operating License No. NPF&hyph;86 by deleting Vermont,
as one of the entities for which North Atlantic is authorized to act.

The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1990, Vermont filed a claim against Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) with the United States Bankruptcy
Court which was then hearing a petition from PSNH for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code. Vermont's claim sought redress for damages which were alleged to have been incurred while PSNH had been the managing
agent for Seabrook 1. In November 1990, the two parties arrived at a settlement which included an agreement by PSNH
or its designee to purchase Vermont's share of Seabrook 1 subject to obtaining the necessary approvals from all regulatory
agencies. Subsequently, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order approving the stipulation that PSNH and Vermont had
filed describing the settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1992, in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization for PSNH that was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, Northeast
Utilities (NU) acquired PSNH in merger transactions and, after receipt of NRC approval, NAEC (a newly-formed and
wholly-owned subsidiary of NU) acquired PSNH's interest in the Seabrook 1. As the successor to PSNH's interest in
Seabrook 1, NAEC is obligated to purchase Vermont's interest in Seabrook Station. The transfer of Vermont's ownership
share in Seabrook 1 to NAEC will consummate the settlement entered into by Vermont and PSNH.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would approve the transfer of ownership of 0.41259 percent of Seabrook 1 from Vermont to NAEC.
The transfer will not involve any changes to the Seabrook 1 staff, to the facility itself, or in the manner by which Seabrook
1 is operated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has evaluated the environmental impact of the proposed action and has determined that the probability
or consequences of accidents would not be increased by the transfer of ownership, and that post-accident radiological
releases would not be greater than previously determined. Further, the Commission has determined that the transfer
of ownership would not affect routine radiological plant effluents and would not increase occupational radiological
exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts
associated with the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the transfer of ownership would not affect nonradiological plant
effluents and would have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
nonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded that the environmental effects of the proposed action are not significant, any
alternative with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal alternative would be to deny the requested approval. Denial of the application would result in no change
in current environmental impacts. The environmental impacts of the proposed action and the alternative action are
identical.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
Related to Operation of Seabrook Station, Units 1 and 2, dated December 1982.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff consulted with the State of New Hampshire and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts regarding the environmental
impact of the proposed action. The State of New Hampshire and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts had no comments on
the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have
a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the request for approval dated August 27, 1993, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW; Washington,
DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Exeter Public Library, 47 Front Street, Exeter, New Hampshire

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating
Licensing Nos. DPR&hyph;80 and DPR&hyph;82, issued to the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (the licensee), for operation
of Diablo Canyon Power Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, located in San Luis Obispo, California.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would consist of revisions to the Technical Specifications in response to the revised 10 CFR
part 20. The change would revise the limitations on the dose rate resulting from radioactive material released in
gaseous effluents, and reflect the relocation of the prior 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302. These
changes are in response to the licensee's application for amendments dated July 7, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action is needed in order to retain operational flexibility consistent with 10 CFR part 50, appendix
I, concurrent with the implementation of the revised 10 CFR part 20.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed revision, in regard to the actual release rates as referenced in the Technical Specifications (TS) as
a dose rate to the maximally exposed member of the public, will not increase the types or amounts of effluents that may
be released offsite, nor increase individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposures. Therefore, the Commission
concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes do not affect nonradiological effluents
and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant envirommental impacts associated with the proposed
amendments to the TS, any alternative to the amendments will have either no significantly different environmental
impact or will have greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments.
This would not reduce environmental impacts as a result of plant operation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement
and Addendum related to the operation of Diablo Canyon Power Plant Units 1 and 2, dated May 1973 and May 1976, respectively.

Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed license amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated July 7, 1993, which is available

<DOCTITLE>Northeast Nuclear Energy Co.; Withdrawal of Application for Amendment to Facility Operating License</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of Northeast Nuclear Energy
Company, et al. (the licensee) to withdraw its December 2, 1988 application for proposed amendment to Facility Operating
License DPR&hyph;21 for the Millstone Nuclear Power Station, Unit 1, located at the licensee's site in New London
County, Connecticut.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would have revised the Technical Specifications to reflect the implementation of modifications
during the 1989 refueling outage related to degraded grid undervoltage detection. Since the licensee plans to make
additional modifications to the undervoltage detection circuitry during the Cycle 15 refueling outage, additional
Technical Specification changes will be necessary and will be submitted prior to the outage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 1, 1989 (54 FR 5170). However, by letter dated September 10, 1993, the licensee withdrew the proposed change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated December 2, 1988, and the
licensee's later dated September 10, 1993, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents
are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resources Center, Three Rivers

An inspection of the Licensee's activities was conducted July 14&hyph;16, 1993. The results of this inspection indicated
that the Licensee had not conducted its activities in full compliance with NRC requirements. A written Notice of Violation

Notice described the circumstances surrounding the violations, the provisions of the NRC's requirements that the
Licensee had violated, and the amount of the civil penalty proposed for the violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee responded to the Notice in a letter dated November 17, 1993. In its letter, the Licensee admitted the violations
which resulted in the proposed civil penalty, but requested that the NRC reconsider the circumstances surrounding
the violations and mitigate the proposed civil penalty for reasons that are summarized in the Appendix to this order.

On October 18, 1993, a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was issued for violations
identified during an NRC inspection on July 14&hyph;16, 1993. Physicians' Laboratory Service, Inc. responded to
the Notice on November 17, 1993. The Licensee admitted the violations that resulted in the proposed civil penalty,
but requested that the NRC reconsider the circumstances surrounding the violations and mitigate the proposed civil
penalty. A restatement of the violation, and the NRC's evaluation and conclusions regarding the Licensee's request
follow:

10 CFR 35.32 (a) and (e), require, in part, that by January 27, 1992, each licensee establish and maintain a written
quality management program to provide high confidence that byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material
will be administered as directed by the authorized user. The quality management program must include written policies
and procedures to meet specific objectives, including that prior to administration, a written directive is prepared
for any administration of quantities greater than 30 microcuries of sodium iodide I&hyph;125 or I&hyph;131. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 35.2, ``Definitions,'' defines a written directive, in part, as an order in writing for a specific patient,
dated and signed by an authorized user prior to administration of a radiopharmaceutical and specifies, in part, that
for the administration of quantities greater than 30 microcuries of either sodium iodide I&hyph;125 or I&hyph;131
or any therapeutic administration of a radiopharmaceutical other than sodium iodide I&hyph;125 or I&hyph;131,
the written directive must include the dosage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Contrary to the above, between January 27, 1992, and July 27, 1992, the licensee did not establish a written quality
management program (01013). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Contrary to the above, on numerous occasions after January 27, 1992, including March 8 and 22, May 13, June 3, and
July 1, 1993, the licensee administered sodium iodide I&hyph;131 for diagnostic purposes in quantities greater
than 30 microcuries without a written directive signed by an authorized user (01023).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Licensee's Request for Mitigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the violation involving the failure to establish a written Quality Management Program, the Licensee
admitted that it did not establish a Quality Management Program by the January 27, 1992 effective date of the rule.
The Licensee states that it first learned of the requirement to establish a Quality Management Program following
receipt of the June 1992 NMSS Newsletter and that it immediately devised a plan and submitted it to the NRC by July 27,
1992. Because corrective action was taken without NRC intervention, the Licensee requested that the violation be
dismissed or mitigated to a reprimand without penalty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the violation concerning the administration of sodium iodide without a written directive signed by
an authorized user, the Licensee admitted that a ``minimal number'' of patients received dosages of greater than
30 microcuries without written directives having been prepared. The Licensee stated that it took immediate corrective
action and requested that the violation and the civil penalty be mitigated. In addition, the Licensee requested that
the NRC take into account the fact that during the past 23 years, approximately 20,000 to 23,000 diagnostic administrations
had occurred with no known misadministrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
NRC Evaluation of Licensee's Request for Mitigation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The violations were not considered separately in this case. The proposed penalty was based on the aggregate of the
two violations (i.e., a Severity Level III problem). Thus, the severity level of the violations was based on their
collective significance_that is the combination of not establishing a Quality Management Program until six months
after the effective date of the rule and not implementing the requirements of the Quality Management Program even
after a written program was established by the Licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC places a great deal of importance on its Quality Management regulation. Thus, its Enforcement Policy was revised
at the same time the rule was adopted to place an emphasis on noncompliance with the rule. Example C.6 was added to Supplement
VI, such that violations involving ``A substantial failure to implement the quality management program as required
by &sect;35.32 *&blank;*&blank;*'' was to be classified at Severity Level III (Note: This was later amended to state
``Substantial failure to implement the quality management program as required by &sect;35.32 that does not result
in a misadministration *&blank;*&blank;*'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``substantial'' has consistently been applied to failures of a programmatic, as opposed to an isolated,
nature. In this case, the Licensee's failure was deemed programmatic because the Licensee repeatedly failed to use
written directives for diagnostic administrations of sodium iodide I&hyph;131 on quantities that exceeded 30 microcuries
because of weaknesses in the program. Thus, the violations were appropriately classified in the aggregate as a Severity
Level III problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the magnitude of the proposed civil penalty, the Licensee's argument are related to the civil penalty
adjustment factors of Identification, Corrective Action and Licensee Performance. The use of these factors is described
in Section VI.B.2 of the Enforcement Policy. No adjustment was made to the proposed base penalty with respect to any
of these factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Licensee identified its failure to establish a Quality Management Program and corrected it by submitting
a plan to the NRC, the plan it submitted lacked specificity, contributing in part to the second violation, the failure
to use written directives for diagnostic administrations of I&hyph;131 in excess of 30 microcuries. The second violation
was identified by the NRC, continued for nearly a year after the Licensee became aware of the regulation, and was occurring
at the time of the license transfer. The Licensee's arguments do not provide a basis for mitigation under the identification
factor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No adjustment was made under the corrective action factor because these violations were discovered after the license
had been transferred to another entity. Thus, this factor did not, and still does not, appear to be applicable to the
circumstances of this case. In addition, although the Licensee corrected its failure to establish a Quality Management
Program, its corrective action was weak, i.e., the Licensee did not implement the use of written directives for diagnostic
procedures, as discussed above. Thus, the Licensee has not provided a basis for mitigation under the corrective action
factor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No adjustment was made under the licensee performance factor. The Licensee's performance was considered relatively
poor in the two inspections that preceded the July 14&hyph;16, 1993 inspection. Several Severity Level IV and V violations
were issued following each of the two prior inspections, one occurring in September 1991 and the other occurring in
March 1990. This was balanced, however, against the fact that the July 1993 inspection found only the violations related
to the Quality Management rule. Thus, notwithstanding the Licensee's statements about an absence of misadministration,
the Licensee has not provided a basis for mitigation under the prior performance factor.

NRC Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Licensee has not provided any information that provides a basis for reclassifying the violations or mitigating
the proposed civil penalty. The proposed civil penalty in the amount of $2,500 should be imposed by order.

By application dated February 28, 1980, the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) submitted a request for
renewal of Facility License No. R&hyph;71 for the UCLA Research Reactor Facility (UCLA facility). By letters dated
June 14 and July 26, 1984, UCLA requested termination of Facility License No. 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
R&hyph;71. A ``Notice of Proposed Issuance of Orders Authorizing Disposition of Component Parts of Terminating
Facility License'' was published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on September 24, 1984 (49 FR 37484). Following hearings and stipulations on the license renewal and termination applications
by the parties involved, an order was issued on November 8, 1985, by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that approved
a Settlement Agreement dated September 30, 1985, between the Regents of the University of California, the Campus
Committee to Bridge the Gap, and the staff of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission/NRC).
The Order also terminated UCLA License No. R&hyph;71. The Settlement Agreement stipulated a timetable for the decommissioning
of the UCLA facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By application dated October 29, 1985, as supplemented, UCLA submitted a Phase I decomissioning plan. An order authorizing
Phase I dismantling of the UCLA facility and disposition of component parts was issued by the Commission on July 14,
1986. Phase I concerned the removal of all UCLA facility components except for the concrete building structure, concrete
biological shield, components affixed to or embedded in the biological shield, the holdup tank, primary water pump,
sump pump, compressor system, floor drains, decontamination sinks, and fuel storage pits. Phase I of decommissioning
was completed on August 18, 1989.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By application dated June 10, 1988, as supplemented, UCLA submitted its Phase II decommissioning plan. An order authorizing
Phase II dismantling of the UCLA facility and disposition of component parts was issued by the Commission on July 28,
1989. Phase II decommissioning concerned the removal of components that remained after completion of Phase I decommissioning.
When Phase II decommissioning was completed, UCLA submitted final survey information on January 4 and 28 and February
22, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reactor fuel has been removed from the core and shipped to a Department of Energy (DOE) facility. The UCLA reactor
facility has been completely dismantled and all NRC and settlement agreement requirements pertaining to residual
radioactivity, personnel and external radiation exposure, and fuel disposition have been met. Confirmatory radiological
surveys verified that the UCLA facility met the recommended regulatory guidance for release of the facility for unrestricted
use. Accordingly, the Commission has found that the UCLA facility has been dismantled and decontaminated pursuant
to the Commission Orders dated July 14, 1986, and July 28, 1989, and the Settlement Agreement. Satisfactory disposition
has been made of the component parts and fuel in accordance with the Commission regulations in title 10 of the Code of
Federal Regulations (10 CFR) chapter I, and in a manner not inimical to the common defense and security, or to the health
and safety of the public. Therefore, on the basis of the Settlement Agreement, applications filed by UCLA and pursuant
to sections 104 and 161 b, i, of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the UCLA facility is released for unrestricted
use as of the date of this Order. In accordance with 10 CFR part 51, the Commission has determined that the issuance of
this Order will have no significant environmental impact. The Environmental Assessment was published in the

Yale-New Haven Hospital (Licensee), New Haven, Connecticut, is the holder of Byproduct Material License No. 06&hyph;00819&hyph;03
(License), issued by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission). The License was most recently amended
on September 15, 1993. The License authorizes the Licensee to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures with
radioactive material as well as research in accordance with the conditions specified therein. This is a broad scope
license. The License was most recently renewed on August 13, 1985, and was due to expire on August 31, 1990 but was extended
by the NRC pending staff action on the Licensee's renewal request. Based on the Licensee's application to renew the
License dated June 17, 1990, and pursuant to 10 CFR 30.37(b), the existing License has not expired and continues in
effect.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Between December 3, 1992, and January 27, 1993, the NRC performed two inspections of licensed activities at the Licensee's
facility. The inspections were conducted to review two incidents involving therapeutic misadministrations and
a failure to control licensed material that occurred between November 30 and December 1, 1992, and on January 21, 1993.
During the inspections, five violations of NRC requirements were identified. A written Notice of Violation and Proposed
Imposition of Civil Penalties (Notice) was served upon the Licensee by letter dated April 26, 1993. The Notice states
the nature of the violations, the provisions of the NRC's requirements that the Licensee had violated, and the amount
of the civil penalties proposed for the violations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee responded to the Notice on June 10, 1993. In its response, the Licensee denies Violations II.A and II.B
set forth in the Notice; questions the Severity Level classification for Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C; and requests
reduction of the civil penalties.

I.A. Condition 23 of License No. 06&hyph;00819&hyph;03 requires that licensed material be possessed and used in
accordance with statements, representations, and procedures contained in an application dated December 13, 1984.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Item 7 of that application, dated December 13, 1984, states that the Hospital Radioisotope Committee has the responsibility
of establishing and enforcing the Hospital's Radiation Safety Program to ensure the safety and welfare of hospital
personnel and property as well as protecting the surrounding community from the potential hazards of sources of ionizing
radiation used at the hospital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A procedure of the Hospital's Radiation Safety Program entitled, ``Procedure for Nursing Care of Patients Containing
Radioactive Sources for Therapy'', requires, in part, that ``during nursing care procedures, the nurse must check
all materials used by the patient .&blank;.&blank;. for radioactive sources that may have become dislodged,'' and
that ``everything used by the patient (except dishes) must be saved and monitored before disposal.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the above, the Hospital Radioisotope Committee did not enforce the Hospital's Radiation Safety Program
to ensure safety and welfare of hospital personnel and property as well as protecting the surrounding community from
the potential hazards of all sources of ionizing radiation used at the hospital. Specifically, on November 30 and
December 1, 1992, nurses on the ninth floor of Yale-New Haven Hospital removed linen pads from a brachytherapy patient's
room without first checking the pads for radioactive sources which may have become dislodged and failed to survey
the linen pads before disposal.

B. 10 CFR 20.207(a) requires that licensed materials stored in an unrestricted area be secured against unauthorized
removal from the place of storage. 10 CFR 20.207(b) requires that licensed materials in an unrestricted area and not
in storage be tended under constant surveillance and immediate control of the licensee. As defined in 10 CFR 20.3(a)(17),
an unrestricted area is any area access to which is not controlled by the licensee for purposes of protection of individuals
from exposure to radiation and radioactive materials. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the above, on December 1 and 2, 1992, licensed material consisting of a 35 millicurie cesium-137 brachytherapy
source was located, at various times, in unrestricted areas, namely, a hallway on the ninth floor of the hospital,
the laundry collection area of the hospital, and a contractor's laundry facility; and at those times, the brachytherapy
source was not under the constant surveillance and immediate control of the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. 10 CFR 20.105(b) requires, in part, that except as authorized by the Commission in 10 CFR 20.105(a), no licensee
allow the creation of radiation levels in unrestricted areas which, if an individual were continuously present in
the area, could result in his receiving a dose in excess of 2 millirems in any one hour or 100 millirems in any seven consecutive
days.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the above, on December 1 and 2, 1992, the licensee allowed the creation of radiation levels, at various

Summary of Licensee Response to the Violations in Section I 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The Licensee, in its response, states that the safety significance of the loss of the source was minimal, noting that
the potential absorbed dose to any member of the general public as a result of this incident was well below regulatory
limits. Further, the Licensee argues that the possibility of public exposure was minimized by the hospital's prompt
search for and discovery of the source. The Licensee believes that personnel and members of the public who may have
been exposed to the source received only a minimal dose as a result of this incident, noting that its calculations indicate
that the maximum dose to any exposed individual was unlikely to have exceeded a total of 30 millirems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Licensee recognizes that, under postulated worst case conditions, the exposure rate at distances less
than 2.4 meters could have exceeded the NRC's applicable limits for the general public, the Licensee argues that this
exposure condition would only have existed for very short periods of time, on the order of several minutes, and with
the bulk of the postulated exposure at a dose rate well below NRC's standards for the general public. The Licensee also
notes that the source was located in linen that was removed from a patient's room, and that since the linen is treated
as a biologically hazardous waste, it is highly unlikely that a person would have any extended contact with the source
once it had left the patient's room. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee states that immediately upon discovery that a source was missing, the Radiation Safety Officer, and
the resident physician who misplaced the source, conducted a search that promptly located and safely recovered the
missing source. The Licensee further contends that despite this corrective action, the NRC chose to treat the sequential
consequences which flowed from the initial failure as separate violations which could be treated in the aggregate
and escalated to a Severity Level III problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, while the Licensee recognizes the NRC's authority to cite for each separate violation, the Licensee
believes that the circumstances of the violations do not represent a programmatic breakdown in its radiation safety
program, and even when aggregated, do not have the safety or regulatory significance to be considered a Severity Level
III problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee argues that the 100 percent escalation of the civil penalty was not warranted since the Notice makes reference
to an incident that occurred in 1989. The NRC's enforcement policy states that a licensee's prior performance normally
refers to a period within the last two years of the inspection at issue, or the period within the last two inspections;
whichever is longer.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The Licensee concludes by requesting that the NRC exercise its discretion to reduce the civil penalty associated
with the violations in Section I of the Notice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
While the NRC agrees that the doses to members of the general public resulting from the loss of the source were small,
the source was, nonetheless, missing for a period of time in excess of twenty-three hours. During that time, the source
was in the hallway outside the patient's room for at least seventeen hours, in a basement laundry closet and in a laundry
service truck for at least an hour each, and on the floor of the laundry facility or in the laundry washing machine for
at least four and one half hours. None of these locations was controlled by the Licensee for the purposes of radiation
protection. Therefore, since the radiation levels were in excess of applicable levels for unrestricted areas for
periods of hours, this created a significant potential for an exposure in excess of regulatory limits to personnel
or members of the public, and the NRC maintains that this is a significant lack of control of licensed material.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted in Section C.1 of Supplement VI of the Enforcement Policy, violations involving a failure to control access
to licensed materials for radiation purposes (as specified in the NRC requirements) constitute Severity Level III
violations. Therefore, Violation I.B could have been individually classified at Severity Level III. However, the
NRC chose to aggregate the Licensee's violation in failing to control licensed material with its root cause (failure
to survey_Violation I.A) as well as the effect of the violation (the creation of radiation levels in excess of that
allowed in NRC regulations_Violation I.C) since the three violations were all related to the one incident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In view of the above, the assertion that Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C were classified in the aggregate at Severity Level
III because they represent a programmatic breakdown is incorrect. In addition, the Licensee's contention regarding
corrective action, involving the prompt location and recovery of the source are not controlling in determining the
severity level of the violation. The severity level is determined by the safety or regulatory significance of the
violation. The Licensee's request for mitigation of the civil penalty is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, the violations were properly classified in the aggregate as a Severity Level III problem.

II.A. 10 CFR 35.32(a) requires, in part, that each licensee shall establish and maintain a written quality management
program to provide high confidence that byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material will be administered
as directed by the authorized user. Pursuant to 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4), the quality management program must include written
policies and procedures to meet the objective that each administration is in accordance with the written directive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contrary to the above, as of November 30, 1992, the licensee's quality management program did not include written
policies and procedures to meet the objective that each administration was in accordance with the written directive.
In particular, the licensee did not establish written procedures to identify if a brachytherapy source was not properly
implanted or inadequately secured against accidental removal. As a result, on November 30, 1992, during a therapy
procedure that involved a gynecological implant of four cesium-137 sources, one source was either not implanted
as required or it was implanted properly but inadequately secured because the source came out of the applicator and
lay undetected in the patient's bed. As a result, the dose administered to the patient was less than that prescribed
by the physician and the patient received a radiation dose to the leg, an area not intended to receive radiation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4) requires, in part, that each licensee shall establish and maintain a written quality management
program to provide high confidence that byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material will be administered
as directed by the authorized user. The quality management program must include written policies and procedures
to meet the specific objective that each administration is in accordance with the written directive.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 27, 1992, the licensee implemented a quality management program for the use of byproduct material. Section
3 of the quality management program entitled ``Policies and Procedures for Brachytherapy'', paragraph 3.1.3 of
the ``High Dose Rate Remote Afterloading Devices'', requires, in part, that the treatment site be confirmed with
the written directive and treatment plan by the administering person before administration of the treatment dose.

Contrary to the above, on January 21, 1993, the authorized user physician failed to follow the quality management
program in that during a brachytherapy patient treatment with a high dose rate remote afterloader, the treatment
site was not confirmed by the authorized user physician, causing the patient to receive 700 rads to the rectum, instead

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its response, the Licensee denies that it violated the requirement to establish and maintain a written QMP, noting
that it established a written QMP based upon the NRC's own guidance published in Regulatory Guide 8.33 on January 27,
1992, and as required by 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4). The Licensee further states that the written quality management policy
and procedures were distributed to all authorized users for comment on January 21, 1992, and no comments were received
from the authorized users on this final version, and the same version was presented to NRC Region I in a letter dated
January 27, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Licensee also notes that in addition to giving each authorized user a copy of the written quality management policy
and procedures, the radiation safety officer conducted formal training for the members of the radiation therapy
staff on March 5, 1992, detailing the requirements of the QMP, and both physicians involved in the alleged violations
attended this presentation. The Licensee further states that both physicians understood that the written directive
needed to be verified during the application process. Nonetheless, despite the existence of a comprehensive QMP
and related training, these events occurred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the first incident, the Licensee also states that the resident physician followed the established
procedures and, therefore, reasonably concluded that he had successfully placed the sources in the applicator during
the loading process, and he and the dosimetrist identified the correct sources as they were moved from the transportation
shield. The Licensee stated that in the process of moving one of the four sources and its applicator to the patient,
the source inadvertently slipped unnoticed from the applicator, and that since the resident missed the source in
its fall under the patient, he had no opportunity to identify the error once the applicator was placed into the Fletcher
Suit Device (FSD). Since the resident wholly believed he had fulfilled the written directive, the Licensee submits
that he had satisfied the requirements of the QMP regardless of his error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the second incident involving the High Dose Rate Afterloading (HDR) device, the Licensee states that
the physician who prepared the written directive was the same physician who placed the applicator in error. Since
he was the prescribing physician, the Licensee contends that there is no doubt that he understood the intent of the
written directive. The Licensee states that while the physician did not visually confirm or verify the placement,
he fully believed that he had correctly placed the applicator, based on his sense of touch during the physical examination,
knowledge of anatomy, the feel and depth of the applicator insertion, and by asking the patient if she felt comfortable
after the placement. Since the physician fully believed that he had carried out the written directive, the Licensee
submits that it had fulfilled the requirements of the QMP notwithstanding his error.

The NRC does not dispute, in general, that the Licensee established and maintained a QMP, or that it provided training
to authorized users. However, with respect to the first incident, the NRC maintains that the Licensee's QMP did not
include written policies and procedures to provide high confidence that the QMP would meet the objective that each
brachytherapy administration is in accordance with the written directive. 10 CFR 35.32(a) requires, in part, that
each licensee shall establish and maintain these written policies and procedures to provide high confidence that
the radiation from byproduct material will be administered as directed by the authorized user. Therefore, it is incumbent
upon the Licensee to establish written procedures that provide high confidence in the delivery process of therapeutic
radiation and the accurate administration of the prescribed dose. In this case, the Licensee did not establish adequate
written procedures, as required, to effectively implement their QMP and procedures to verify whether brachytherapy
sources were properly inserted in accordance with the written directive. In particular, the QMP was inadequate in
that it did not require visual or other verification of proper insertion of the sources while they were being inserted.
The Licensee stated that it established a QMP based on requirements in 10 CFR 35.32. 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4) requires that
each administration be in accordance with the written directive. The licensee's QMP did require that a means be employed
of verifying sources are positioned properly. However, the licensee had not established such a procedure to meet
this objective by directing the physician to verify proper insertion of the source or sources (e.g., by visual inspection).
In this instance, visual verification of the sources in the applicator would have been an acceptable means. The QMP
did not have any procedure to ensure, nor did the physician confirm, that the administration of the dose was in accordance
with the written directive. Therefore, the QMP did not provide high confidence that radiation from byproduct material
would be administered as directed pursuant to 10 CFR 35.32(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the second incident, although the authorized user fully understood the intent of the written directive,
the individual did not confirm or verify the proper placement of the applicator, which had not been placed into the
correct organ, with the treatment site specified in the written directive and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 treatment plan. The Licensee stated that it established a QMP based on requirements in 10 CFR 35.32. 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4)
requires that each administration be in accordance with the written directive but did not describe how this should
be done. The licensee's QMP did require the treatment site be confirmed with the written directive. Visual verification
of the source insertion into the proper organ would have been an acceptable means. As in violation IIA, the QMP appears
inadequate in that it did not require visual or another specific procedure for verification of proper insertion of
the sources while they were being inserted. The QMP did not have any specific procedure to ensure, nor did the physician
confirm, that the administration of the dose was in accordance with the written directive. Therefore, the QMP did
not provide high confidence that radiation from byproduct material would be administered as directed pursuant to
10 CFR 35.32(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC realizes that confirmation of a treatment site by the Licensee may be accomplished in a number of ways. However,
it is the responsibility of the Licensee to establish effective procedures to meet the performance-based objective
of the QMP required by 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4), and provide high confidence that the intended therapeutic radiation is
administered to the designated treatment site as prescribed by the physician authorized user. In this case, simple
visual confirmation could have prevented the error and would have provided higher confidence than the physician's
method of feeling to locate the treatment site.

As demonstrated by the authorized user's failure to treat the prescribed treatment site, the Licensee did not meet
the objective in 10 CFR 35.32(a)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC agrees that the Licensee had a QMP and that the physician understood the intent of the written directive. The
NRC has determined, however, that the procedures may have been inadequate in that the physician did not adequately
confirm (or verify) the placement of the applicator and that the QMP procedure for confirmation (or verification)
is vague and does not provide high confidence that the objective will be met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the NRC maintains that with regard to both incidents, violations of the QMP occurred.

Summary of Licensee Response Requesting Mitigation of the Civil Penalties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As a general comment to violations identified in Sections I and II of the Notice, the Licensee contends that the civil
penalties should be reduced, noting that it has voluntarily conducted an independent, formal, and comprehensive
review of the hospital's radiation safety program, and a panel of four experts conducted the review on May 10 and 11,
1993. The Licensee also notes, as evidenced by this formal review program, and other comprehensive measures detailed
in its incident reports dated December 22, 1992, January 4, 1993, and February 5, 1993, that it is committing significant
management and fiscal resources to address the concerns expressed in the enforcement action. The Licensee believes
that the remedial actions that the NRC seeks to encourage will be realized without the need for stringent enforcement
in the form of proposed civil penalties, and that this is consistent with the Enforcement Policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the violations in Section I, as stated above, the Licensee notes that the NRC letter stated that 100
percent escalation of the civil penalty was warranted based upon the hospital's past enforcement history. Since
the letter makes reference to an incident which occurred in 1989, the Licensee questions consideration of that action
since the NRC's Enforcement Policy indicates that a licensee's prior performance normally refers to a period within
the last two years of the inspection at issue, or the period within the last two inspections, whichever is longer. Since
this license is a broad scope license that is inspected on a yearly interval, the Licensee believes it is contrary to
established NRC practice to cite an incident occurring more than three and a half years ago as a basis for escalation
of the civil penalty. Further, since the NRC's current Enforcement Policy has been modified to provide for maximum
flexibility and consideration of all mitigating circumstances, the Licensee requests that the NRC exercise its
discretion to reduce the civil penalty associated with the violations in Section I of the NOV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the violations in Section II, the Licensee states that the NRC's cover letter to the NOV indicates that
all of the adjustment factors set forth in 10 CFR Part 2, Appendix C, were considered. Although the NRC increased the
base civil penalty by 200 percent for ``past enforcement history and multiple examples,'' and concluded that the
remaining factors warranted no further adjustment, the Licensee believes that, upon closer examination of the circumstances,
mitigation is warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the ``multiple examples'' adjustment factor, the Licensee notes that the NRC's Enforcement Policy makes
it explicitly clear that for this factor to be applicable, the multiple occurrences should have the ``same root causes.''
The Licensee contends that while the NRC indicated that the root cause of the two incidents was inattention to detail
by the treating physicians, this is not the root cause of the cited violations. The Licensee notes that the NOV states
that the root cause of Violation II.A was failure to have an adequate procedure in place consistent with the program
requirements in 10 CFR 35.32, whereas the second violation, II.B, is stated by the NRC to arise from a different root
cause, namely, failure to follow an existing procedure established in conformance with the program requirements
of 10 CFR 35.32. The Licensee further states that the fact that these violations derive from different root causes
is reinforced by the fact that the specific corrective action for one violation would not necessarily have prevented
the other. Based on this information, the Licensee believes that escalation of the base civil penalty under the ``multiple
examples'' factor is inappropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the ``prior enforcement history'' adjustment factor, the Licensee believes that the application of this
factor was inappropriate in this case, noting that the Quality Management rule has become effective only recently,
and there has been no opportunity to develop an enforcement history for compliance with this rule. Just as the Enforcement
Policy recognizes that this factor should not be applied where the Licensee has not been in existence long enough to
establish a performance history, the Licensee contends that so too should this logic be applied in establishing performance
history for quality management violations. On this basis, the Licensee contends that escalation of the base civil
penalty is unwarranted.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Regarding the other factors, the Licensee believes that, on balance, the remaining adjustment factors warrant mitigation
even though none was applied. Regarding the ``identification'' factor, the Licensee notes that the current Enforcement
Policy streamlines the applicability of this factor to situations where the Licensee identified the violations
and promptly reported them to the NRC. The Licensee argues that, in both cases, following identification of the violation,
the hospital thoroughly evaluated the events and promptly provided the NRC with the results in letters to the NRC Region
I office, dated December 22, 1992, January 4, 1993, and February 5, 1993. Based on this information, the Licensee believes
that full mitigation on this factor is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the ``corrective action'' factor, once the violations were identified, the Licensee maintains it took
prompt action to bring the situations into compliance. Immediate corrective actions were implemented to assure
that fully safe conditions were restored and that further noncompliance with the NRC's requirements was halted.
In addition, as evidenced by the NRC's inspection report dated December 30, 1992, the Licensee maintains that it had
already developed proposed long-term corrective actions, ``at the time of the inspection,'' which was the day after
the incident was reported. Given this information, the Licensee believes that further mitigation due to this factor
is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Licensee maintains it had no prior opportunity to identify the two specific violations, neither misadministration
resulted in doses to the patients that exceeded the prescribed doses by more than 20 percent of the total prescribed
doses, nor are they believed to result in any significant detriment, and therefore, no escalation is warranted for
these factors. In summary, when the circumstances surrounding the violations are fully considered, the Licensee
submits that significant mitigation of the proposed civil penalty for Violation II is warranted.

NRC Evaluation of Licensee Response Requesting Mitigation of the Civil Penalties
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC has evaluated the Licensee response and has determined, as set forth below, that the Licensee has not provided
an adequate basis for any mitigation of the civil penalty. In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the NRC considered
the escalation and mitigation factors set forth in the NRC Enforcement Policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the issues provided in the Licensee's response as a basis for mitigation of the penalty, the NRC acknowledges
that the Licensee performed an independent assessment on May 10 and 11, 1993, to improve implementation of the radiation
safety program. However, this commitment was made only after these violations were identified by the NRC as a result
of inspections conducted on December 3 and 4, 1992, and January 26 and 27, 1993, at the Licensee's facility. Nevertheless,
the NRC mitigated the base civil penalty for corrective action for Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C by 50 percent, the maximum
recommended under the enforcement policy. No further mitigation is warranted under this factor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the violations in Section I, the Licensee states that the NRC, contrary to established practice in
Section VI.B.2.(c) of the Enforcement Policy, used an enforcement action which occurred in 1989 as part of its inspection
history to establish a basis for the 100 percent escalation of the civil penalty for licensee performance. The NRC
agrees that prior performance normally refers to the licensee's performance within the last two years of the inspection
at issue, or the period within the last two inspections, whichever is longer. However, Section VI.B.2.(c) also states
that the base civil penalty may be escalated by as much as 100 percent if the current violation is reflective of the licensee's
poor or declining prior performance. While the NRC did mention the escalated action issued in 1989 in its April 26,
1993, cover letter to the Notice of Violation, it also referred to an escalated action that was issued in 1992, which
is within the two year/two inspection period. Viewed collectively, the past enforcement actions demonstrate a declining
trend in performance at the Licensee's facility. Additionally, the escalated enforcement action issued in 1989
involved the Licensee's loss of control of a cesium-137 sealed source and subsequent improper disposal. The Licensee's
corrective action for this incident was not broad and lasting, and did not prevent recurrence of a similar violation
described in Section I of the Notice issued April 26, 1993, involving the loss of a cesium-137 brachytherapy sealed
source. Based on the above, the NRC believes that the 100 percent escalation for Licensee performances, was a proper
application of the Enforcement Policy in determining the civil penalty amount of $2500 for the violations in Section
I. As for the Licensee's contention regarding identification of Violations I.A, I.B, and I.C, the NRC in the Notice
proposed 50 percent mitigation, which is the maximum recommended under the enforcement policy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The escalation/mitigation factors for the violations in Section II were applied consistent with the Policy. Regarding
the ``multiple examples'' factor, the violations both involved the failure to meet the specific objective that each
administration is in accordance with the written directive. The QMP was inadequate in that it did not contain procedures
that provide high confidence in the delivery process of therapeutic radiation and the accurate administration of
the prescribed dose. The administering physician's inattention to detail was the root cause and primary contributing
reason for the occurrence of both misadministrations at the facility within a short period. In violation II.A, the
physician failed to observe that one of four sources fell into the patient's bed, while in violation II.B, the physician
failed to use any visual means to verify correct insertion of the sources. Had either physician paid adequate attention
while inserting the sources, or if the Licensee's QMP had provided specific procedures to verify correct source insertion,
these violations would likely have been averted. Therefore, based on the fact that both events were due to the same
root cause, escalation on this factor was warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the ``prior performance'' factor, while there is no history in the quality management area given its
recent implementation, the Licensee's poor and declining overall performance in the radiation safety area of the
medical program warrants escalation of the penalty on this factor, as set forth above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the ``identification'' factor, the NRC maintains that, while the two misadministrations were self disclosing,
the associated quality management violations were identified by the NRC. In both events, the Licensee did not identify
the failure of the QMP to include written policies and procedures to meet the objective that each brachytherapy administration
is verified to be to the proper treatment site in accordance with the respective written directive. In each case, the
NRC identified the failure to establish adequate written procedures to ensure the Licensee's proper placement of
brachytherapy source(s) at the prescribed treatment site. Therefore, on balance, no adjustment by the NRC on this
factor was warranted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the ``corrective action'' factor, the actions taken in response to these violations were not considered
sufficiently prompt and comprehensive to warrant mitigation because they were initially narrowly focused on the
specific events, rather than on root causes, the QMP and improvements necessary to increase management oversight.
The Licensee did implement additional training and instruction in the loading and placement of brachytherapy sources
and applicators. However, the Licensee did not perform an extensive and comprehensive root cause analysis of the
two misadministrations. The corrective actions were narrowly focused and primarily directed at the performance
of visual checks and examinations of the sources and applicators before implantation. The corrective actions did
not include a comprehensive review of the QMP procedures to determine what written modifications might be necessary
to ensure compliance with the failed objective and program areas of concern. Additionally, the corrective actions
failed to address what changes in management oversight and involvement would be incorporated into the Licensee's
QMP to prevent recurrence of similar events and improve supervision of brachytherapy activities. Following the
second event and discussions with NRC, a more comprehensive approach was adopted. However, on balance, no adjustment
on this factor is warranted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC concludes that the Licensee has not provided an adequate basis for mitigating any portion of the civil penalties.
Accordingly, the NRC has determined that monetary civil penalties in the amount of $10,000 should be imposed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Public Law 97-415, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC staff) is publishing
this regular biweekly notice. Public Law 97-415 revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the
Act), to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, or proposed to be issued, under a new provision
of section 189 of the Act. This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediately effective
any amendment to an operating license upon a determination by the Commission that such amendment involves no significant
hazards consideration, notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearing from any person.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposed to be issued from December 13, 1993, through
December 22, 1993. The last biweekly notice was published on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67840).

Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses, Proposed No Significant Hazards
Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendment requests involve no significant hazards
consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance
with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an
accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination
for each amendment request is shown below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received before action is taken.
Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda,
Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requests for a hearing
and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By February 4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified
in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensees have provided their analysis about the issue of no significant hazards
consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The proposed changes would not involve an increase in the probability or the consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change only allows flexibility in the scheduling of the three required Type A tests in the
10-year service period. The additional flexibility is needed for plants using 18-month fuel cycles to allow refueling
outages and testing intervals to coincide. There is no change to the number of tests required, test methodology, or
acceptance criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The proposed changes would not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed change to the test schedule only provides flexibility in meeting the same requirement for
three tests in a 10-year period. The testing type and bases have not changed. Therefore, operation of the units with
this more flexible test schedule will not result in an accident previously not analyzed in the Updated Final Safety
Analysis Report (UFSAR). The proposed changes do not impact the design bases of the containment and do not modify the
response of the containment during a design basis accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed changes would not involve a reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed changes to the schedule
only provides flexibility in meeting the same requirement for three tests in a 10-year period. These proposed changes
do not affect or change any limiting conditions for operation (LCO), or any other surveillance requirements in the
TS, and the basis for the surveillance requirement remains unchanged. The testing method, acceptance criteria,
and bases are not changed. The TS continue to require testing that is consistent with the requirements of Appendix
J to 10 CFR 50.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' analysis and, based on that review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment requests involve no significant
hazards consideration.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would permit extending the time to perform leak rate testing of certain containment isolation
valves so that the testing can be performed during the refueling outage scheduled to start April 16, 1994, rather than
requiring an earlier shutdown solely to perform the testing. The proposed amendment would revise Surveillance Requirements
4.6.1.3d and 4.6.1.3f to allow a one-time extension of the surveillance intervals for leak rate testing of containment
isolation valves. In addition, the proposed amendment would revise Surveillance Requirements 4.4.3.2.2a and 4.4.3.2.2b,
replacing the requirement to leak test the reactor coolant pressure isolation valves every 18 months or prior to returning
a valve to service, with a requirement to leak test the valves in accordance with the Inservice Testing Program. This
would allow the testing to be performed during the fifth refueling outage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis against the standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c). The NRC staff's review
is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proposed changes would not significantly increase the probability or consequences of a previously evaluated
accident. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the proposed technical specification (TS) changes requests a one-time only extension of the surveillance
intervals for the TS Surveillance Requirements of TS 4.6.1.3f, leak rate testing of valves sealed by the main steam
positive leakage control system (MS-PLCS) and the penetration valve leakage control system (PVLCS). The revision
would permit eleven containment isolation valves to be tested a maximum of 46 days later than required by current technical
specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To permit the one-time extension of the surveillance interval for leak rate tests of containment isolation valves,
TS 4.6.1.3d must also be revised to permit the interval for Type C leak rate tests to exceed 24 months. This change is
consistent with an associated exemption request. The exemption request and this revision would permit 20 valves
to be tested a maximum of 35 days later than required by the current technical specifications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would also revise Surveillance Requirements 4.4.3.2.2a and 4.4.3.2.2b, replacing the requirement
to leak test the reactor coolant pressure isolation valves every 18 months or prior to returning a valve to service,
with a requirement to leak test the valves in accordance with the Inservice Testing Program. This change would require
that the pressure isolation valves be tested in accordance with Section XI of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code,
resulting in the valves being tested at least every refueling outage, rather than specifying an 18 month cycle. The
revision would permit five valves to be tested a maximum of 65 days later than allowed under the current technical specification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the short duration of the requested extensions, the extensions will not significantly increase the probability
or consequences of a previously evaluated accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes permit extension of the surveillance intervals for leak rate testing of containment isolation
valves and reactor coolant system pressure isolation valves. In that the requested extension durations are small
as compared to the overall interval allowed by TS, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes would not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes permit extension of the surveillance intervals for leak rate testing of containment isolation
valves and reactor coolant system pressure isolation valves. In that the requested extension durations are small
as compared to the overall interval allowed by TS, the proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in the
margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff
proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change corrects Technical Specification pages issued for Amendment 166 for
Brunswick Unit 1 and Amendment 197 for Brunswick Unit 2, regarding NUMAC Steam Leak Detection Equipment. Specifically,
on page 3/4 3-29 for each unit, the Channel Calibration frequency of Item 4.a.4, HPCI [High Pressure Core Injection]
Steam Line Tunnel Temperature - High, was inadvertently left as quarterly (Q) rather than being revised to refuel
(R). The text of CP&amp;L's September 14, 1992 license amendment request and the NRC's safety evaluation for Amendments
166 and 197, dated October 14, 1993, addressed the frequency change from quarterly to refuel for this item. Therefore,
the proposed change is purely administrative in nature and can not involve a significant increase in the probability
of consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. As stated above, the NRC's safety evaluation for Amendments 166 and 197, dated October 14, 1993, addressed
the frequency change from quarterly to refuel for Item 4.a.4 of Table 4.3.2-1, HPCI Steam Line Tunnel Temperature
- High. Therefore, the proposed change is purely administrative in nature and can not create the possibility of a new
or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. The proposed change
corrects Technical Specification pages issued for Amendment 166 for Brunswick Unit 1 and Amendment 197 for Brunswick
Unit 2, regarding NUMAC Steam Leak Detection Equipment. The NRC's safety evaluation for Amendments 166 and 197, dated
October 14, 1993, addressed the change of Channel Calibration frequency of Item 4.a.4, HPCI Steam Line Tunnel Temperature
- High from quarterly (Q) to refuel (R). Therefore, the proposed change is purely administrative and can not involve
a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed change would modify the Technical Specifications incorporated in Facility Operating License No.
DPR-45 in accordance with the requirements of the revised 10 CFR Part 20 which becomes mandatory January 1, 1994 (56
FR 23360). In addition, this proposed change would correct several editorial oversights from previous amendments.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee provided the results of its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards
consideration. The NRC staff has reviewed the information provided by the licensee and found that the licensee did
not provide specific information as to how it determined that the three standards of 50.92(c) were satisfied. The
NRC staff performed its own evaluation of the proposed change to determine if the three standards of 50.92(c) were
satisfied. The NRC staff's no significant hazards consideration evaluation is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is to bring the LACBWR Technical Specifications into conformance with the revised 10 CFR Part
20 and to correct several editorial oversights previously evaluated. The proposed change has no affect on any plant
operating parameters. Consequently, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change create the possibility of a new or different kind
of accident from any previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is to bring the LACBWR Technical Specifications into conformance with the revised 10 CFR Part
20 and to correct several editorial oversights previously evaluated. The proposed change is administrative in nature.
Further, the proposed change does not result in any physical alteration to any plant system, and does not result in
any change in the method by which any safety-related system performs its function. Consequently, the proposed change
does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Will operation of the facility according to this proposed change involve a significant reduction in a margin of
safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety is the difference between the value of a critical design, operating, or post accident parameter,
and the value of the parameter which would produce unacceptable results. The proposed change does not affect any hardware,
has no effect on the current operating methodologies or actions which govern plant performance, and does not affect
any accident analysis parameter. Consequently, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in
a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has determined based on its own no significant hazards consideration evaluation that the three standards
of 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no
significant hazards consideration.

The Waterford 3 Type A test history provides substantial justification for the proposed test schedule. Three type

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no structural mechanisms which would adversely affect the structural capability of the containment and
that would be a factor in extending the Type A test schedule to ten years. A risk impact assessment was performed, and
a determination was made that there is no risk impact as a result of changing the Type A test schedule. Therefore, the
proposed change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no design changes being made that would create a new type of accident or malfunction. The proposed change
will not alter the plant or the manner in which it is operated. The change proposes a change to the schedule for performing
the periodic Type A test. The purpose of the test is to provide periodic verification by test of the leaktight integrity
of the primary reactor containment, and systems and components which penetrate containment. The tests assure that
leakage through containment and systems and components penetrating containment will not exceed the allowable leakage
rate values associated with conditions resulting from an accident. The change in schedule for performing the Type
A test will not adversely affect the containment integrity in the event of an accident. Therefore, the proposed change
will not create the possibility of a new or different type of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change is a change to the schedule for performing the periodic Type A tests and does not reduce the margin
of safety assumed in accident analysis for release of radioactive materials from the containment atmosphere into
the environment or any margin of safety preserved by the Technical Specifications. The methodology, acceptance
criteria, and the technical specification leakage limits for the performance of the Type A tests will not change,
and the Type A tests will be performed in accordance with 10CFR 50, Appendix J, and the Waterford 3 licensing basis.
Therefore, the proposed change will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise the Technical Specifications (TSs) to provide acceptable conditions for operation
when (1) the core operating limits supervisory system (COLSS) is in service and neither control element assembly
calculator (CEAC) is operable and (2) the COLSS is out of service and either or both CEACs are operable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed TS change modifies the departure from nucleate boiling ratio (DNBR) margin, Limiting Condition for
Operation (LCO) 3.2.4b and c, which limits the core power distribution to the initial value assumed in the accident
analyses. Operation within this LCO either limits or prevents potential fuel cladding failures in the event of a postulated
accident and limits damage to the fuel cladding during an accident by ensuring that the plant is operating within acceptable
conditions at the onset of a transient. The limiting safety system settings and this LCO are based on the accident analysis,
so that specified acceptable fuel design limits (SAFDLs) are not exceeded as a result of anticipated operational
occurrences (AOOs) and the limits of acceptable consequences are not exceeded for other postulated accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The COLSS and core protection calculators (CPCs) monitor the core power distribution on line and are capable of verifying
that the linear heat rate (LHR) and DNBR do not exceed their limits. The COLSS performs this function by continuously
monitoring the core power distribution and calculating core power operating limits corresponding to the allowable
peak LHR and DNBR. The CPCs perform this function by continuously calculating an actual value of DNBR and LHR for comparison
with the respective trip setpoints. CEACs monitor CEA position. Should a CEA deviate from its subgroup position,
the CEACs will transmit an appropriate ``penalty'' factor to the CPCs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The COLSS is normally used to monitor DNBR margin. When at least one CEAC is operable, TS 3.2.4a provides enough margin
to DNB to accommodate the limiting AOO without failing the fuel. When neither CEAC is operable, the CPCs lack the CEA
position information necessary to ensure a reactor trip when necessary. In this case TS 3.2.4b requires the COLSS
calculated core power to be reduced to ensure that the limiting AOO will not result in fuel failure. Currently, TS 3.2.4b
requires that the COLSS calculated power be maintained at 13% below the COLSS calculated power operating limit to
compensate for the potential error in the CPC DNBR calculation. The proposed revision would increase this required
adjustment to 16%, which is more restrictive than the present value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In instances when the COLSS is out of service, but either or both CEACs are operable, TS 3.2.4c states that the DNBR operating
margin shall be maintained by comparing the DNBR indicated on any operable CPC channel with the allowable value from
TS Figure 3.2-2. Whenever the COLSS is out of service, the CPCs are used to perform the same monitoring function. However,
the extra conservatisms built into the CPCs for transient protection are not all required when the CPCs are being used
for monitoring. In order not to affect the CPC transient protection, these conservatisms are not taken from the CPC,
but are credited in the COLSS out-of-service limits in Figure 3.2-2. A reevaluation of the limiting AOOs has verified
that, by maintaining the margin in the proposed Figure 3.2-2, sufficient margin exists to ensure that the limiting
Cycle 7 AOO will not result in fuel failure.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For the case when neither CEAC is operable but COLSS is in service, the CPCs assume a preset CEA configuration and can
not obtain the required CEA position information to ensure the SAFDL on DNBR will not be violated during an AOO. Thus,
as a result of limiting AOOs for Cycle 7, Specification 3.2.4b requires that core power be reduced to a value 16% less
than the current COLSS calculated power operating limit. This ensures the limiting AOO will not result in a violation
of SAFDLs. The proposed revision to Figure 3.2-2 accounts for the situation when COLSS is out of service but at least
one CEAC is operable. In this case, the Cycle 7 safety analysis has shown that by maintaining the CPC calculated DNBR
above the value shown in the figure, the limiting AOO will not result in a violation of the SAFDLs. Therefore, the proposed
change will not significantly increase the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are primarily a result of changes in Cycle 7 core parameters. These changes do not involve any
change to any equipment or manner in which the plant will be operated. These changes further restrict the plant operation
when either COLSS or both CEACs are out of service. Therefore, the proposed change will not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intent of this Specification is to ensure that there is always sufficient margin to DNB such that the CPCs can mitigate
the consequences of the most limiting AOO prior to a violation of the SAFDLs. Generally, this margin is continuously
monitored by COLSS; however, if COLSS is out of service, but at least one CEAC is operable, the limitation on CPC calculated
DNBR (as a function of ASI [axial shape index]) shown in Figure 3.2-2 represents a conservative envelope of operating
conditions consistent with the Cycle 7 safety analysis assumptions. This band of operating conditions has been analytically
demonstrated to maintain an acceptable minimum DNBR through all AOOs. On the other hand, for the case when COLSS is
in service, but neither CEAC is operable, the proposed change will ensure that the limiting AOO will not result in a
violation of SAFDLs. Therefore, the proposed changes will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety.

The purpose of the request is to change the plant Technical Specifications (TS) to remove the limiting conditions

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in
the probability of occurrence or the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The TS requirements assured
the operability of the CDS in the event of an on-site chlorine release from a one ton cylinder. These TS requirements
reduced the probability and the consequences of a radiological accident which may result from an incapacitation
of control room operatorsafter entry of chlorine into the control room. With the removal and the restriction on delivery
of one ton chlorine cylinders, this postulated event is no longer credible, and there is a decrease in the probability
of a radiological accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new or
different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The TS requirements associated with the CDS were
for the on-site release of chlorine from a one ton cylinder. These cylinders are removed and prohibited from the TMI-1
site. These actions preclude a significant on-site release of chlorine which could affect the control room operators.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety. The purpose of the TS requirements was to maintain operability of the CDS in the event of on-site
release from a one ton chlorine cylinder. Since chlorine cylinders greater than 150 pounds are prohibited on-site,
the TS requirements for chlorine detection are no longer required, and their removal will not reduce the margin of
safety.

1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change seeks to eliminate the unnecessary testing of an operable Standby Diesel Generator (SDG). Technical
Specification (TS) 3.8.1.1 Actions a. and e. require all operable SDGs be started as a demonstration of operability
whenever one or more of the offsite AC [alternating current] power sources is declared inoperable. The inoperability
of an offsite AC power source has no effect on the reliability of a SDG. Deleting this requirement does not affect the
design or performance characteristics of the SDGs. Therefore, the SDGs maintain their ability to perform their design
function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TS 3.8.1.1 Actions b. and c. require all remaining operable SDGs be started as a demonstration of operability whenever
one of the SDG is declared inoperable except for preplanned preventive maintenance or testing. The proposed amendment
would expand the testing exclusion to include an inoperable support system and an independently testable component
in addition to preplanned preventive maintenance and testing. The proposed amendment would also eliminate the testing
requirement of the remaining operable SDGs, when a SDG is declared inoperable, unless there is cause to believe a potential
common mode failure exists for the remaining SDGs. The normal TS surveillance testing schedule assures that operable
SDG(s) are capable of performing their intended safety functions. A failure of one SDG does not reduce the reliability
of another, otherwise operable SDG. Deleting this requirement does not affect the design or performance characteristics
of the SDGs, once a common mode failure has been dismissed. Therefore, the SDGs maintain their ability to perform their
design function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The elimination of these unnecessary tests does not affect the design bases of the SDGs, or any of the accident evaluations
involving the SDGs. The SDGs are designed to provide electrical power to the equipment important for safety during
all modes and plant conditions following a loss of offsite power. The test schedule established in accordance with
GL 84-15 [``Proposed Staff Actions To Improve and Maintain Diesel Generator Reliability''] assures that operable
SDGs are capable of performing their intended safety function. Therefore, this change does not create the possibility
of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the proposed change does not affect the design bases, accident analysis, reliability or capability of the SDGs
to perform their intended safety function, this change does not involve any reduction in a margin to safety.

1. Operation of Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 in accordance with the proposed license amendment does not involve
a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Testing of model boiler specimens for free span tubing (no TSP restraint) at room temperature conditions shows burst
pressures in excess of 5000 psi for indications of ODSCC with voltage measurements as high as 19 volts. Burst testing
performed on pulled tubes from Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 with up to a 2.02 volt indication shows measured burst in excess
of 10,000 psi at room temperature. Correcting for the effects of temperature on material properties and minimum strength
levels (as the burst testing was done at room temperature), tube burst capability significantly exceeds the RG 1.121
criterion requiring the maintenance of a margin of 3 times normal operating pressure differential on tube burst.
The 3 times normal operating pressure differential for the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 steam generators corresponds
to 4275 psi. Based on the existing data base, this criterion is satisfied with 7/8
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; diameter tubing with bobbin coil indications with signal amplitudes less than 4.9 volts, regardless of the
indicated depth measurement. A 1.0 volt plugging criteria compares favorably with the structural limit considering
the previously calculated growth rates for ODSCC within the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 steam generators. Considering
a voltage increase of 0.4 volts, and adding a 20% NDE uncertainty of 0.20 volts (90% Cumulative Probability) to the
IPC of 1.0 volts results in an EOC voltage of approximately 1.6 volts for Cycle 14 operation. A 3.3 volt safety margins
implied (4.9 structural limit - 1.6 volt EOC - 3.3 volt margin). This EOC voltage compares favorably with the Structural
Limit of 4.9 volts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the voltage/burst correlation, the EOC structural limit is supported by a voltage of 4.9 volts. A 3.1 volt BOC repair
limit confirms the structural limit when 40% growth and 20% uncertainty are applied to the repair limit. This repair
limit will be applied for Cycle 14 IPC implementation to repair bobbin indication greater than 3.1 volts independent
of RPC confirmation of the indication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The conservatism of this repair limit is shown by the EOC 12 (Summer 1992) eddy current data. The overall average voltage
growth was determined to be only 2.2%, with a 12% average voltage growth for indications less than 0.75 volt BOC and
a 1% average voltage growth for indication >0.75 volt at the BOC. In addition, the Cycle 12 maximum observed voltage
increase was found to be 0.49 volts, and occurred in a tube initially &lt;1.0 BOC. In accordance with the technical
specification requirements, the applicability of Cycle 13 growth rates for Cycle 14 operation will be confirmed
prior to return to power of Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1. Similar large structural margins are anticipated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated previously, TSP proximity to the tubes will prevent tube burst during all plant conditions. Test data indicates
that tube burst cannot occur within the TSP, even for tubes which have 100% through-wall EDM notches, 0.75 inch long,
provided that the TSP is adjacent to the notched area. Therefore, a more realistic assessment of tube operability
should be performed against the RG 1.121 loading requirements during accidents SLB conditions, since the TSP has
the potential to deflect during blowdown following a main SLB, thereby uncovering the intersection. At the ASME Code
recommended faulted condition loading of 3657 psi (2560 psi/0.7) structural integrity is provided for bobbin voltage
indications of a minimum of 9.6 volts. The repair limit based on the structural limited conservative SLB conditions
would be 6.0 volts (compared to a 3.1 volt repair limit for a structural limit based on the 3[delta]P burst capability
voltage).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Only three indications of ODSCC have been reported to have operating leakage, and all three have been in European plants.
No field leakage has been reported at other plants from tubes with indications of a voltage level of under 7.7 volts
(from 3/4'' tubing). Relative to the expected leakage during accident condition loadings, it has been previously
established that a postulated main SLB outside of containment but upstream of the MSIV represents the most limiting
radiological condition relative to the IPC. In support of implementation of the IPC, it will be determined whether
the distribution of cracking indications at the TSP intersections at the EOC 14 are projected to be such that primary
to secondary leakage would result in site boundary doses within a small fraction of the 10 CFR 100 guidelines. The SLB
leakage rate calculation methodology prescribed in Section 3.3 of draft NUREG-1477 will be used to calculate EOC
14 leakage. Due to the relatively low voltage growth rates at Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 and the relatively small number
of indications affected by the IPC, SLB leakage prediction per draft NUREG-1477 is expected to be less than the acceptance
limit of 1.0 gpm in the faulted loop and far below the conservatively calculated SRP based allowable value of 120 gpm
in the faulted loop. The NRC leakage rate calculation methodology applies a 98% confidence limit on leakage that is
independent of voltage. This method for calculating SLB leakage is conservative as it assumes no correlations exists
between SLB leakage and bobbin probe voltage. Tube pull results from Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 indicate that tube wall
degradation of greater than 40% through-wall was detectable either by the bobbin or RPC probe. The tube with maximum
through-wall penetration of 56% (42% average) had a voltage of 2.02 volts. This indication also was the largest recorded
bobbin voltage from the EOC 12 eddy current data. All burst tested tube intersections had degradation depths of 40%
to 56 % (actual) deep and all were detected by both probes, with all bobbin voltage grater than or equal to 1.0. Since
the criteria requires the plugging of >1.0 volt bobbin indications with confirmed RPC calls, using the Cook Nuclear
Plant Unit 1 pulled tube destructive examination results, it is reasonable that no indications of degradation greater
than 40% to 56% deep with an ability to influence tube burst capability were left in service. Since the majority of the
EOC 14 indications at Cook Nuclear Unit 1 are expected to be below this level, the inclusion of all IPC intersections
into the leakage calculation is exceptionally conservative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, as re-implementation of the 1.0 volt IPC during Cycle 14 does not adversely affect steam generator tube
integrity and results in acceptable dose consequences, the proposed amendment does not result in any increase in
the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated within the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 FSAR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementation of the proposed steam generator tube IPC does not introduce any significant changes to the plant design
basis. Use of the criteria does not provide a mechanism which could result in a tube rupture outside of the region of
the TSP elevations; no ODSCC is occurring outside the thickness of the TSPs. Neither a single or multiple tube rupture
event would be expected in a steam generator in which the plugging criteria has been applied (during all plant conditions).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, Cook Nuclear Plant will continue to implement a maximum leakage rate limit of 150 gpd (0.1 gpm) per steam
generator to help preclude the potential for excessive leakage during all plant conditions. The Cycle 14 Technical
Specification limits on primary to secondary leakage at operating conditions is a maximum of 0.4 gpm (600 gpd) for
all steam generators, or, a maximum of 150 gpd for any one steam generator. The RG 1.121 criterion for establishing
operational leakage rate limits that require plant shutdown are based upon leaks-before-break consideration to
detect a free span crack before potential tube rupture. The 150 gpd limit should provide for leakage detection and
plant shutdown in the event of the occurrence of an unexpected single crack resulting in leakage that is associated
with the longest permissible crack length. RG 1.121 acceptance criteria for establishing operating leakage limits
are based on leak-before-break considerations such that plant shutdown is initiated if the leakage associated with
the longest permissible crack is exceeded. The longest permissible crack is the length that provides a safety factor
of 3 against bursting at normal operating pressure differential. A voltage amplitude of 4.9 volts for typical ODSCC
corresponds to meeting this tube burst requirement at a lower 95% prediction limit on the burst correlation coupled
with 95/95 LTL material properties. Alternate crack morphologies can correspond to 4.9 volts so that a unique crack
length is not defied by the burst pressure versus voltage correlation. Consequently, typical burst pressure versus
through-wall crack length correlations are used below to define the ``longest permissible crack'' for evaluating
operating leakage limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At current plant conditions, the single through-wall crack lengths that result in tube burst at 3 times normal operating
pressure differential and SLB conditions are 0.44 inch and 0.84 inch, respectively. A leak rate of 150 gpd will provide
for detection of 0.42 inch long cracks at nominal leak rates and 0.61 inch long cracks at the lower 95% confidence level
leak rates. Since tube burst is precluded during normal operation due to the proximity of the TSP to the tube and the
potential for the crevice to become uncovered during SLB conditions, the leakage from the maximum permissible crack
must preclude tube burst at SLB conditions. Thus, the 150 gpd limit provides for plant shutdown prior to reaching critical
crack lengths for SLB conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant reduction in margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of the voltage based bobbin probe interim TSP elevation plugging criteria at Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 is demonstrated
to maintain steam generator tube integrity commensurate with the criteria of Regulatory Guide 1.121. RG 1.121 describes
a method acceptable to the NRC staff for meeting GDCs 14, 15, 31, and 32 by reducing the probability or the consequences
of steam generator tube rupture. This is accomplished by determining the limiting conditions of degradation of steam
generator tubing, as established by inservice inspection, for which tubes with unacceptable cracking should be
removed from service. Upon implementation of the criteria, even under the worst case conditions, the occurrence
of ODSCC at the TSP elevations is not expected to lead to a steam generator tube rupture event during normal or faulted
plant conditions. The EOC 14 distribution of crack indications at the TSP elevations will be confirmed to result in
acceptable primary to secondary leakage during all plant conditions and that radiological consequences are not
adversely impacted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addressing the combined effects of LOCA + SSE on the steam generator component (as required by GDC 2), it has been
determined that tube collapse may occur in the steam generators at some plants. This is the case as the TSPs may become
deformed as a result of lateral loads at the wedge supports at the periphery of the plant due to the combined effects
of the LOCA rarefaction wave and SSE loadings. Then, the resulting pressure differential on the deformed tubes may
cause some of the tubes to collapse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two issues associated with steam generator tube collapse. First, the collapse of steam generator tubing
reduces the RCS flow area through the tubes. The reduction in flow are increases the resistance to flow of steam from
the core during a LOCA which, in turn, may potentially increase peak clad temperature (PCT). Second, there is a potential
that partial through-wall cracks in tubes could progress to through-wall cracks during tube deformation or collapse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, since the leak-before-break methodology is applicable to the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 reactor coolant
loop piping, the probability of breaks in the primary loop piping is sufficiently low that they need not be considered
in the structural design of the plant. The limiting LOCA event becomes either the accumulator line brake or the pressurizer
surge line break. LOCA loads for the primary pipe breaks were used to bound the Cook Nuclear Plant Unit 1 smaller breaks.
The results of the analysis using the larger break inputs show that the LOCA loads were found to be of insufficient magnitude
to result in steam generator tube collapse or significant deformation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Addressing RG 1.83 consideration, implementation of the bobbin probe voltage based interim tube plugging criteria
of 1.0 volt is supplemented by the following: enhanced eddy current inspection guidelines to proved consistency
in voltage normalization, a 100% eddy current inspection sample size at the TSP elevations, and RPC inspection requirements
as outlined in the technical specifications and Appendix A ``NDE Data Acquisition and Analysis Guidelines'' (Attachment
6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted previously, implementation of the TSP elevation plugging criteria will decrease the number of tubes which
must be repaired. The installation of steam generator tube plugs reduce the RCS flow margin. Thus, implementation
of the alternate plugging criteria will maintain the margin of flow that would otherwise be reduced in the event of
increased tube plugging.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the above, it is concluded that the proposed license amendment request does not result in a significant reduction
in margin with respect to plant safety as defined in the Final Safety Analysis Report or any of the plant Technical Specifications.

The proposed amendments delete certain Limiting Conditions for Operation, Actions, and Surveillance Requirements
for Reactor Coolant System Pressure Isolation Valves in the Technical Specifications. The Technical Specifications
for these Reactor Coolant System Pressure Isolation Valves were added by Order dated April 20, 1981. This Order was
prompted by concerns for an interfacing system loss-of-coolant accident as identified in the Reactor Safety Study
(WASH-1400). The proposed Technical Specification change, by inference, also requests rescission of the April

which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Per 10 CFR 50.92, a proposed amendment to an operating license will not involve a significant hazards consideration
if the proposed amendment satisfies the following three criteria:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from an accident previously analyzed or evaluated,
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Criterion 1
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ISLOCA is not one of the accidents previously analyzed in Chapter 14, Safety Analysis, of the Cook Nuclear Plant
Updated Final Safety Analysis Report. Chapter 14 analyzes the large break LOCA in Section 14.3.1, and ``loss of reactor
coolant from small ruptured pipes or from cracks in large pipes which actuates the ECCS'', or small break LOCA in Section
14.3.2. Therefore, deleting from the Technical Specifications the Reactor Coolant System pressure isolation valves
in Table 3.4-0, will not increase the probability or the consequences of the large break or the small break LOCAs previously
analyzed for the Cook Nuclear Plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 2
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Reactor Coolant System pressure isolation valves in Table 3.4-0 of the Technical Specifications were added because
WASH-1400 identified the ISLOCA as a significant contributor to core damage frequency. Deletion of the subject valves
from the Technical Specifications and reliance on the testing requirements mandated by the In-Service Testing Program
of ASME XI does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from the large break or the small break
LOCAs previously analyzed for the Cook Nuclear Plant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Criterion 3
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deleting the Reactor Coolant System pressure isolation valves from the testing requirements in Table 3.4-0 of the
Technical Specifications will result in these valves only being tested on a refueling outage frequency as part of
the ASME B&amp;PV Code Section XI IST Program. This somewhat reduced testing frequency will result in a slight increase
in the ISLOCA contribution to core damage frequency of 5.4%, from lower 5.00E-08/reactor year to mid 5.00E-08/reactor
year. This insignificant increase will not affect the overall core damage frequency of 6.26E-05/reactor year. Therefore,
it is concluded that the proposed deletion of the Reactor Coolant System pressure isolation valves in Table 3.4-0
of the Technical Specifications, as well as the proposed deletion of the portions of the Technical Specifications
that are affected by Table 3.4-0, will not result in a significant reduction in the margin of safety that exists at Cook
Nuclear Plant to prevent an ISLOCA or to mitigate the consequences of an ISLOCA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. Does the change involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A change to the defined restricted area has no affect on any plant operating parameters. Consequently, a change to
the defined restricted area will not affect the probability or consequences of an accident occurring.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Does the change create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to the HBPP TS are administrative in nature. Further, the proposed changes would not result
in any physical alteration to any plant system, and there would not be a change in the method by which any safety-related
system performs its function.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Does the change involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revisions to the HBPP TS do not affect the margin of safety of any accident analysis since they do not affect
the parameters for any accident analysis, and have no effect on the current operating methodologies or actions which
govern plant performance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed Technical Specification (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes involve eliminating the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitoring (MSLRM) system high radiation
trip function for initiating an automatic reactor scram and automatic closure of the Main Steam Line Isolation Valves
(MSIVs), Main Steam line drain valves, and Main Steam and Reactor Water sample line valves. The proposed TS changes
support installation of a plant modification to defeat portions of MSLRM system high radiation trip function logic
circuitry in the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and Primary Containment and Reactor Vessel Isolation Control System
(PCRVICS). Installation of this modification will not adversely impact the operation of the RPS or PCRVICS with respect
to performing its other intended safety functions. The proposed TS changes will not affect the operation of other
plant systems or equipment important to safety. The MSLRM system high radiation trip function for the Mechanical
Vacuum Pump (MVP) will be retained. The safety assessment and justification for eliminating the MSLRM system high
radiation trip function for initiating an automatic reactor scram and automatic closure of the MSIVs [are] based
on General Electric's (GE's) Topical Report NEDO-31400A, ``Safety Evaluation for Eliminating the Boiling Water
Reactor Main Steam Line Isolation Valve Closure Function and Scram Function of the Main Steam Line Radiation Monitor,''
and the applicability of this report to Limerick Generating Station (LGS), Units 1 and 2. By letter dated May 15, 1991,
the NRC approved this topical report and indicated that it was acceptable for licensees to reference this report as
the basis for requesting a TS change to eliminate the MSLRM system high radiation trip functions as documented in the
report and associated NRC Safety Evaluation Report (SER). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety assessment provided in NEDO-31400A can also be applied to eliminate the MSLRM system high radiation trip
function for initiating the automatic closure of the Main Steam line drain valves although this aspect was not explicitly
evaluated in NEDO-31400A. The flow from these valves ultimately discharges to the main condenser as do the MSIVs and
therefore, any radioactive material passing through these valves would be processed in the same fashion as that passing
through the MSIVs. The effects of eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for initiating the closure
of the Main Steam and Reactor Water sample line valves is [are] negligible. The sample lines are routed to a sample sink
where inlet valves installed on the sample lines are normally closed. Additionally, downstream of the inlet valves
are needle valves designed to control and limit sample line flow. The sample sink is enclosed, and air vented from its
exhaust hood is passed through filters prior to release to the environment. There is the potential that a minimal amount
of radioactive material could be released to the environment if the sample sink inlet and needle valves failed to properly
function. This potential release has been evaluated and determined to a small fraction of the dose limit requirements
specified in 10 CFR 100.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MSLRM system high radiation trip was intended to function in response to a Control Rod Drop Accident (CRDA), a Design
Basis Accident previously evaluated. Although the CRDA assumes MSIV closure, no credit was taken for this in the CRDA
analysis since it postulates that the radioactive material calculated to be released from the fuel is transported
to the main condenser prior to the MSIVs completely closing. Furthermore, the probability of a fuel failure is independent
of the operation of the MSLRM system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Steam Jet Air Ejectors (SJAEs) will continue to operate to remove non-condensable gases from the main condenser
for processing by the Offgas Treatment system. The Offgas Treatment system will continue to function as designed
to reduce offgas radioactivity levels prior to release to the environment. Eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation
isolation functions will improve operational flexibility in that the main condenser will be available to aid in decay
heat removal. Elimination of the MSLRM system high radiation trip functions in conjunction with proper operation
of the Offgas Treatment system will ensure that any radioactive material released to the environment is a small fraction
of 10 CFR 100 limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes associated with eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for
initiating an automatic reactor scram and automatic closure of the MSIVs, Main Steam line drain valves, and Main Steam
and Reactor Water sample line valves do not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes involve eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for initiating an automatic
reactor scram and automatic closure of the MSIVs, Main Steam Line drain valves, and Main Steam and Reactor Water sample
line valves. The proposed TS changes will not affect the operation of other plant systems or equipment important to
safety. The associated plant modification simply defeats the MSLRM system high radiation trip function logic circuitry
in the RPS and PCRVICS. The RPS and PCRVICS will continue to respond in performing its other design intended safety
functions. The MSLRM system high radiation trip function for the MVP will be retained. The proposed TS changes do not
involve any plant hardware changes that could introduce any new failure modes or effects. The MSLRM system radiation
monitors will remain active to initiate Main Control Room (MCR) annunciation alarms. Plant procedures will be in
place to implement the appropriate mitigative measures in response to a MSLRM system high radiation alarm signal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SJAEs will continue to operate to remove non-condensable gases from the main condenser for processing by the Offgas
Treatment system. The Offgas Treatment system will continue to function as designed to reduce offgas radioactivity
levels prior to release to the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the Design Basis Accident analysis (i.e., CRDA) does not credit the MSLRM system high radiation trip function
for reducing the radiological consequences of the postulated accident, the proposed TS changes have effectively
been evaluated and are included in the existing analysis. That is, the CRDA analysis already assumes that the radioactive
material released from the failed fuel is immediately transported to the main condenser prior to the MSIVs completely
closing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety assessment and assumptions documents in GE Topical Report NEDO-31400A provide the basis for eliminating
the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for initiating an automatic reactor scram and automatic closure of
the MSIVs. The safety assessment provided in NEDO-31400A can also be applied to eliminate the MSLRM system high radiation
trip function for initiating the closure of the Main Steam Line drain valves, since any radioactive material passing
through these valves would be processed in the same fashion as that passing through the MSIVs. Eliminating the MSLRM
system high radiation trip function for initiating the closure of the Main Steam and Reactor Water sample line valves
will have a negligible impact. The sample lines are routed to a sample sink where inlet valves installed on the sample
lines are normally closed. Downstream of the inlet valves are needle valves designed to control and limit sample line
flow. The sample sink is located in the Reactor Enclosure and is enclosed, and air vented from its exhaust hood is passed
through filters prior to release to the environment. The Reactor Enclosure ventilation duct radiation monitor samples
air from the sample sink hood exhaust, and will isolate the Reactor Enclosure ventilation system if the radiation
levels exceed the monitor's setpoint. There is the potential that a minimal amount of radioactive material could
be released to the environment through this flowpath if the sample sink inlet and needle valves failed to properly
function. This potential release has been evaluated and determined to a small fraction of the dose limit requirements
specified in 10CFR100.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes to eliminate the MSLRM system high radiation trip function for initiating an automatic reactor
scram and automatic closure of the MSIVs, Main Steam line drains valves, and Main Steam and Reactor Water sample line
valves do not change the conclusion reached in the LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) that the calculated
radiological consequences of the bounding Design Basis Accident (i.e., CRDA) will not exceed the dose limit requirements
established by 10 CFR 100. The proposed TS changes will improve the overall reliability of the plant when compared
to the existing system lineup configuration, since it will reduce the potential of an unnecessary plant transient
occurring as a result of an inadvertent MSIV closure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A reliability assessment analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of eliminating the MSLRM system high radiation
reactor scram function on reactivity control failure frequency and core damage frequency in GE Topical Report NEDO-31400A.
This analysis indicated that there is a negligible increase in reactivity control frequency with the elimination
of the MSLRM trip function. However, this increase is compensated for by the reduction in transient initiating events
(i.e., inadvertent reactor scrams). This reduction in transient initiating events represents a reduction in core
damage frequency and thus, results in a net improvement in safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment would extend the surveillance interval of the primary containment drywell-to-suppression chamber
bypass leak test from the current 18-month interval as required by Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement
4.6.2.1.d to a 40 +/- 10-month interval. This change would allow the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass test
to coincide with the 10 CFR 50, Appendix J, Type A test (i.e., Containment Integrated Leakage Rate Test (CILRT)) interval.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or
consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The failure effects that are potentially created by the proposed Technical Specifications (TS) changes have been
considered. The accident which is potentially negatively impacted by the proposed TS changes are any Loss of Coolant
Accident (LOCA) inside primary containment with or without offsite power available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes increase the surveillance interval of the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test
required by TS Section 4.6.2.1.d, and will require that an additional test be performed on the downcomer vacuum breakers
assemblies. The primary containment structure and associated equipment are not considered to be accident initiators,
they act to mitigate the consequences of an accident. There are no physical or operational changes being made as a result
of these proposed changes. Therefore, the probability of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated is not increased.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a potential increased risk that an increase in the bypass leakage may go undetected for the duration of the
proposed extension of the interval between the performance of the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test.
However, as discussed below, the increased risk is considered to be negligible due to the design of the diaphragm structure
and past test data. Therefore, we have concluded that the probability of bypass leakage exceeding the allowed value
is not increased as a result of the proposed TS changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes will extend the surveillance interval for the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak
test from 18 months to 40 +/^ 10 months. These proposed changes would allow this test to be performed at the same interval
as the 10CFR50, Appendix J, Type A test (i.e., Containment Integrated Leakage Rate Test (CILRT)). In addition, the
proposed changes will add an additional surveillance requirement to be performed on the vacuum breaker assemblies
during refueling outages when the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test is not required to be performed.
The proposed TS changes do not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This is based on the
evaluation summarized below that demonstrates that the overall impact, if any, on the plant containment integrity
is negligible. Furthermore, the performance history for the previous LGS bypass leak tests does not indicate any
time based failures. The proposed TS changes also include a change to the frequency of testing, if two consecutive
tests fail, from once every nine (9) months to once every 24 months in order to coincide with the 24 month refueling cycle.
This change has no impact on the consequences of an accident based on maintaining the original requirement to increase
the frequency of testing if two consecutive bypass leak tests fail, and maintaining a TS requirement for the NRC to
review the schedule for subsequent tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During a LOCA inside containment, potential leak paths between the drywell and suppression chamber airspace could
result in excessive containment pressures, since the steam flow into the airspace would bypass the heat sink capabilities
of the suppression pool. The containment pressure response to the postulated bypass leakage can be mitigated by manually
actuating the suppression chamber sprays. Accordingly, since the sprays are manually actuated, an analysis was
performed to show that the operator has sufficient time to initiate the sprays prior to exceeding the containment
design pressure. This analysis is described in section 6.2.1.1.5 of the LGS Updated Final Safety Analysis Report
(UFSAR). The analysis is based on a small break LOCA inside containment with a differential pressure between the drywell-to-suppression
chamber equal to the static pressure due to downcomer submergence. The analysis concludes that the containment design
pressure of 55 psig will be reached in over 30 minutes from the onset of a small break LOCA assuming a drywell-to-suppression
chamber bypass flow area (i.e., A/square root of k) equal to 7.20 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 without operator intervention.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TS Limiting Condition for Operation 3.6.2.1.b conservatively specifies a maximum allowable bypass area of 10 % of
the design value of 7.20 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. This TS limit provides an additional safety factor of 10 above the conservatism taken in the steam bypass analysis
(i.e., 0.720 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). The drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test required by TS Surveillance Requirement 4.6.2.1.d verifies
that the actual bypass flow area is less than or equal to the TS limit of 0.720 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The bypass leakage test ensures that degradation in the measured bypass area is identified and corrected to ensure
containment integrity during LOCA events.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential bypass leakage paths can be divided into two categories as described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1) Leakage pathways other than those associated with the drywell-to-suppression chamber vacuum breaker assemblies
such as diaphragm floor penetrations (i.e., downcomer and Safety/Relief Valve (SRV) discharge line penetrations),
cracks in the diaphragm floor and/or liner plate, and cracks in the downcomers and SRV discharge lines that pass through
the suppression chamber airspace.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2) The four sets of drywell-to-suppression chamber vacuum breaker assemblies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other potential bypass leakage pathways have at least two isolation valves in the potential leakage path. These
valves are high quality leak-tight containment isolation valves that are normally closed and receive an isolation
signal to close. All Air Operated Valves (AOVs) in these paths fail closed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several plant design features and the bypass leak test data measured to date confirm that the leakage from other than
the vacuum breaker assemblies is negligible and indicates that this leakage will continue to be negligible for the
proposed increased duration between tests. All pressure boundary penetrations between the drywell and the suppression
chamber are welded except the vacuum breaker valves and the blind flanges closing 10 spare nozzles in the downcomers.
All pressure boundary penetrations between the drywell-to-suppression chamber have been fabricated, erected,
and inspected in accordance with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code, Section III, Subsection
NC, 1971 Edition, with the exception of the tees supporting the vacuum breakers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The downcomer and SRV discharge lines penetrate through the diaphragm slab and terminate in the suppression pool.
A steel ring plate is welded to the outside of the downcomers. The downcomer/ring plate assemblies are embedded in
the diaphragm slab with the top surface of the ring plate flush with the drywell side of the diaphragm slab. All connections
are welded to form a continuous steel membrane between the liner plate and downcomer penetrations. The SRV discharge
lines are routed through welded flued heads at the diaphragm floor. The flued head design and construction are similar
to the downcomer penetrations and also provide a continuous steel barrier. The downcomer and SRV discharge lines
are designed and constructed to safety-related requirements. In addition, they are designed for all postulated
loading conditions, including seismic, hydrodynamic, pressure, and temperature loads. The conservative design
requirements ensure that the SRV discharge and the downcomer lines will not contribute to bypass leakage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diaphragm floor is a reinforced concrete slab approximately 3.5 feet thick. The drywell side surface of the diaphragm
slab is capped with a 1/4 inch thick carbon steel liner plate. The liner plate and diaphragm slab provide a barrier against
the potential for bypass leakage through the diaphragm floor. The structural integrity of the diaphragm floor and
penetrations was demonstrated during the pre-operational test program. The drywell was pressurized to a drywell-to-suppression
chamber differential pressure of above 30 psid, which envelopes the maximum drywell-to-suppression chamber differential
pressure postulated to occur during LOCA conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There have been six Unit 1 and three Unit 2 bypass leak tests performed in accordance with TS Surveillance Requirement
4.6.2.1.d. These tests were conducted at a drywell-to-suppression chamber differential pressure of at least 4.0
psid. The measured leakage area includes leakage from both the vacuum breakers and sources other than vacuum breakers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In all cases, the measured leakage is significantly less than the TS and design values. The maximum measured leakage
areas are 0.0400 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 0.0111 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Unit 1 and Unit 2, respectively; or 5.56% and 1.55 %, respectively, of the TS limit. The average values are 0.0180
in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Unit 1 and 0.0107 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Unit 2; or 2.5% and 1.49%, respectively, of the TS limit of 0.720 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The minimum measured leakage areas are 0.0 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 0.0100 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for Unit 1 and Unit 2, respectively, or 0% and 1.3 %, respectively, of the TS limit. Clearly, the test data confirm that
the bypass leakage measured to date at LGS has been negligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, we have obtained bypass leakage data from the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, Susquehanna Steam
Electric Station (SSES), Units 1 and 2, which also has Mark II containments with the Anderson Greenwood vacuum breakers
(i.e., the same manufacturer as the vacuum breakers installed in the LGS, Unit 1 and Unit 2 containments) and therefore
the data is applicable to LGS. The maximum bypass leakage area for the SSES Unit 1 containment was 0.037 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, and 0.009 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 for the SSES Unit 2 containment, or 4.81% and 1.17%, respectively, of the SSES TS limit. Approval for a similar TS change
for SSES, Units 1 and 2 was issued by the NRC by letter dated August 11, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The remaining and most likely source of potential bypass leakage is the four sets of drywell-to-suppression chamber
vacuum breakers. Each set consists of two vacuum breakers in series, flange mounted to a tee off the downcomers in the
suppression chamber airspace. The drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test is currently required by TS
Surveillance requirement 4.6.2.1.d to be completed during each refueling outage and the results are used to verify
that the total bypass area, including that due to the vacuum breakers, meets the TS limit. If maintenance has been performed
on the vacuum breakers, this test also serves as a post-maintenance vacuum breakers leakage area test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes decrease the frequency of the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test. The drywell-to-suppression
chamber bypass leak test data obtained following vacuum breakers maintenance cannot be utilized to determine vacuum
breakers leakage reliability over the duration of the proposed test interval extension. To address this concern
and collect additional vacuum breakers leakage data, the proposed TS changes include an additional requirement
to perform a vacuum breaker leakage test as described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The leakage test will be conducted on each set of vacuum breakers (i.e., four vacuum breakers sets per unit) during
each refueling outage when the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test would not be required to be performed.
If maintenance is performed on the vacuum breaker assemblies, this additional test will be performed post-maintenance
to verify that the leakage is acceptable. This test will be conducted at a drywell-to-suppression chamber differential
pressure of 4.0 psid (i.e., the same as differential pressure required for the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass
leak test) by either pressurizing the drywell side of the vacuum breakers or inducing a vacuum on the suppression chamber
side of the vacuum breakers. The acceptance criteria for the vacuum breaker leakage tests will be as follows. The total
vacuum breaker leakage areas for all four sets of vacuum breakers will be less than or equal to 24% of the TS limit (i.e.,
0.24 x 0.720 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 = 0.173 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). This proposed acceptable vacuum breaker leakage area provides a 76% margin to the TS limit to account for the leakage
paths other than the vacuum breakers. As described above, previous bypass leakage testing measured a maximum bypass
leakage area of 5.56% of the TS limit. The 76% margin is sufficiently large to accommodate the other expected leakage
sources. In addition, each set of vacuum breakers will be limited to a leakage area twice the assumed leakage from a
single vacuum breaker set, assuming the leakage area is evenly distributed among the four sets of vacuum breakers
(i.e., four sets equate to 24% of the TS Limit where each set is 6% and twice this total is 12% of the TS Limit). This allows
a leakage of less than or equal to 0.0865 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i.e., (0.173 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 divided by 4 sets of vacuum breakers) x (a factor of 2 times the acceptable total) = 0.0865 in
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) for an individual set of vacuum breakers. This criterion is stipulated to identify individual sets of vacuum breakers
with higher leakage area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test data obtained during previous testing at LGS demonstrates
conformance by a large margin compared to the TS and design leakage requirements. The test data indicates that there
is negligible risk that the bypass leakage will change adversely in future years. Furthermore, the proposed test
frequency is judged to be acceptable based on the risk of the leakage sources other than the vacuum breakers being essentially
equivalent to that of the rest of the primary containment structure, which is leak tested (i.e., CILRT) every 40 +/^
10 months as required by TS Surveillance Requirement 4.6.1.2.a. A bypass leak test will be developed and conducted
to verify acceptable vacuum breaker bypass leakage areas for those outages when the bypass leak test will not be required
to be performed. The proposed vacuum breaker leakage test with stringent acceptance criteria, combined with other
negligible leakage areas, provide an acceptable level of assurance that the bypass leakage can be measured and an
adverse condition can be detected and corrected such that the existing level of confidence that the primary containment
will function as required during a LOCA is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes will not involve an increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS changes involve the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test frequency. There are no physical
or operational changes as a result of these proposed changes. These proposed changes include the requirement to perform
an additional surveillance test on the vacuum breaker assemblies, applying a differential pressure of 4.0 psid which
is the same differential pressure as currently required by TS for the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak
test. This required test will ensure that acceptable vacuum breaker leakage is maintained during those intervals
when the drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test is not required to be performed. Furthermore, the affected
structure (i.e., primary containment) acts as an accident mitigator and not as an accident initiator. Accordingly,
the possibility of a different type of malfunction of equipment or the possibility of an accident of a different type
is not introduced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed TS changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The drywell-to-suppression chamber bypass leak test data obtained during previous testing at LGS demonstrates
conformance by a large margin to the TS and design leakage requirements. The test data indicate that there is negligible
risk that the bypass leakage will change adversely in future years. Furthermore, the proposed test frequency is judged
to be acceptable based on the risk of sources of leakage other than the vacuum breakers being essentially equivalent
to that of the rest of the primary containment structure, which is tested every 40 +/^ 10 months. A bypass leak test will
be developed and conducted to verify acceptable vacuum breaker bypass leakage areas for those outages when the bypass
leak test will not be required to be performed. The proposed vacuum breaker leakage test with stringent acceptance
criteria, combined with the other negligible potential leakage areas, provide an acceptable level of assurance
that the bypass leakage can be measured and an adverse condition can be detected and corrected such that the existing
levels of confidence that the primary containment will function as required during a LOCA is maintained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the consequences of an accident are not impacted by this change and containment integrity during a LOCA
will be maintained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the proposed TS changes do not involve a reduction in a margin of safety.

The proposed Technical Specification (TS) changes to Surveillance Requirements would eliminate unnecessary emergency
diesel generator (EDG) testing when a diesel generator or an offsite power source becomes inoperable. The proposed
change would reduce the stresses on the diesel generators caused by unnecessary testing.

As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because implementation of the proposed TS change, which would delete the requirement to demonstrate the
operability of an otherwise operable EDG once the potential for a common cause failure has been dismissed, does not
affect the design or performance characteristics of an EDG. Similarly, deleting the requirement to demonstrate
the operability of EDGs when an offsite power source is inoperable does not affect the design or performance characteristics
of an EDG. Therefore, the EDGs will maintain their ability to perform their design function. The EDGs are not assumed
to be an initiator of any analyzed event. The role of the EDGs is the mitigation of accident consequences. Therefore,
this proposed TS change does not increase the probability of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The consequences of an accident previously evaluated could be affected by the proposed TS change. As described above,
implementation of the proposed change will result in the EDGs maintaining their ability to perform their design function.
Excessive testing of EDGs can cause reduced reliability. Precluding unnecessary testing of operable EDGs will improve
EDG reliability and thereby have an overall positive affect on plant safety. Therefore, this proposed TS change does
not increase the consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because implementation of the proposed TS change will not involve physical changes to plant systems, structures,
or components (SSC). The design or performance characteristics of the EDG will not be affected by the proposed change.
The proposed change does not introduce any new modes of plant operation or make any changes to system setpoints which
would initiate a new or different kind of accident. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident
from any accident previously evaluated is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the proposed TS change
does not affect the design or performance of any EDG. The change will increase EDG reliability by reducing the stresses
on the EDG from unnecessary testing. This will result in an overall increase in plant safety. Therefore, the proposed
change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed change does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated because the proposed TS change is administrative in nature. The PORC member titles will be removed from
the TS to facilitate not requiring that a TS change be submitted for NRC approval when position titles change. PORC
member qualifications will continue to be consistent with those required for the Facility Staff and meet or exceed
Sections 4.2, 4.4, or 4.6 of ANSI N18.1-1971. The proposed change ensures that PORC will continue to be comprised of
personnel involved in daily plant activities who are experienced individuals with varied expertise. By maintaining
the qualification requirements for members of PORC who represent various areas of expertise, PORC will continue
to fulfill its requirements specified in TS Section 6.5.1.6. The proposed change does not involve any physical changes
to plant systems, structures, or components (SSC), or the manner in which these SSC are operated, maintained, modified,
tested, or inspected. Therefore, the proposed TS change does not involve a significant increase in the probability
or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated because implementation of the proposed TS change will not involve physical changes to plant SSC or the manner
in which these SSC are operated, maintained, modified, tested or inspected. The proposed change does not introduce
any new modes of plant operation or make any changes to system setpoints which would initiate a new or different kind
of accident. Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated
is not created.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because the proposed TS change
is administrative in nature by providing internal flexibility in changing organizational titles and does not reduce
the PORC function or responsibilities. PORC will continue to be filled by appropriately qualified personnel who
have a variety of expertise. The change does not affect the plant material condition, operation, or accident analyses.
Therefore, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not involve any change to the configuration or
method of operation of any plant equipment used to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Also, the proposed changes
do not alter the conditions or assumptions in any of the FSAR accident analyses. Since the FSAR accident analyses remain
bounding, the radiological consequences previously evaluated are not adversely affected by the proposed changes.
Therefore, the proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated. The proposed changes are administrative in nature and do not involve any change to the configuration or
method of operation of any plant equipment used to mitigate the consequences of an accident.Accordingly, no new failure
modes have been defined for any plant system or component important to safety nor has any new limiting failure been
identified as a result of the proposed changes. Therefore, the proposed changes do not create the possibility of a
new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed changes are administrative
in nature and will continue to ensure that the response times for the RTS and ESFAS instrumentation do not exceed the
limits assumed in the accident analyses. As a result of the proposed changes, response time limits for the RTS and ESFAS
will be administratively controlled in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59, thus eliminating an unnecessary
burden of governmental regulation without reducing protection for public health and safety. Therefore, the proposed
changes do not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments provide an administrative vehicle for modifying a condition of the facility operating license
for each of the BFN units. The condition requires the licensee to implement and maintain in effect all provisions of
the ``Fire Protection Program (FPP)'' and lists the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff safety evaluations
(SE) approving the FPP. If the staff approves of a revision currently under review to an element of the FPP, the ``Appendix
R Safe Shutdown Program (SSP)'', the proposed amendments would add the staff SE documenting approval of the revised
SSP to the above listing of SEs in each facility operating license. The current SSP is directed toward the safe shutdown
of only one operating plant (Unit 2). The revised SSP would be directed toward the safe shutdown of two operating plants
(Units 2 and 3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the proposed amendments add the definition of the SSP to Section 1.0 of the Unit 3 Technical Specifications

The proposed changes are administrative in nature. Compliance with the applicable Appendix R requirements is ensured
through the implementation of the Fire Protection Program and Appendix R Safe Shutdown Program. The proposed change
does not affect any design basis accident and does not reduce or adversely affect the capability to achieve and maintain
safe shutdown in the event of a fire. Furthermore, no reductions to the requirements for equipment operability, surveillance
requirements or setpoints are being made which could result in reduction in the margin of safety. Therefore, these
proposed administrative changes will not result in a reduction in the margin of safety.

Description of amendment request:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would delete reference in the BFN Unit 3 Technical Specifications (TS) to the Reactor Water
Cleanup (RWCU) system floor drain high temperature switches and the RWCU system space high temperature switches.
The piping configuration for the Unit 3 RWCU system has been modified, and the licensee contends that its revised High
Energy Line Break (HELB) analysis has demonstrated that these switches are no longer required. Instead, to initiate
RWCU system isolation, the HELB analysis has indicated the need for temperature switches in the main steam vault,
the heat exchanger room, and the RWCU pipe trench. The proposed amendment therefore would add temperature switches
to the Unit 3 TS for these areas and modify the TS Bases section accordingly. The proposed amendment also adds clarifying
remarks to Tables 3.2.A and 3.2.B of the TS for each of the BFN units. The proposed remarks list the actuation signals
for the various primary containment valve group isolations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An analysis of HELBs in the Unit 3 reactor building identified certain RWCU pipe breaks which could not be automatically
detected and isolated in a reasonable time frame. To resolve this issue, a design change is being performed to remove
from service the existing non-environmentally qualified temperature switches used to detect RWCU line breaks and
replace them with environmentally qualified RTDs [resistance temperature detectors] and IEEE [Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers] Class 1E qualified ATUs [analog trip units] located to detect and isolate the critical
RWCU pipe breaks. This TS amendment adds the new ATUs [sic] function to Tables 3.2.A and 4.2.A. Note 14 is deleted from
Table 3.2.A since it only applies to the temperature switches being removed from the table. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safety function of the RTD/ATU temperature loops is to provide an isolation signal to close the RWCU suction line
isolation valves (FCV-69-001 and FCV-69-002) and RWCU return line valve (FCV-69-012) on a high area temperature.
This ensures RWCU pipe breaks are isolated. No other RWCU safety functions are affected by the change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new RTD/ATU temperature loops were chosen to decrease the time required to initiate closure of the RWCU valves.
This improves the detection/isolation of RWCU breaks and helps to limit the reactor coolant lost, helps ensure core
cooling, and helps ensure that environmental conditions inside the reactor building are maintained within the required
limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Components added by this change are qualified for the environment in which they will operate. This ensures that the
system will perform its function in a post accident environment. No additional paths for the release of radiation
or contamination are created. The failure modes of the RTDs and ATUs are such that any single failure will result in
a gross failure alarm and/or a channel trip. Because of the redundancy, separations, and logic designed into the system,
a single failure of any part of the system will not prevent isolation of the primary containment isolation valves and
spurious operation is minimized. The RTDs will be located and the instrument setpoints will be set to preclude spurious
trips due to ambient temperatures including localized hot areas while assuring a timely trip due to a pipe break. Therefore,
the proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This change is being made to improve the RWCU leak detection/isolation function of the RWCU Primary Containment Isolation
System (PCIS). The PCIS will perform its intended safety function in the same manner as the previous installation.
There is no affect [sic] on the function or operation of any other plant system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure of the RTD/ATU temperature loops would be no different than failure of existing temperature switches. Since
environmental qualification requirements, divisional separation, single failure requirements and one-out-of-two
taken twice logic requirements are maintained, the possibility of a RWCU isolation failure on a RWCU line break or
of a spurious isolation is no more likely after the change than before.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the existing design, logic relays are powered from RPS Bus A or B. The new design also uses RPS Bus A or B to feed the ATUs.
Therefore, the consequence of a power failure is unchanged from the present design. The seismic qualification and
proper circuit coordination of the installation is maintained. The system functions and operates in the same manner
as previously evaluated in the Safety Analysis Report. No new system interactions other than additional RTDs located
in the main steam valve vault to input into the PCIS logic for isolation of the RWCU have been introduced by this activity.
Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety will be enhanced by installing instruments that provide quicker response to a temperature rise
indicative of a pipe break. Calculations have been performed to determine the analytical limits for the RTD/ATU temperature
loops in each of the monitored areas and to determine the setpoints for the ATUs in each area. The setpoints are set above
the maximum expected room temperatures to avoid spurious actuations due to ambient conditions and below the analytical
limits to ensure timely detection of a pipe break. This type of design utilizing ATUs has been analyzed by the NRC [U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff] (NEDO-21617, Analog Transmitter/Trip Unit System for Engineered Safeguard
Sensor Trip Input) and has been found to be generically acceptable at BWR facilities. Therefore, the proposed amendment
does not involve a significant reduction in any margin of safety.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Description of amendment request: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed change would change the Technical Specifications (TS) for the North Anna Power Station, Units No. 1 and
No. 2 (NA-1&amp;2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the proposed changes would modify the surveillance frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps
from monthly to quarterly in accordance with the guidance provided in Generic Letter 93-05, ``Line-Item Technical
Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation,'' dated
September 27, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC has completed a comprehensive examination of surveillance requirements in TS that require testing at power.
The evaluation is documented in NUREG-1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specification Surveillance Requirements,''
dated December 1992. The NRC staff found, that while the majority of testing at power is important, safety can be improved,
equipment degradation decreased, and an unnecessary burden on personnel resources eliminated by reducing the amount
of testing at power that is required by TS. Based on the results of the evaluations documented in NUREG 1366, the NRC
issued Generic Letter 93-05. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Auxiliary Feedwater System supplies water to the steam generators to remove decay heat from the Reactor Coolant
System. To ensure operability of the Auxiliary Feedwater System, the pumps are currently tested on a monthly basis
as required by the TS. Consistent with Generic Letter 93-05, Item 9.1 and NUREG-1366, the licensee is requesting a
change to the surveillance testing frequency for the Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps from monthly to quarterly on a staggered
test basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration,
which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, operation of North Anna Power Station in accordance with the proposed Technical Specifications changes
will not:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the surveillance test frequencies of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not significantly affect
the probability of occurrence or consequences of any previously evaluated accidents. Quarterly testing of the pumps
on a staggered basis will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be capable of performing its
intended functions. Therefore, the change in frequency of testing the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not
affect the probability or consequences of any previously analyzed accident.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Changing the surveillance test frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not involve any physical modification
of the plant or result in a change in a method of operation. Quarterly testing of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps
on a staggered basis will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be capable of performing its
intended function. Therefore, a new or different type of accident is not made possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changing the surveillance test frequency of the Auxiliary Feedwater System pumps does not affect any safety limits
or limiting safety system settings. System operating parameters are unaffected. The availability of equipment
required to mitigate or assess the consequence of an accident is not reduced. Quarterly testing of the Auxiliary Feedwater
System pumps on a staggered basis will continue to assure that the Auxiliary Feedwater System will be capable of performing
its intended functions. Safety margins are, therefore, not decreased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards consideration.

Brief description of amendments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments revise the Technical Specification to (a) reduce the slope of the axial power imbalance penalty in
the overtemperature-delta temperature reactor protection system trip setpoint equation, and (b) increase the
boron concentration limits in the cold leg accumulators, the refueling water storage tank, the reactor coolant system,
and refueling canal during MODE 6 conditions. These changes reflect the reloading of Unit 1 with Mark BW fuel for Cycle
8 including an increase in cycle length from 350 effective full power days (EFPD) to 390 EFPD.

Brief description of amendments: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments revise the Technical Specifications (TS) Figure 2.1-1, certain TS Table 2.2-1 factors in the equation
for the OVERTEMPERATURE delta T and OVERPOWER delta T setpoints, and Figure 3.2-1 to reflect a reduction in the required
minimum measured reactor coolant system (RCS) flow rate from 385,000 gallons per minute (gpm) to 382,000 gpm for Unit
1. Catawba Unit 2 values are unchanged and, accordingly, certain TS pages were modified to retain the current TS values
in effect for Unit 2. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The need for these changes is attributed to the effects of steam generator tube plugging and to a hot leg temperature
streaming phenomenon. The application also proposed to revise the text of TS 2.1.1 and the definition for TS Figure
2.1-1. These changes are not related to the changes in RCS flow rate. The staff is continuing to review these proposed
changes and, accordingly, they are not dealt with in this amendment.

These amendments increase the shutdown margin requirements for the current operating cycle at both units; reduce
the containment pressure high-high setpoint and allowable value; and change the containment spray system, containment
fan cooler and service water system response times. These changes were necessitated by the discovery of containment
fan cooler unit and containment spray system response times greater than originally assumed for Loss of Coolant Accident
(LOCA) or Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) analysis, and auxiliary feedwater system flow greater than assumed for the
MSLB analysis.

Notice of Issuance of Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses and Final Determination of No Significant Hazards
Consideration and Opportunity For a Hearing (Exigent Public Announcement or Emergency Circumstances)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the period since publication of the last biweekly notice, the Commission has issued the following amendments.
The Commission has determined for each of these amendments that the application for the amendment complies with the
standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations.
The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in
10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the date the amendment was needed, there was not time
for the Commission to publish, for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendment, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For exigent circumstances, the Commission has either issued a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
notice providing opportunity for public comment or has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area
surrounding a licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission's proposed determination
of no significant hazards consideration. The Commission has provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to
comment, using its best efforts to make available to the public means of communication for the public to respond quickly,
and in the case of telephone comments, the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licensee
has been informed of the public comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted, for example, in derating or shutdown of a
nuclear power plant or in prevention of either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up to the plant's
licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunity to provide for public comment on its no significant
hazards consideration determination. In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunity for
comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than 30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity
for public comment. If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, the State has been consulted
by telephone whenever possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediately effective, notwithstanding the
pendency before it of a request for a hearing from any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any required
hearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards consideration is involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made a final determination that the amendment involves
no significant hazards consideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documents related to
this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued and made effective as indicated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendments satisfy the criteria for categorical
exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR 51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impact statement
or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments. If the Commission has prepared an environmental
assessment under the special circumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determination based on that
assessment, it is so indicated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility
Operating License, and (3) the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or Environmental Assessment,
as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the
Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the local public document room for the particular
facility involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the issuance of the amendment. By February
4, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility
operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as
a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing or petition
for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated
by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or
petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of a hearing or
an appropriate order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendment
involves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested, it will not stay the effectiveness of the
amendment. Any hearing held would take place while the amendment is in effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1-(800) 248-5100 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023 and the following message addressed
to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for a hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the Atomic
Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors
specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment changes the existing technical specifications (TS) by adding a footnote to TS 4.4.5.0 to address steam
generator (SG) operability requirements. The change references an unscheduled inspection of the 1C SG which occurred
due to a tube leak in that SG. The amendment was required because the circumstances of the inspection were not covered
by the existing TS 3/4.4.5. It will allow SG operability requirements to be satisfied until the next SG inservice inspection,
scheduled to begin no later than March 5, 1993.

On October 27, 1993, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange

The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33241 (November 23, 1993),

<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The CXM is a standardized basket product consisting of twenty-five shares of each of the stocks included in the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange's (``Merc'') ``MMI'' futures contract. That contract is based on the American Stock Exchange's
(``Amex'') Major Market Index (``MMI''), a broad-based price-weighted index of twenty stocks listed on the New York
Stock Exchange (``NYSE'').

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange proposes to extend the hours for trading the CXM until 3:15 Central time (4:15 Eastern time). This proposal
will make the trading hours of the CXM consistent with the trading hours of derivative products that are based on the
same index as the CXM and other derivative products that could be used as a hedge against the CXM. According to the Exchange,
similar trading hours should provide risk management benefits when trading the CXM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange states that the proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act in that it is designed
to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and
open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of section 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

In recent years, concerns have been raised about the role that index-related trading strategies (e.g., use of the
equity cash market to hedge positions in stock index futures and options contracts) played in increasing market volatility.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 As a result, the Commission has, among other things, encouraged the national securities exchanges to list and trade
standardized baskets of stocks.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that, in comparison to other methods of portfolio trading, basket products, such as the CXM,
are an efficient means to make investment decisions based on the direction of standardized measures of stock market
performance, and may enhance the market's ability to absorb program trading.

In addition to the CXM, the Commission has approved the trading of market baskets on the NYSE and the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (``CBOE''). See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 27382 (October 26, 1989), 54 FR 45834 (October 31,

The Commission has concluded that extending the trading hours for the CXM will enhance market participants' ability
to use that basket for hedging purposes. The CXM offers a highly correlative hedge to the Merc's ``MMI'' futures contract.
In addition, the CXM could be used to offset a position in the options on the MMI futures contract that are traded on the
Merc; in the options on the MMI that are traded on the Amex; or in derivative products on other broad-based stock market
indexes.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 At the moment, however, CXM trading ends at 3 Central time (4 Eastern time), while trading of such derivative products
continues until 3:15 Central time (4:15 Eastern time). The Commission recognizes that the current lack of coordination
may hinder market participants' ability to adjust their risk in response to late price movements in the derivatives
market.

Accordingly, the Commission believes that synchronizing the close of trading for the CXM with the close of trading
for such derivative products will allow market participants to hedge their positions more effectively. Specifically,
traders and investors will be able to employ closing strategies that reflect price movements that take place during
the last fifteen minutes of derivatives trading, as well as complete last sale information for the various indexes'
component stocks. To the extent that the CHX proposal will promote fair hedging opportunities, the Commission finds
that extended trading hours should increase volume in the CXM, thereby adding to the depth and liquidity of the market
for that basket product.

The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of the notice of filing thereof. The CHX proposal is designed to eliminate a barrier to fair hedging opportunities;
accelerated approval thereof will allow the resulting risk management benefits for traders and investors to be realized
immediately. In addition, the proposed rule change was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSTC proposes to amend Article Ten of its Articles of Incorporation and Article VI, Section 1 of its By-Laws to limit
or eliminate the potential monetary liability of its directors to the extent permitted by the Illinois Business Corporation
Act except where such liability is the result of a violation of the federal securities laws.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and statutory basis for the
proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposal. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal will limit or eliminate the potential monetary liability of MSTC directors under certain circumstances.
The proposed change is based on Section 2.10(b)(3) of the Illinois Business Corporation Act, under which MSTC is organized,
which allows corporations to adopt provisions in their articles of incorporation that limit or eliminate the potential
monetary liability of directors under certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
General corporate law imposes a fiduciary duty of care upon each corporate director. This duty of care requires a director
to exercise informed business judgment in good faith and to act with an honest believe that the action taken is in the
best interest of the corporation. The proposal will not eliminate an MSTC's director's duty of care but will limit
the personal liability of an MSTC director to MSTC or its shareholders should the director fail through negligence
or gross negligence to satisfy his or her duty of care.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Under Illinois law, such limitations of personal liability do not apply in certain situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
MSTC's proposal will limit a director's liability even if that director had been grossly negligent provided that
the director exercised informed business judgment in good faith and acted with an honest belief that the action taken
was in the best interest of the corporation. Because there has been no judicial interpretation on the scope of the applicable
Illinois legislation, it is possible that an Illinois court may find as a matter of law that a director cannot act in
a manner that is both grossly negligent and in good faith.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal will prohibit limitation of a director's liability in instances where liability arises directly or
indirectly as a result of a violation of federal securities laws. The proposal will not eliminate equitable remedies
such as rescission or injunctive actions. Moreover, it will not eliminate the liability of an officer of MSTC for actions
taken in that capacity even if the officer is also a director. Finally, the proposal will not affect the liability of
a director for acts or omissions that occurred prior to approval of the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Limiting or eliminating directors' liability will help to ensure that MSTC will be able to recruit and retain competent
directors. Due to the increased number and magnitude of lawsuits against directors, many other corporations from
various states already have adopted provisions similar to those in MSTC's proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act because it will remove an impediment
to attracting competent directors and thus will help assure the fair representation of shareholders and participants
in the selection of directors and in the administration of MSTC's affairs.

Description and Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1984, the Commission adopted amendments to paragraph (c) of Securities Exchange Act Rule 19d&hyph;1 to allow SROs
to submit, for Commission approval, plans for the abbreviated reporting of minor rule violations.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Subsequently, in 1985, the Commission approved an NYSE Plan for the abbreviated reporting of minor rule violations
pursuant to Rule 19d&hyph;1(c) under the Act. The Plan relieves the NYSE of the current reporting requirements imposed
under section 19(d)(1) of the Act for violations listed in NYSE Rule 476A. The NYSE Plan, as embodied in NYSE Rule 476A,
provides that the Exchange may designate violations of certain rules as minor rule violations. The Exchange may impose
a fine, not to exceed $5,000, on any member, member organization, allied member, approved person, or registered or
non-registered employee of a member or member organization for a violation of the delineated rules by issuing a citation
with a specific penalty.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Such person can either accept the penalty, or opt for a full disciplinary hearing on the matter. Fines assessed pursuant
to NYSE Rule 476A in excess of $2,500 are not considered pursuant to the Plan and must be reported in a manner consistent
with the current reporting requirement of section 19(d)(1) of the Act. The Exchange also retains the option of bringing
violations of rules included under NYSE Rule 476A to full disciplinary proceedings, and the Commission expects the
Exchange to do so for egregious or repeat violations.

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21013 (June 1, 1984), 49 FR 23828 (June 8, 1984). Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1)
of Rule 19d&hyph;1, an SRO is required to file promptly with the Commission notice of any ``final'' disciplinary action
taken by the SRO. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 19d&hyph;1, any disciplinary action taken by an SRO for a violation
of an SRO rule that has been designated a minor rule violation pursuant to the Plan shall not be considered ``final''
for purposes of section 19(d)(1) of the Act if the sanction imposed consists of a fine not exceeding $2,500 and the sanctioned
person has not sought an adjudication, including a hearing, or otherwise exhausted his or her administrative remedies.
By deeming unadjudicated minor violations as not final, the Commission permits the SRO to report violations on a periodic,
as opposed to immediate, basis.

, only those fines imposed that are not in excess of $2,500 are subject to periodic reporting. Fines imposed pursuant

In adopting Rule 19d&hyph;1, the Commission noted that the Rule was an attempt to balance the informational needs
of the Commission against the reporting burdens of the SROs.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In promulgating paragraph (c) of the Rule, the Commission was attempting further to reduce those reporting burdens
by permitting, where immediate reporting was unnecessary, quarterly reporting of minor rule violations. The Rule
is intended to be limited to rules which can be adjudicated quickly and objectively.

The NYSE currently is adding its procedures with respect to entry and cancellation of MOC orders on expiration days
to the list of minor rule violations subject to the Rule 476A minor rule violation plan. The MOC order entry and cancellation
procedures require, for example, that MOC orders be entered on the Exchange by 3:40 p.m. on expiration days if they
are related to a strategy including any stock index future, stock index option or option on stock index future in expiring
contracts, and that no cancellations of such orders be effected after 3:40 p.m. Violations of these policies could
include late entry of MOC orders, entry of MOC orders which do not offset a published imbalance of 50,000 shares or more
in a pilot stock or an improper cancellation of an MOC order. These procedures are announced to members and member organizations
through an Information Memo issued approximately one week before each expiration day.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of sections 6(b)(1), (6) and (7), 6(d)(1) and 19(d) of the Act.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(6) requirement that the rules of an exchange provide that its members
and persons associated with its members shall be appropriately disciplined for violations of rules of the exchange.
In this regard, the proposal provides an efficient procedure for appropriate disciplining of members for a rule violation
that is technical and objective in nature. Moreover, because the Plan provides procedural rights to the person fined
and permits a disciplined person to request a full hearing on the matter, the proposal provides a fair procedure for
the disciplining of members and persons associated with members, consistent with sections 6(b)(7) and 6(d)(1) of
the Act.

15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(1), (6) and (7), 78f(d)(1) and 78s(d) (1988).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also believes that the proposal provides an alternate means by which to deter violations of the NYSE
rules included in the Plan, thus furthering the purposes of section 6(b)(1) of the Act. An exchange's ability to effectively
enforce compliance by its members and member organizations with Commission and Exchange rules is central to its self-regulatory
functions. Inclusion of a rule in an exchange's minor rule violation plan should not be interpreted to mean it is an
unimportant rule. On the contrary, the Commission recognizes that inclusion of rules under a minor rule violation
plan may not only reduce reporting burdens on an SRO but also may make its disciplinary system more efficient in prosecuting
violations of these rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, because the NYSE retains the discretion to bring a full disciplinary proceeding for any violation included
on the List, the Commission believes that adding the procedures for entry and cancellation of MOC orders on expiration
days to the List will enhance, rather than reduce, the NYSE's enforcement capabilities of these Exchange procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described above, MOC procedures are subject to change on a monthly basis and are outlined in an Information Memo
disseminated to the members and member organizations prior to each expiration day. The Commission believes that
whether a member or member organization has followed such specifically outlined procedures is amenable to quick,
objective determinations of compliance with respect to activity on each expiration day. The quick and efficient
resolution of questions of compliance with such procedures would facilitate the Exchange's ability to induce continued
compliance without being hindered by the additional time and cost associated with more sophisticated Exchange disciplinary
actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Commission believes that the inclusion of the MOC procedural rules will prove to be an effective alternate
response to a violation when the initiation of a full disciplinary proceeding is unsuitable because such a proceeding
may be more costly and time-consuming in view of the minor nature of the particular violation. This is further reinforced
by the nature of the monthly dissemination of these procedures to the members and their potential for change each month
in response to the instruments affected on the expiration day and the surrounding circumstances at that time. By including
the MOC procedures in the Rule 476A Minor Rule Violation List, the NYSE can quickly respond to violations, thereby
deterring similar infractions the following month.

December 29, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 16, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed modification to NYSE policy would amend Paragraph 103 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual (``Non-U.S.
Companies'') to permit non-U.S. issuers to distribute summary annual reports to U.S. holders, under certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed modification to policy recognizes an amendment, adopted in 1990, to the U.K. Companies Act which permits
issuers listed on the London Stock Exchange to provide an option to holders of their ordinary shares to receive a full
annual report or a summary annual report. The Companies Act sets forth the specific financial and management information
that must be contained in the summary reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Companies Act, as amended, also requires that shareholders who receive only the summary report be given the opportunity,
at any time, to obtain the full annual report from the company and that companies must notify shareholders annually
of this right and how the report might be obtained. When the program was instituted in the U.K. in 1990, shareholders
received both reports and notice of the available option with respect to future reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certain U.K. issuers are now seeking permission from the NYSE to provide holders of listed ADRs with summary reports
in place of full annual reports if the holders do not object. The proposed modification to policy is necessary to grant
permission since current policy requires all listed companies to submit to shareholders an annual report with financial
information as detailed in Paragraph 203.01 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The creation of the summary annual reports in the U.K. was prompted by two objectives: Potential cost savings to the
company and the ability to provide a more easily read document to retail holders. The effort has been deemed successful
in the U.K. since a majority of shareholders now receive the summary reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange is proposing that the NYSE annual report requirements be modified to allow holders of NYSE-listed non-U.S.
securities to receive summary annual reports if (i) this is the practice in the home country and (ii) certain conditions
are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, issuers proposing to provide summary annual reports to ADR holders would be required to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) provide ADR holders with an ongoing option to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Receive the full annual report on demand, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Annually change their election (as in the U.K., U.S. ADR holders would initially receive both reports and notice
of the available option with respect to future reports); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Follow the specific dictates of home country law or business practice with respect to the data presented; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Include a U.S. GAAP reconciliation to the extent that such reconciliation would be required in the full annual
report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposal would be consistent with the Exchange's policies for non-U.S. companies which effectively allow these
companies to follow home country practice in such areas as interim reporting and corporate governance. In addition,
we believe the modification to policy would be consistent with the SEC's posture toward non-U.S. companies of being
accommodating without compromising disclosure.

2. Statutory Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The basis under the Act for this proposed rule change is the requirement under section 6(b)(5) that an exchange have
rules that are designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable
principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling,
processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to
and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors
and the public interest.

B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change does not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants
or Others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange has not solicited, and does not intend to solicit, comments on this proposed rule change. The Exchange
has not received any unsolicited written comments from members or other interested parties. However, the Exchange
adopted this proposed rule change, in part, in response to a petition from eight listed U.K. companies requesting
that the exchange allow them to use summary annual reports.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 103 of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the
Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which
depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations,
and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation
with interested and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements
of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility
program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing
noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional non-compatible uses.

Map and the 1996 future Noise Exposure Map. The FAA has determined that these maps for the Minneapolis-St. Paul International
(Wold-Chamberlain Field) Airport are in compliance with the applicable requirements. This determination is effective
on December 10, 1993. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a finding that
the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR part 150. Such determination
does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility
program or to fund the implementation of that program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted
on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way
in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting
the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions
of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities
of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review
of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detail overlaying of noise exposure contours onto
the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator who submitted those maps,
or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act.
The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under &sect;150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutorily
required consultation has been accomplished.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for the Minneapolis-St. Paul International (Wold-Chamberlain
Field) Airport, also effective on December 10, 1993. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that
it conforms to the requirements for the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be
necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of
180 days, will be completed on or before June 8, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150, &sect;150.33. The primary
considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety,
create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing
existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments,
other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable.
Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program
are available for examination at the following locations:

The Northwest Mountain Region of the Federal Aviation Administration (``FAA'') and the Port of Seattle (``Port'')
announce that the FAA and the Port, acting as joint lead agencies, intend to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) for a proposal by the Port to develop a new parallel runway and other airport facility improvements to be examined
in an update to the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac Airport) Master Plan. To ensure that all significant
issues related to the proposed action are identified, scoping comments are requested.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Recent planning studies have indicated both an existing and long-term need for additional airfield capacity at Sea-Tac
Airport. Under current demand levels, the Airport experiences reduced operating capability and delay during bad
weather conditions due to the close-spacing of the existing parallel runways. During busy hours, arrival demand
exceeds the bad weather arrival capacity and aircraft and passenger delays result. In addition to increasing the
severity of delays caused by bad weather, continued growth in aircraft operational demand is projected to exceed
Sea-Tac's annual airfield capacity within the next ten years. The objective of the Master Plan Update, and accompanying
EIS, is to address the bad weather capacity problem and to meet long-term regional air travel needs spurred by a growing
regional economy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared for the Master Plan Update, which is expected to include
numerous projects including, but not be limited to: A new parallel runway and improvements to the passenger terminal,
ground access system, and other support facilities. The range of new parallel runway options that may be considered
in the EIS are anticipated to be in the immediate vicinity of the existing airfield at Sea-Tac Airport. Based on the
Master Plan Update, other airport developments that may be considered in the EIS would be located on or in the immediate
vicinity of the existing Sea-Tac Airport property. Mitigation measures will be proposed, as necessary, for the significant
adverse impacts created by development. Major actions or concepts to be discussed in the draft EIS include the no action
alternative and other reasonable alternatives meeting the purpose and need. Such alternatives are expected to include
several options related to runway lengths, separations and threshold stagger.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA and Port of Seattle have determined that the new parallel runway is likely to have a significant adverse impact
on the environment. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required under the National Environmental Policy
Act and the Washington State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), RCW 43.21C.030(2)(c) and will be prepared. The FAA
and Port of Seattle have identified the following key areas for discussion in the EIS including, but not limited to:
Alternatives, noise and land use, social and socio-economic impacts, human health, water resources, biotic communities,
construction, earth, transportation and air quality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Scoping is the initial step in the preparation of the EIS. The scoping process is ``an early and open process for determining
the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues related to the proposed action.'' Agencies,
affected tribes, and members of the public are invited to comment on the scope of the EIS. You may comment on alternatives,
mitigation measures, probable significant adverse impacts, and licenses or other approvals that may be required.
Comments and suggestions are invited from Federal, State and local agencies, and other interested parties and individuals
to ensure that the full range of issues related to a Master Plan Update EIS are addressed and all significant issues
identified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To facilitate the receipt of comments, two scoping meetings will be conducted. A public workshop will be conducted
to receive written comments on February 9, 1994 from 4 p.m. until 8 p.m. at Tyee Senior High School, 4424 South 188th
Street, City of SeaTac. The second meeting will be held on February 10, 1994 between 9:30 a.m. and 11 a.m. for Federal,
state and local agencies in the Sea-Tac Auditorium, Mezzanine Level Main Terminal Building, Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport.
