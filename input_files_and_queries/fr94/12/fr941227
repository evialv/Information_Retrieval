The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is amending its regulations to reflect that agency heads must ensure that
employees and applicants for employment at their agencies are notified of the provisions in the Hatch Act Reform Amendments
of 1993, which prohibit individuals from requesting, making, transmitting, accepting, or considering political
recommendations in effecting personnel actions.

Section 8 of the Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993, Pub. L. 103&hyph;94, amended section 3303 of title 5, United States
Code, to expand and strengthen the prohibition against political recommendations in examinations and appointments.
Although section 3303 was limited to prohibiting political recommendations in connection with examinations for,
or appointments to, positions in the competitive service, the amended section 3303 includes other personnel actions
as well. It defines ``personnel action'' as any action described in 5 U.S.C. 2302(a)(2)(A)(i)&hyph;(ix), including
appointments, promotions, disciplinary or corrective actions, details, transfers, reassignments, reinstatements,
restorations, reemployments, performance evaluations, and decisions concerning pay, benefits, or awards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amended section 3303 provides for OPM to issue regulations requiring agency heads to ensure that employees and
applicants are notified of its provisions. On February 22, 1994, OPM issued its proposal to amend 5 CFR part 300 by adding
a new subpart H which would require agency heads to ensure that applicants and employees are notified of the provisions
of 5 U.S.C. 3303, as amended. OPM's proposal also listed strategies for issuing notifications, but noted that the
list is not exclusive and gives agency officials the discretion to consider and implement other means of notification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OPM received comments from three Federal agencies and one Federal employee organization about the proposed regulations.
One Federal agency commented that placing additional administrative requirements on Federal agencies appears
to be inconsistent with the intent of the National Performance Review recommendations to streamline the Federal
government and reduce funding, spending, and reporting requirements. The agency suggested that OPM explore other
alternatives for complying with the Reform Amendments, such as issuing instructions to agencies to disregard political
recommendations received incident to personnel actions and to notify the alleged offenders accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended 5 U.S.C. 3303 provides that ``[u]nder regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management,
the head of each agency shall ensure that employees and applicants are given notice of the provisions of this section.''
Section 3303, as amended, clearly contemplates that OPM shall issue the specified regulations; it does not give OPM
any discretion to select an alternate method of requiring agency heads to notify employees and applicants of the prohibition
against soliciting, making, receiving, or accepting political recommendations. Therefore, OPM cannot adopt the
suggestion to explore other alternatives for complying with the regulatory mandate in 5 U.S.C. 3303, as amended.
Moreover, OPM's regulations are consistent with the spirit and intent of the National Performance Review recommendations.
In recognition of these recommendations, OPM has left to each agency head the discretion to select the methods of notification
which most suit the needs of his or her own agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (h) of the amended section 3303 specifically provides that the prohibition recommendations does not
affect the right of an employee under 5 U.S.C. 7211 to petition Congress. A second Federal agency suggested that OPM
provide examples in its regulations to show what would be included or excluded under the statutory right to petition
Congress. OPM has already provided agencies with written guidance on the amended section 3303, and will provide further
guidance should the need arise. Therefore, OPM believes it is not necessary to include such examples in its regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third Federal agency suggested that OPM note in its regulations that subsection (f)(2) of the amended section
3303 permits recommendations which are based solely on the character of an employee or applicant. OPM does not believe
that it is necessary to include this provision in its regulations because the provision already is stated in the controlling
statute. The agency further suggested that, in section 300.801 of the regulation, OPM replace the word ``effecting''
with ``affecting.'' OPM intended that &sect;300.801 would relate to ``effecting'' or bringing about personnel
actions, rather than to ``affecting'' or influencing such actions. Therefore, OPM does not intend to revise the proposed
&sect;300.801 in the manner suggested.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, one Federal employee organization commented that OPM's regulatory proposal is fully supported by the applicable
provisions of law.

Section 3303, as amended, specifically authorizes OPM to promulgate regulations requiring agency heads to ensure
that employees and applicants receive notice of its provisions. Therefore, OPM is amending Part 300 by adding a new
Subpart H&hyph;Notification Requirements Relating to the Statutory Prohibitions on Political Recommendations
in Personnel Actions. Section 300.801 of the new Subpart H states that agency heads must ensure that applicants and
employees are notified of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 3303, as amended. Section 300.802 lists strategies for issuing
notifications, but also specifies that the list is not exclusive and gives agency officials the discretion to consider
and implement other means of notification.

 The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to improve the administrative process used
by the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance (FEGLI) and Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Programs in
resolving disputes between Federal employees and agencies over coverage and enrollment issues. The purpose of these
regulations is to improve the performance of the Government by delegating to Federal agencies the authority to reconsider
disputes over coverage and enrollment issues in these two programs and to make retroactive as well as prospective
corrections of errors.

OPM received comments from nine agency headquarters or installations, one employee organization, and one health
insurance carrier. Three commenters expressed their approval of the proposed regulations without further comment.
The other eight commenters expressed various concerns about the changes made by the proposed regulations and about
the procedures they would have to develop in order to comply with them. Generally, the comments reflected considerable
confusion on the part of agencies as to exactly what they would be required to do under these proposed regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters expressed the belief that the statistics provided in the supplementary information do not support
the delegation of the reconsideration decision to agencies because they represent errors on the part of agencies.
These statistics showed that about one-third of the cases OPM received involved decisions about retroactive changes,
which agencies cannot make under current regulations. Therefore, these do not represent errors on the part of agencies.
An additional 23 percent of the requests OPM received were returned to the agencies because the employees had not followed
administrative procedures_in most cases employees had not asked their agencies for an initial decision. These,
also, do not represent agency errors. Because some cases involved both an enrollment issue and a retroactive coverage
issue, the percentages do not show the exact number of cases where agency error may have been involved. However, in
more than half the cases, agency error was not involved. Considering the tremendous volume of enrollment decisions
that employing offices make each year, the fact that so few decisions are disputed by employees reflects a remarkable
achievement by employing offices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters were uncertain about what ``administrative error'' means. Generally, an administrative error
occurs when an employing office misapplies the law or regulations, misinforms employees, or fails to inform employees
when required to do so. It could include any mistake on the part of the employing office that directly results in the
loss of a benefit or opportunity to an employee. We have not incorporated a definition into the regulations because
doing so would tend to narrow the application of the term. One of the commenters asked that we clarify the difference
between ``administrative error'' in &sect;&sect;870.102(a) and 890.103(a) and ``error'' in &sect;&sect;870.102(b)
and 890.103(b). There is no difference; therefore, we are changing the regulations to read ``administrative error''
in each case.
<!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters questioned OPM's ``equity and good conscience'' authority and asked if they must give an appeal
right to OPM when they issue a reconsideration decision. OPM's ``equity and good conscience authority,'' which allows
us to order the correction of an administrative error, is not a part of the administrative review process. The administrative
review process ends with the agency's reconsideration decision. However, without the authority to order a correction,
OPM could not overrule an agency reconsideration decision that is obviously in disregard of law and regulations and
is unfair to the employee. While these situations are rare, OPM must retain the authority to correct them. OPM will
issue guidance to agencies to help them in developing procedures for making reconsideration decisions.

One commenter believes that, although delegation will reduce costs to OPM, it will increase them for the agencies.
Based on the relatively small number of reconsideration decisions that OPM issues each year for the entire Government,
it is unlikely that any agency will have a large enough volume of reconsideration requests to affect costs. However,
if an agency should find that it is getting an unusually large number of reconsideration requests, it may find that
the procedures or training it is giving to personnel staff in its installations need to be reviewed and strengthened.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that OPM issue procedures regarding the review of agency actions when heirs contest the life
insurance coverage of a deceased employee. This kind of dispute is a claims issue rather than an enrollment issue.
Life insurance claims are handled by the Office of Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance (OFEGLI). If it appears
that enrollment issues are involved OFEGLI normally contacts OPM for help in resolving the matter. Since this kind
of dispute must be resolved on a case-by-case basis, detailed procedures for agencies are inappropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that OPM give agencies more flexibility in the enrollment and change in enrollment rules.
OPM is currently developing regulations that would bring much greater flexibility to the rules for enrolling in FEHB
plans and for changing FEHB enrollments. We expect to issue these as proposed regulations within the next few months.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asked how these regulations would apply to decisions on FEGLI and FEHB issues previously handled solely
by the agency or the retirement system (for example, whether an employee meets the requirements for continuing coverage
into retirement, whether a spouse meets the eligibility requirements for present or future benefits from the retirement
system, or whether an individual meets the requirements for FEHB coverage as a hostage under Public Law 101&hyph;513).
These regulations affect only reconsideration decisions that were previously made by OPM under &sect;870.205 and
&sect;890.104, which will now be made by the employing agencies (or retirement system, if appropriate) rather than
OPM. Agency and retirement system decisions made under other provisions are unaffected by these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asserted that, since OPM has the statutory authority to administer both of these programs and to enter
into contracts with carriers, these regulations constitute an abrogation of OPM's authority as plan sponsor. OPM
disagrees. Both the FEGLI and the FEHB laws are structured so that agencies perform the day-to-day functions necessary
to handle their employees' enrollments and enrollment changes. Although OPM has performed the reconsideration
function in the past, the law does not prohibit the delegation of this function to agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters expresses the concern that employees would not have their cases reviewed outside the agency. One of
these felt that, since FEGLI and FEHB decisions are not appealable to the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB), OPM
should review these cases because it is responsible for the policies on which they are based. The other felt that OPM
has the expertise necessary to resolve enrollment disputes that agencies lack, and that no change should be made unless
chapter 71 of title 5, U.S. Code, is amended to allow employees to grieve agency decisions on FEGLI and FEHB enrollment
issues. It is true that FEGLI and FEHB decisions are not subject to review by the Merit Systems Protection Board nor
may they be grieved under chapter 71 of title 5, U.S. Code. We believe that, for the most part, agencies already have
the expertise necessary to make these decisions and that a level of administrative review that is independent of the
agency is unnecessary. OPM will provide guidance and other assistance to agencies in setting up procedures for making
reconsideration decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that we set a time limit on the length of the retroactive period that agencies may authorize.
We do not believe that setting an arbitrary time limit would be appropriate. A retroactive correction must be based
on an administrative error and the employee must request a retroactive correction. The agency must consider each
case on its own merits. Most requests for retroactive correction are for FEHB enrollment issues. Generally, these
are self-limiting in terms of the length of the retroactive period because carriers generally require that claims
be made no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the one in which the medical service was provided. However,
we recognize that agencies do not have experience in granting retroactive corrections; therefore, we are modifying
the FEHB regulations so that they apply only to retroactive corrections of administrative errors that occur after
December 31, 1994.

One commenter requested that OPM provide guidance to help them develop procedures and allow sufficient lead time
for them to do this. OPM will provide guidance to help agencies set up procedures; however, agencies will find that
the reconsideration function is not difficult. They have been making the initial decisions on prospective corrections
for many years, and reconsideration decisions are similar. We do not believe that a lengthy delay is necessary with
regard to prospective corrections. The modification we are making in the regulation to limit retroactive corrections
of administrative errors occurring after December 31, 1994, will have a delaying effect on decisions regarding retroactive
corrections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that we change the proposed regulations at 5 CFR 870.102 to read ``The employing office may
make 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
prospective and retroactive
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 corrections *&blank;*&blank;*'' to conform to the language in 5 CFR 890.103. The difference in language is intentional.
Under current regulations, an agency's failure to withhold Basic Life insurance premiums is always corrected retroactively
because coverage is automatic unless the employee submits a waiver. Similarly, an agency's failure to process a waiver
on a timely basis is retroactive to the effective date of the waiver. Since agencies are not free to make a judgment as
to whether the change should be retroactive in these cases, it is not appropriate for the regulations to imply that
they do. However, the language of the FEGLI regulations does not preclude either prospective or retroactive changes
that do not conflict with the law or regulations. In the case of FEHB enrollments, the agency is generally free to make
a judgment as to whether a prospective or retroactive change is appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that we clarify whether OPM's decision to order a retroactive correction is subject to retroactive
payment of premiums under &sect;&sect;870.102 and 890.103. Since retroactive payment of premiums is required under
the law, it has been OPM's practice to include the requirement for payment of retroactive premiums in its letters to
the agencies ordering the retroactive correction. However, we are modifying the regulations to make it clear that
the requirement for payment of retroactive premiums applies regardless of who authorizes the retroactive correction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that we change the requirements for the information that must be included in an employee's
request for reconsideration to include a copy of the initial decision. We have intentionally not included a copy of
the initial decision as a regulatory requirement. This information should be given in the initial decision itself;
however, we do not agree that the copy of the initial decision need be included for the request to be considered timely
under the regulations. If the request includes sufficient information to identify the individual, it can be accepted
as a timely request and the initial decision can be requested if it is not included.

One commenter suggested that &sect;&sect;870.103(c)(2) and 890.104(c)(2) be changed to specify that the reconsideration
review is an independent level of review. We are making this modification in the interest of clarity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asked how these regulations apply to agencies that have previously delegated initial decisions to
another agency through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). Such agencies may need to amend the MOU's to show which
agency is to make the reconsideration decision. Currently the initial decision letters have been directing employees
to ask OPM to reconsider the initial decision. Under the revised regulations the initial decision must tell the employee
how to seek reconsideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter expressed the concern that the term ``agency'' used in &sect;890.104 could restrict the agency's options
about the role of the National Finance Center (NFC) in the reconsideration process for those agencies that have a MOU
with NFC to administer their payroll or FEHB accounts for enrollees who make direct premium payments. Since NFC acts
as an agent for the agency, these regulations in no way restrict NFC's role. However, agencies and NFC will need to decide
which will perform the reconsideration function and then modify the MOU accordingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the comments we received indicated that agencies are uncertain about what reconsideration actually
is. Therefore, we are adding a definition of the term ``reconsideration'' to clarify that it is the final part of the
administrative review process and consists of a determination of whether the law and regulations were correctly
applied when the initial decision was made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, there were several suggestions to correct real or perceived technical or typographical errors in the

An employing office's decision is considered an initial decision as used in paragraph (a) of this section when rendered
by the employing office in writing and stating the right to an independent level of review (reconsideration) by the
agency or retirement system. However, an initial decision rendered at the highest level of review available within
OPM is not subject to reconsideration.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A request for reconsideration of an initial decision must be filed within 30 calendar days from the date of the written
decision stating the right to a reconsideration. The time limit on filing may be extended when the individual shows
that he or she was not notified of the time limit and was not otherwise aware of it, or that he or she was prevented by circumstances
beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit. An agency or retirement system decision in
response to a request for reconsideration of an employing office's decision is a final decision as described in paragraph
(e) of this section.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Rural Telephone Bank (RTB) and the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) hereby amend the regulations originally published
by the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) and by the RTB. These amendments revise nomenclature in order
to implement recent legislation directing the Secretary of Agriculture to establish the Rural Utilities Service
(RUS), with responsibility for the electric and telephone loan programs formerly administered by REA, including
loan programs of the RTB. Nomenclature changes to regulations affecting other programs administered by RUS, including
water and waste facility loan and grant programs and certain other programs previously administered by the former
Rural Development Administration and the former Farmers Home Administration will be published separately. The
amendments published in this document consist solely of nomenclature changes required by law and of amendments necessary
to conform to these nomenclature changes. The substance of the regulations is not affected by these amendments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;354,
108 Stat. 3178) (Reorganization Act) signed by President Clinton on October 13, 1994, provides for a streamlining
and reorganizing of the Department of Agriculture (Department). The Reorganization Act requires the Secretary
of Agriculture (Secretary) to establish the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) within the Department. On October 20,
1994, the Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary), in Secretary's Memorandum 1010&hyph;1, abolished the Rural Electrification
Administration (REA) and established RUS, as required by the Reorganization Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The functions of RUS include, among other things, administration of the electric and telephone loan programs authorized
by the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 U.S.C. 901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (RE Act) and of the water and waste facility loan and grant programs authorized by various laws. The rights, interests,
obligations, duties, and assets of REA have been vested in and transferred to RUS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to enhance the delivery of customer services, provide continuity of service, and minimize public confusion
about the administration and functions of the newly established agency, RUS is amending regulations originally
published by REA and by the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB) to replace references to REA and its officials with references
to RUS and to officials of the newly established agency. A few definitions are being revised to conform with the new
nomenclature. Additional regulations implementing other aspects of the reorganization of the Department of Agriculture
will be published at a later date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this action relates solely to agency organization, procedure, or practice, notice and comment is not required
prior to publication of this final rule. This final rule is published in accordance with the Reorganization Act.

the timely execution of RUS functions, this rule is effective immediately.

General.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) was established by Executive Order No. 7037, signed by the President
on May 11, 1935. Statutory authority was provided by the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (RE Act) (49 Stat. 1363;
7 U.S.C. 901). The RE Act established REA as a lending agency with responsibility for developing a program for rural
electrification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) On October 28, 1949, an amendment to the RE Act authorized REA to make loans to improve and extend telephone service
in rural areas. The Rural Telephone Bank (RTB or the Bank), an Agency of the United States, was established by another
amendment to the RE Act, approved May 7, 1971. The Administrator of RUS serves as the Bank's chief executive with the
title of Governor. On May 11, 1973, the RE Act was further amended to establish a revolving fund and to provide authority
for REA to guarantee loans made by other legally organized lenders. The RE Act was amended further on December 21, 1987,
to establish a Rural Economic Development Subaccount, and to authorize funds from this subaccount to provide zero-interest
loans and grants to REA borrowers to promote rural economic development and job creation. The RE Act was also amended
on November 5, 1990, to add a new section 314, which authorized REA to guarantee 90 percent of the principal and interest
of loans made for electric and telephone facilities by legally organized lenders. It was further amended on November
28, 1990, to establish an Assistant Administrator for Economic Development and a rural development technical assistance
unit; to expand the authorities and responsibilities of REA in rural economic development; and to establish a Rural
Business Incubator Fund for making grants and reduced interest loans to electric and telephone borrowers to promote
business incubator projects. At the same time, the Administrator was also granted authority for financial assistance
for distance learning and medical link programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Secretary of Agriculture (Secretary) was required to establish the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) pursuant
to section 232 of the Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994, (Pub.
L. 103&hyph;354, 108 Stat. 3178) (Reorganization Act). The Reorganization Act established RUS as successor to REA.
On October 20, 1994, the Secretary abolished REA and established RUS. RUS was assigned responsibility for administering
electric and telephone loan programs previously administered by REA, water and waste facility loans and grants previously
administered by the Rural Development Administration, along with other functions as the Secretary determines appropriate.
The rights, interests, obligations, duties, and contracts previously vested in REA are transferred to and vested
in RUS. The Secretary designated the Administrator of RUS to serve as the Governor of RTB. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The offices of RUS are located in the South Building of the United States Department of Agriculture at 14th and Independence
Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250&hyph;1500. The Electric and Telephone Programs are administered by regional
offices located at this same address. There is a Northern and a Southern Regional Office, along with a Power Supply
Division, for the electric program, and an Eastern and a Western Regional Office for the telephone program. (See &sect;1700.4(b)
and &sect;1700.5(b).)

CFSA is establishing a regulation whereby under the procedures of the Small Farmer Outreach Training and Technical
Assistance Program and the Outreach and Assistance Grants for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers Program,
an 1890 Land Grant Institution or other eligible educational institution or community-based organization could
enter into a cooperative or other agreement with CFSA to provide outreach, training, and technical assistance to
small-scale farmers, especially members of socially disadvantaged groups. This action is necessary to implement
the provisions in the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990, title XXV, Section 2501 and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) appropriation acts which provide funding for this program. The intended effect
of this action is to assist small farmers and socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers by making them aware of programs
available through the USDA. In addition, this rule amends 7 CFR chapter XVIII to reflect the abolishment of the Farmers
Home Administration and the Rural Development Administration and the establishment of the Rural Housing and Community
Development Service, the Rural Business and Cooperative Development Service, the Rural Utilities Service, and
the Consolidated Farm Service Agency in the recent Department of Agriculture reorganization.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In July 1993, Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) initiated, under Section 2501 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation,
and Trade Act of 1990, the Outreach and Assistance Grants for Socially Disadvantage Farmers and Ranchers program.
The program was established by an internal funds transfer, in the amount of $1 million received on August 13, 1993,
from Extension Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A Notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 2, 1993, [58 FR 35911&hyph;35914], Outreach and Assistance Grants for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and
Ranchers, and no adverse comments were received. The Notice was to solicit recipients and give guidance to eligible
applicants on submitting proposals for the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Interim Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Outreach and Assistance Grants for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers is authorized under Section 2501
of the Food Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 2279). Three million dollars will remain available
until expended. It was the intent of Congress to have funds available to provide outreach and technical assistance
to encourage and assist socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers to own and operate farms and ranches and to participate
in agricultural programs. This assistance should enable socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers to obtain
information on application and bidding procedures, farm management, and other essential information to participate
in agricultural programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of Agricultural programs contained in 1943.104 of this subpart is based on the programs authorized
by the statutes referenced in Section 2501 (e)(3) of the FACT Act. As authorized by Section 2501 (e)(3)(G), FmHA has
designated additional USDA programs as Agricultural program based on its belief that the participation of socially
disadvantaged farmers and ranchers in these programs will serve an important public purpose. The definition of Agricultural
program references many of USDA's programs, however, the list is not intended to be all inclusive. Rather, the regulation
intends to increase participation by socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers in all USDA programs which are
agricultural in nature. However, because the program is carried out by CFSA employees, the outreach efforts by CFSA
personnel to recipients will require the personnel to provide information about CFSA agricultural loans only until
such time as information on the other USDA agricultural programs becomes available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Need for the Interim Rule: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;To implement, this year, a program that directly addresses the decline of minority farmers and ranchers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To immediately put into effect what is a clear and pressing goal of the Administration. On November 1, 1993,
President Clinton issued Executive Order 12876, that directs the Government to support Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCU's) and to provide opportunities to participate in and benefit from federal programs. These
institutions are a major beneficiary of this funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In addition, under Section 2501, Outreach and Assistance for Socially Disadvantaged Farmers and Ranchers,
non-HBCU's entities, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Indian Tribal community colleges and Hispanic serving post-secondary educational institutions will be in the population
served. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;To allow funds to be used in FY 95 that will provide assistance in advance of planting and building for the upcoming
crop year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The application of this program will help in development of the components in the '95 Farm Bill aimed at stabilizing
socially disadvantaged family farmers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;As services are consolidated and agencies change as a result of reorganization of USDA, the socially disadvantaged
population, whom these funds are targeted at, will be able to receive the necessary assistance to understand and gain
access to the newly reorganized USDA.

It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts
will be published for comment not withstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553. However, the Department is publishing
this rule as an interim rule which will take effect immediately upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 without securing prior public comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is taking this action because the funds which will be distributed in the fiscal year 1995 are not being distributed
under a typically new action or proposal which will affect the public. Rather the funds will go to organizations whose
five years' plans were selected for funding pursuant to the July 2, 1993, Notice so that the organizations can continue
to provide information and assistance to socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. Moreover, since that Notice
provided the criteria for obtaining funding, the organizations which are affected by this action (which contains
similar requirements) have actual notice of the applicable standards.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Organizations whose proposals were not selected for funding in 1993 and organizations submitting new proposals
are not immediately affected by this action because they will not receive funding in this fiscal year. Also, these
organizations will have the opportunity to comment on the interim rule because their comments will be considered
before any truly new money could be distributed in the fiscal year 1996. Only $3,000,000 was appropriated for this
program for the fiscal year 1994, and $2,995,000 for the fiscal year 1995. The same amount may not be appropriated in
subsequent years. However, it is the Agency's expectation that funds will be appropriated for this program either
as a separate item or as part of the general appropriations for the Agency in the future years. Therefore, the interim
rule establishes guidelines for administering the program for future years.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The regulation being developed embodies the content of the original notice, published on July 2, 1993. The interested
parties are fully aware of the procedures and standards intended for this program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The program's objective is to reverse, through the use of the Outreach Training and Technical Assistance Program,
the decline of socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers across the United States.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;This outcome will be reached by encouraging and assisting socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers to
own and operate their own farms, participate in agricultural programs, and become an integral part of the agricultural
community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The recipients of these grants will provide services to socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers and small
farmers through outreach training and technical assistance in farm and ranch management, recordkeeping, marketing
techniques and in testing innovative solutions to existing or anticipated issues or problems they may encounter.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the interim rule, CFSA will solicit proposals, and five-year plans to be funded on a competitive basis. The solicitation
is encouraged from community-based organizations, 1890 Land Grant colleges, including Tuskegee University, Indian
Tribal Community Colleges and Alaska Native cooperative colleges, Hispanic serving post-secondary educational
institutions, and other post-secondary educational institutions with demonstrated experience in providing agriculture
education or other agricultural related services to socially disadvantaged family farmers and ranchers in their
region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposals will be evaluated by a panel of Agency technical experts to determine which proposals are most meritorious.
The panel of Agency technical experts are necessary to evaluate what is expected to be a variety of very technical proposals.
The evaluation panel will make recommendations to the appropriate Agency official to be forwarded to the Agency Head,
who will consult with, if necessary, the Secretary of USDA before a final decision on awarding the grants or cooperative
agreements is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assure a consistency in the evaluation process the interim rule establishes a set of evaluation criteria to assure
the proposal is consistent with the intent of the program and is worth the funds that are to be spent on the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The accounting for the funds awarded for the cooperative or other agreement will be subject to the normal rules for
such agreements within USDA as given in part 3016 of this title. The proposed application format is used to assure that
sufficient information is obtained to complete an agreement as given in part 3016 of this title. In addition, the application
format is similar to that used by other USDA Agencies for their competitive grants programs.

This subpart provides procedures for administration of the Small Farmer Outreach Training and Technical Assistance
Program whereby an 1890 or other eligible educational institution or community-based organization as referenced
in &sect;1943.105 of this subpart, also referred to as the recipient, enters into a grant, cooperative, or other agreement
with the Consolidated Farm Service Agency (CFSA) to provide outreach, training, and technical assistance to members
of socially disadvantaged groups to own and operate farms and ranches and to participate in agricultural programs.

(a) Recipients must establish safeguards to prevent employees, consultants, or members of governing bodies from
using their positions for purposes that are, or give the appearance of being, motivated by a desire for private financial
gain for themselves or others such as those with whom they have family, business, or other ties. Therefore, recipients
receiving financial support must have written policy guidelines on conflict of interest and the avoidance thereof.
These guidelines should reflect State and local laws and must cover financial interests, gifts, gratuities and favors,
nepotism, and other areas such as political participation and bribery. These rules must also indicate the conditions
under which outside activities, relationships, or financial interests are proper or improper, and provide for notification
of these kinds of activities, relationships, or financial interests to a responsible and objective recipient official.
For the requirements of a code of conduct applicable to procurements under grants and cooperative agreements, see
the procurement standards prescribed by 7 CFR 3015.181.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A copy of the rules of conduct must be given to each officer, employee, board member, and consultant of the recipient
who is working on the CFSA financed project, and the rules must be enforced to the extent permissible under State and
local law or to the extent to which the recipient determines it has legal and practical enforcement capacity. The rules
need not be formally submitted and approved by the awarding official; however, they must be made available for review
upon request, for example, during a site visit.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is amending provisions of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection
regulations to reduce the fees charged participants in the Agency's Accredited Laboratory Program (ALP). Non-Federal
analytical laboratories are qualified under the ALP to conduct analyses of official meat and poultry samples. Laboratory
accreditation fees that cover the costs of the ALP are mandated by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade
Act of 1990 (the 1990 Farm Bill), as amended. The same Act mandates annual payment of the fees on the anniversary date
of each accreditation. FSIS has determined that reduced ALP administrative expenditures for fiscal year 1995 will
enable the Agency to charge a smaller accreditation fee than last year. However, because the laboratory accreditation
fee is set forth in the regulations, the regulations must be changed before the Agency can charge a different fee. Since
the anniversary date of most current accreditations is December 13, FSIS would like to begin billing the laboratories
at the reduced rate on that date. FSIS is also making an editorial correction to the Federal meat and poultry products
inspection regulations.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
To assure compliance with the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA_21 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA_21 U.S.C. 451 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and regulations promulgated under the Acts, samples of meat and poultry products are tested periodically to determine
protein, moisture, fat, and salt content. Analyses are also conducted to determine the presence of any violative
concentrations of drugs or other chemical residues.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When FSIS finds that a product is not in compliance, the Agency is required to take appropriate action against the processor
of that product. Depending on the type of product and the severity of the noncompliance, such action may range from
product reprocessing to litigation proceedings. In view of the critical nature of product testing, it is necessary
for laboratories that analyze official samples of meat and poultry products to maintain a high degree of integrity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A processor whose sample is to be analyzed generally has the option of using either an FSIS laboratory or an accredited
laboratory. The cost of FSIS analysis is borne by the Government while the cost of non-Federal analysis is borne by
the processor. Due to the limited number of FSIS laboratories and their heavy workload, many processors prefer to
use the non-Federal laboratories either for convenience of location or to obtain test results more quickly.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1327 (7 U.S.C. 138f) of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (PL 101&hyph;624), as amended,
known as the 1990 Farm Bill, requires USDA to charge a nonrefundable accreditation fee for laboratories seeking accreditation
by the Secretary under the authority of the FMIA or PPIA. The fee is required to be in an amount that will offset the cost
of the ALP. All fees collected by the Secretary of Agriculture are credited to an account from which the expenses of
the Accredited Laboratory Program are paid, and are available immediately and remain available until expended for
the ALP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fees are billed annually on a per-accreditation basis. The ALP regulations define an accreditation to be a determination
by FSIS that a laboratory is qualified to analyze official samples of meat and poultry products for the presence and
amount of all four food chemistry analytes (protein, moisture, fat, and salt) or a determination by the Agency that
a laboratory is qualified to analyze official samples of product for the presence and amount of one of several classes
of chemical residues. Accreditations are granted separately for the food chemistry analysis of official samples
and for the analysis of such samples for any one of the several classes of chemical residue. A laboratory may hold more
than one accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The user-fee-funded ALP has been in operation since December 13, 1993, the effective date of the final rule that, among
other things, established the accreditation fee (58 FR 65254). FSIS has reviewed its costs incurred to grant and/or
renew a laboratory's accreditation status. A cost analysis was performed on the 1994 rate and it was determined that
the 1995 rate should be reduced. The revised fee was determined by an analysis of the fixed and variable costs of the
service. The cost was calculated to be $2,500 per year, a reduction of $1000 from the 1994 fee.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 This reduction was due to administrative and managerial efficiencies, and the use of interlaboratory accreditation
maintenance check samples only, rather than both check and split samples, to demonstrate acceptable laboratory
performance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A copy of the cost analysis is available from the FSIS Docket Clerk, USDA, Food Safety and Inspection Service, Room
3171, South Agriculture Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, Washington, DC 20250.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each year, FSIS will perform a cost analysis to determine whether the current accreditation fee is adequate to recover
the costs of providing the service for the next year. If the fee is not adequate or is in excess of that required to recover
the costs, a new fee will be established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has determined that the fee for original accreditations and renewals, beginning December 13, 1994 (the
anniversary date for the accreditations of most laboratories in the program), will be $2,500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the amount of the accreditation fee is mandated by regulation, the regulations must be amended before laboratories
can be billed at the new, reduced rate. As the regulations are now written, the Agency must begin billing December 13
at the existing, higher fee rate of $3,500. However, the Agency has determined that a lower fee should be charged. The
Agency has determined that the lower fee needs to be made effective immediately in order to assure that it collects
the fee it has determined is appropriate and in order to assure that industry will not be burdened unnecessarily by
the charging of a fee that is higher than what is needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FSIS is also making an editorial correction to &sect;318.21(c)(3)(ix), paragraphs (A), (B), and (C), and &sect;381.153(c)(3)(ix),
paragraphs (A), (B), and (C), of the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations. In the final rule,
the option for using interlaboratory accreditation check samples was inadvertently omitted from these paragraphs
but included in the introductory sections for these paragraphs. This interim rule merely corrects that editorial
error and makes no substantive change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), for the reasons listed above, the
Agency finds good cause for making this interim rule effective upon publication. At the same time, however, FSIS is
providing for a 30-day comment period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule reduces the accreditation
fees for non-Federal analytical chemistry laboratories accredited under the Federal Meat and Poultry Products
Inspection Acts and regulations promulgated thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States and local jurisdictions are preempted under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the Poultry Products
Inspection Act (PPIA) from imposing any requirements with respect to federally inspected premises and facilities,
and operations of such establishments, that are in addition to, or different than, those imposed under the FMIA or
PPIA. States and local jurisdictions are also preempted under the FMIA and PPIA from imposing any marking, labeling,
packaging, or ingredient requirements on federally inspected meat or poultry products that are in addition to, or
different than, those imposed under the FMIA or the PPIA, as well as preempted from imposing, under the PPIA for poultry
products, certain storage and handling requirements. States and local jurisdictions may, however, exercise concurrent
jurisdiction over meat and poultry products that are outside official establishments for the purpose of preventing
the distribution of meat or poultry products that are misbranded or adulterated under the FMIA or PPIA or, in the case
of imported articles, which are not at such an establishment, after their entry into the United States. States and
local jurisdictions may also make requirements or take other actions, that are consistent with the FMIA and PPIA,
with respect to any other matters regulated under the FMIA and PPIA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the FMIA and the PPIA, States that maintain meat and poultry inspection programs must impose requirements that
are at least equal to those required under the FMIA or PPIA. These States may, however, impose more stringent requirements
on such State-inspected products and establishments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule will have no retroactive effect and applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted before
any judicial challenge to the application of these provisions. Those administrative procedures are set forth in
9 CFR &sect;&sect;306.5, 318.21(h), 381.35, and 381.153(h).

There are currently approximately 150 laboratories in the FSIS accredited laboratory program. About one quarter
(37) of these are considered small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This interim rule reduces the fee charged for FSIS accreditation from $3,500 per accreditation, per year, to $2,500
per accreditation, per year. All small accredited laboratories are affected by this interim rule. Since the payment
of fees to begin or renew a laboratory's status as ``accredited by FSIS'' is a very small part of total business costs,
FSIS has determined that this rule will not have a significant effect on small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101
airplanes, that currently requires inspections to detect damage of the ball bearings in the aileron quadrants, replacement
of damaged ball bearings with new ball bearings, and adjustment to the secondary stops. This amendment requires installation
of new swivel bearings in the aileron quadrants, which, when accomplished, will terminate the inspection requirement.
This amendment is prompted by the development of a modification that eliminates the need to inspect repetitively.
The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the bearings in the aileron quadrants, which could
result in reduced controllability of the airplane.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) by superseding AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10,
Amendment 39&hyph;8849 (59 FR 11531, March 11, 1994), which is applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes,
was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 4, 1994 (59 FR 23031). The action proposed to require installation of new swivel bearings in the left and right
aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A) as terminating action for the currently required inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact
of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined
that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work hour.
The economic impact information, below has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances,
at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary,
all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify this requirement. The FAA has
determined that this addition will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of
the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 8 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inspections that were previously required by AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, and retained in this amendment, take approximately
1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of these inspection requirements on U.S. operators is estimated to be $480, or $60 per airplane, per inspection
cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adjustment to the secondary stops that were previously required by AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, and retained in this
amendment, take approximately 1 work hour per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this adjustment requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $480,
or $60 per airplane. The FAA estimates that all affected U.S. operators have already accomplished this action; therefore,
the future cost impact of this requirement is minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The installation of new swivel bearings (Modification JM41307A) that will be required by this amendment will take
approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour. Required parts
will be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operator. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the
modification requirement of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,800, or $600 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to
the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of
the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (e) to request
approval from the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe
condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should
include an assessment of the effect of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no
case does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this
AD.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 series airplanes,
that requires inspection to detect cracking in the area of the side stay attachment lugs of the fitting subassembly
of the main landing gear (MLG), and replacement of cracked subassemblies with new or serviceable subassemblies.
This amendment is prompted by reports of cracking in the subassembly of the MLG. The actions specified by this AD are
intended to prevent damage to and/or failure of the support structure of the MLG.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F&hyph;28 Mark 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 series airplanes was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 5, 1994 (59 FR 15875). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection to detect cracking in the area
of the side stay attachment lugs of the fitting subassembly of the main landing gear (MLG), and replacement of cracked
subassemblies with new or serviceable subassemblies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the proposed rule be withdrawn and that a supplemental notice be issued that would propose
the accomplishment of a ``refurbishment'' program developed by the commenter. This commenter indicates that the
inspection and rework proposed in the notice may actually aggravate, rather than prevent, damage to the subject fitting
assemblies. This commenter reports that, within several days after reworking the lugs in accordance with the method
proposed in the notice, corrosion damage indications reappeared. In order to ensure that all evidence of corrosion
was removed, the commenter had to accomplish an intensive refurbishment of the main landing gear side stay attachment
lugs. It is this refurbishment process that the commenter requests to be required by the proposed rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not agree with the commenter's request. The commenter did not provide sufficient data to establish that
the procedure required by this rule (namely, a cleaning procedure that is necessary to remove surface corrosion in
order to obtain an adequate eddy current inspection) contributes to any aggravation of a corrosion condition. The
FAA has determined that the cleaning and eddy current inspection are sufficient, if no cracks are detected, to allow
the main fitting sub-assembly to remain on the airplane until the next overhaul, when a thorough inspection, corrosion
removal, and corrosion control process can be accomplished.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter requests that the proposed AD be revised to provide ``credit'' for inspections accomplished
during overhaul procedures that were performed prior to the effective date of the final rule. The commenter points
out that Revision 2 of Fokker F28 Service Experience Digest 32&hyph;10, Subject No. 008, states that, if the inspection
and restoration of the protective finish on the subject assembly are accomplished, as is recommended during the inspections
called out in the referenced service bulletin or during normal overhaul, no repetitive inspections will be necessary
between overhaul periods. The commenter considers that this implies that the damage to the anodic film is an isolated
occurrence, and that stress corrosion cracking will not occur if the anodic film is intact when the unit enters service.
The commenter states that, compared to a specialized shop environment, field inspections and rework operations
(as proposed in the notice) are less likely to ensure that all corrosion is detected and removed. Further, rework that
exposes end grains and increases stress levels can aggravate, rather than arrest, the propensity for further corrosion.
In this commenter's overhaul shop, corrosion removal is verified after machining by a process beginning with a chemical
etch treatment that removes the surfaced layer of metal smeared by machining, followed by a high-sensitivity fluorescent
penetrant inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA concurs in part. Although the Fokker F28 Service Experience Digest referenced by the commenter does state
that accomplishment of normal overhaul ``will ensure that no repetitive inspections are required between overhaul
periods,'' the overhaul instructions provided may not be entirely adequate to support that statement. Therefore,
the FAA agrees with the commenter's suggestion to provide credit to operators for inspections that were accomplished
during overhaul prior to the effective date of the AD, but only provided that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The overhaul was accomplished within the normal overhaul period (12,000 cycles or 12 years, whichever comes first);
and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The overhaul was accomplished in accordance with Dowty Aerospace Landing Gear (DALG) Component Maintenance Manual
(CMM), dated September 1977 or later; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Any resulting repairs were accomplished in accordance with the DALG CMM, dated November 25, 1992, or later; or,
if repairs were accomplished after September 1977 but before November 25, 1992, they were performed with concurrence
(concession) from DALG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule, to provide such ``credit'' to operators who have performed this
procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the proposed rule be revised to permit the installation of uninspected (non-identified)
subassemblies after the effective date of the AD and until the compliance time for inspection, which is 3 months after
the effective date. This commenter points out that the proposal would require that, as of the effective date of the
final rule, no operator could install any subassembly that had not been previously inspected and identified in accordance
with the requirements of proposed paragraph (a). The commenter is concerned that this would not allow the installation
of an uninspected serviceable part during maintenance that was not related to the AD itself. The commenter states
that this does not appear to be consistent with previous AD's that have dealt with affected parts not installed on an
airplane.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. Neither does the FAA agree that this is ``not consistent with
previous AD's.'' The FAA has issued numerous AD's over the past years that have called for the removal of discrepant
parts that have been determined to create an unsafe condition; those AD's normally contain a statement indicating
that none of those discrepant-type parts may be installed on any airplane in the future. Such statements are necessary
in order to prohibit the installation of spares of the discrepant part. In general, once an unsafe condition has been
determined to exist with regard to a part, it is the FAA's normal policy not to allow that condition_or that part_to
be re-introduced into the fleet.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, in developing the technical information on which every AD is based, one of the important considerations
is the availability of parts that the AD will require to be installed. When it is determined that ample numbers of those
(safe) parts are immediately available to operators, it is the FAA's policy to prohibit installation of the ``unsafe''
parts after the effective date of the AD. Removing an unsafe condition that already exists on an airplane necessarily
involves performing maintenance on the airplane, and the FAA always provides some kind of ``grace period'' in order
to minimize disruption of operations. On the other hand, prohibiting installation of spares that have been determined
to create an unsafe condition does not require any additional maintenance activity; it simply requires use of one
part rather than another.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Put in other terms, the purpose of the AD's compliance time is to give the operators time to get the discrepant parts

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
off
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the airplane. The time interval selected takes into account not only safety implications, but the size of the fleet
and convenient maintenance schedules. However, the compliance time is not meant as a time for operators to put discrepant
parts 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
on
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the airplane in the meantime.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the FAA considers that the period of time between publication of the final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and the effective date of the final rule (usually 30 days) is sufficient to provide operators with an opportunity to
determine their immediate need for modified spares and to obtain them. Of course, in individual cases where this is
not possible, every AD contains a provision that allows an operator to obtain an extension of compliance time based
upon a specific showing of need.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of these issues, the FAA finds that prohibiting installation of uninspected (non-identified) subassemblies
on an airplane as of the effective date of this final rule does increase safety and does not impose undue burdens on operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to the final rule to clarify this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact
of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined
that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work hour.
The economic impact information, below, has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments above, the FAA has determined that air safety and
the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The AA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 42 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 14
work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based
on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $35,280, or $840 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has
been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been
modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator
must use the authority provided in paragraph (d) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either
no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address
the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed
configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration,
or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes, that requires repetitive inspections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the passenger service unit (PSU) printed circuit boards and power supply connectors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detect corrosion and evidence of overheating; repair or replacement of the circuit boards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or replacement of connectors, if necessary; and eventual installation of a terminating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification. This amendment is prompted by reports that certain PSU printed circuit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boards and power supply connectors have overheated in service. The actions specified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this AD are intended to prevent overheating of the PSU printed circuit board and power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supply connectors, which could lead to a fire in the PSU.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to certain de Havilland Model DHC&hyph;8 series airplanes was published as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
April 29, 1994 (59 FR 22138). That action proposed to require repetitive inspections of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the passenger service unit (PSU) printed circuit boards and power supply connectors to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detect corrosion and evidence of overheating; repair or replacement of the circuit boards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or replacement of connectors, if necessary; and eventual installation of a modification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would terminate the required inspections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter requests that the proposed requirement to submit inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results to de Havilland be deleted. The commenter states that, since the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would require that a terminating action be accomplished, and since de Havilland has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aware of the addressed problem for several years, any data supplied to de Havilland 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through inspection reports would not shed any new light on the problem. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concurs. Upon reconsideration of this proposed requirement, the FAA considers the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submission of reports to be unnecessary. Additionally, de Havilland has advised the FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it foresees no future need to receive such reports. Accordingly, the FAA has revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule by deleting the reporting requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This same commenter requests that the compliance time for the proposed initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection be revised to account for new airplanes. The commenter suggests that new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes should not be required to be inspected for at least 12 months since new. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering this comment, the FAA has determined that the applicability of the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be revised to limit it only to airplanes having serial numbers 3 through 369, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusive. Airplanes having serial numbers higher that 369 were delivered with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent of Modification 8/1950 (the terminating modification required by this AD) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
installed. In light of this, a revision to the final rule to address ``new'' airplanes, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested by the commenter, is unnecessary since all of the affected airplanes have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulated more than 12 months since new. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has revised the applicability of the final rule to clarify the specific part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers of the subject PSU's installed on the affected airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in calculating the economic impact of AD activity. In order to account for various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined that it is necessary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hour. The economic impact information, below, has been revised to reflect this increase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the specified hourly labor rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined that these changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 133 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The required inspections will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total cost impact of the proposed inspections on U.S. operators is estimated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$15,960, or $120 per airplane, per inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The required terminating modification will require approximately 3 work hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per PSU to accomplish, at an average labor cost of $60 per work hour. Required parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would cost approximately $62 per PSU. Each airplane is equipped with between 18 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
26 PSU's. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed modification on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. operators is estimated to be $242 per PSU, or between $4,356 and $6,292 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figures discussed above are based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. However, the FAA has been advised that the initial inspection has already been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished on approximately 22 airplanes; therefore the future economic impact of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule is reduced by at least $2,640.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment supersedes an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Robinson Helicopter Company
(RHC) Model R44 series helicopters, that currently requires removal and replacement of specific parts of the cyclic
control system. This amendment requires the same removal and replacement of specific parts of the cyclic control
system, corrects a replacement part number, and changes the applicability to cover certain serial-numbered helicopters.
This amendment is prompted by the need to correct the existing AD by changing the applicability to include additional
serial-numbered helicopters and to correct a replacement part number that was incorrectly stated in the existing
AD. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the cyclic control system and subsequent loss
of control of the helicopter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 18, 1994, the FAA issued AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;18, Amendment 39&hyph;9013 (59 FR 43726, August 25, 1994),
to require immediate removal and replacement of specific parts of the cyclic control system in accordance with the
applicable maintenance manual. That action was prompted by an accident involving an RHC Model R44 series helicopter.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined the probable cause for the accident was fatigue failure
of the cyclic stick assembly, a part of the cyclic control system. The pilot uses the cyclic control system to control
the flight attitude of the helicopter. If the cyclic control system fails, the pilot loses the ability to make cyclic
control inputs to the main rotor system. After reviewing the NTSB report, the FAA has determined that certain parts
of the same design as those installed on the accident helicopter need to be replaced before further flight. That condition,
if not corrected, could result in failure of the cyclic control system and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has become aware of an error in the AD. One of the cyclic control system replacement
part numbers was incorrectly stated as C211&hyph;3. That part number should have been part number A211&hyph;3. Additionally,
that AD should have been applicable to RHC Model R44 series helicopters, with serial numbers (S/N) less than but not
including S/N 0017, since the manufacturing records indicate the design changes required by that AD were incorporated
by RHC into the RHC Model R44 production line, beginning with helicopter S/N 0017. Upon review, the FAA has determined
that the original cyclic control system design meets existing FAA design standards, but has limited damage tolerance
characteristics and does not display slow crack growth properties. When damaged or flawed, the cyclic stick assembly
can fail due to fatigue prior to its retirement time of 4,000 hours time-in-service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other RHC Model R44 series helicopters
of the same type design, this AD supersedes AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;18 and is being issued to prevent failure of the cyclic
control system and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. This AD requires removal and replacement of certain
parts of the cyclic control system of the affected helicopters as well as changes the applicability of this AD to include
certain serial-numbered helicopters. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the applicable
maintenance manual. Due to the critical need to (1) ensure the integrity of the cyclic control system, (2) comply with
the requirements of this AD before further flight, and (3) require replacement of certain parts on certain serial-numbered
helicopters, this rule must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in the affected helicopters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications
should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the
rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the
closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each
FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit
a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;18&hyph;AD.''
The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.

The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct
an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866.
It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be
significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed
in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe
125&hyph;1000A series airplanes, that requires modification of the galley feeder cables and toilet services fuse.
This amendment is prompted by a report that the gauge size of the existing galley feeder cable is not compatible with
the rating of the currently used toilet services fuse. The actions specified by this AD are intended to ensure that
the subject cables are compatible with the toilet services fuse in order to prevent overheating of the cables, which
could result in smoke and fire in the cabin.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Raytheon Corporate Jets Model BAe 125&hyph;1000A series airplanes was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 5, 1994 (59 FR 34396). That action proposed to require modification of the galley feeder cables and toilet services
fuse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments
were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact
of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined
that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work hour.
The economic impact information, below has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. Under these circumstances,
at least one operator appears to have incorrectly assumed that its airplane was not subject to an AD. On the contrary,
all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been added to this final rule to clarify this requirement. The FAA has
determined that this addition will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of
the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 4 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 16 work
hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required
parts will cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators
is estimated to be $5,840, or $1,460 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities
under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is
contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

 This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has
been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been
modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator
must use the authority provided in paragraph (c) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either
no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address
the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed
configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration,
or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD.

1. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 1374 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (Code) generally imposes a corporate-level tax on an S corporation's
recognition of income or gain to the extent the income or gain reflects unrealized appreciation (or its equivalent)
in the corporation when it converted from C to S status. Section 1374 was amended to provide this treatment as part of
the legislation repealing the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General Utilities 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
rule. See H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 841, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., Vol. II, 198&hyph;207 (1986), 1986&hyph;3 C.B., Vol. 4, 198&hyph;207.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1374 generally applies to an S corporation for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, but only if
the corporation elects S status after December 31, 1986. Sections 1374(e) and 337(d) provide specific authority
to promulgate regulations under section 1374.

Proposed regulations under section 1374 were published in the

2. Section 1374 and the Proposed Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1374(a) imposes a tax on an S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year beginning in
the 10-year recognition period following the S corporation's conversion from a C corporation or acquisition of C
corporation assets in a carryover basis transaction. The proposed regulations provide that an S corporation's net
recognized built-in gain for any taxable year is the least of (1) its taxable income determined by using the rules applying
to C corporations and considering only recognized built-in gain and recognized built-in loss (the pre-limitation
amount), (2) its taxable income determined by using the rules applying to C corporations and considering all items
except as provided under section 1375(b)(1)(B) (the taxable income limitation), or (3) the excess of its net unrealized
built-in gain over net recognized built-in gain for all prior taxable years in the recognition period (the net unrealized
built-in gain limitation).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1374(d)(3) provides that any gain recognized on the disposition of an asset during the recognition period
is recognized built-in gain except to the extent the S corporation establishes that it did not hold the asset on the
first day of the recognition period or the asset appreciated after that day. Section 1374(d)(4) provides that any
loss recognized on a disposition of an asset during the recognition period is recognized built-in loss to the extent
the S corporation establishes that it held the asset on the first day of the recognition period and the asset depreciated
before that day. The proposed regulations provide that sections 1374(d) (3) and (4) apply only to transactions treated
as sales or exchanges under the Code.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1374(d)(5)(A) provides that any item of income properly taken into account during the recognition period
but attributable to periods before the first day of the recognition period is recognized built-in gain. Section 1374(d)(5)(B)
provides that any item of deduction properly taken into account during the recognition period but attributable to
periods before the first day of the recognition period is recognized built-in loss. The proposed regulations provide
that an S corporation's items of income or deduction generally are recognized built-in gain or loss if the item would
have been included in gross income or allowed as a deduction against gross income before the recognition period by
an accrual method taxpayer (accrual method rule). The proposed regulations provide that all rules applying to accrual
method taxpayers (whether from the Code, regulations, administrative pronouncements, or otherwise) also apply
for purposes of the accrual method rule with two exceptions: (1) Section 461(h)(2)(C), relating to liabilities for
tort and worker's compensation for which payment constitutes economic performance, and (2) section 469, relating
to suspended passive activity losses. The proposed regulations also provide special rules for certain items including
an S corporation's section 481(a) adjustments, income reported under the completed contract method, income reported
under the installment method, and distributive share of partnership items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1374(d)(1) provides that an S corporation's net unrealized built-in gain is the amount by which the fair market
value of all its assets exceeds the aggregate adjusted bases of all its assets as of the beginning of the recognition
period. Section 1374(d)(5)(C) provides that an S corporation's net unrealized built-in gain is properly adjusted
for items of income and deduction that would be recognized built-in gain or loss if taken into account during the recognition
period. The proposed regulations provide that the S corporation's net unrealized built-in gain is determined by
reference to a hypothetical sale of all the assets of the corporation immediately before the beginning of the recognition
period to a buyer that assumed all the corporation's liabilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1374(b)(2) provides that an S corporation's net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards
arising in years for which the corporation was a C corporation are allowed as deductions against net recognized built-in
gain. The proposed regulations provide that no other loss carryforwards may be used as a deduction against net recognized
built-in gain. Section 1374(b)(3) provides that an S corporation's special fuels credit for the year, and business
credit carryforwards and minimum tax credit arising in years for which the corporation was a C corporation, are allowed
as credits against the section 1374 tax. The proposed regulations provide that no other credits or credit carryforwards
may be used as a credit against the section 1374 tax. The loss carryforwards, credits, and credit carryforwards allowed
to reduce the section 1374 tax are collectively referred to as the section 1374 attributes in the final regulations.

3. Public Comments and the Final Regulations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The IRS received written and oral comments from the public on the proposed regulations both in connection with the
public hearing held on April 28, 1993, and otherwise. The issues raised by these comments are discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Accounting Methods
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commentators request guidance about the accounting methods an S corporation should use in determining its pre-limitation
amount and taxable income limitation. The commentators suggest that an S corporation should be allowed to use any
accounting method it could use if it were a C corporation. The final regulations do not adopt this suggestion because
section 1374 applies only to items an S corporation actually takes into account during the recognition period. It
does not apply to items the corporation would have taken into account under a hypothetical method of accounting. Accordingly,
the final regulations require the S corporation to use the accounting methods it actually uses as an S corporation
to make these taxable income determinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Recognition Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commentators request confirmation that the recognition period is the 10 calendar year period (and not the 10 taxable
year period) beginning on the first day the corporation is an S corporation or the day the S corporation acquires C corporation
assets in a carryover basis transaction. The final regulations confirm the commentators' interpretation of the
Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commentators also request guidance on determining an S corporation's net recognized built-in gain where the recognition
period ends during a taxable year (for example, because a corporation converting from C to S status was on a fiscal year
as a C corporation and changed to a calendar year as an S corporation or because an S corporation acquired C corporation
assets in a carryover basis transaction during a taxable year). The final regulations provide that the pre-limitation
amount for the year is determined by a closing of the books at the end of the recognition period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Accrual Method Rule and Section 267(a)(2) or 404(a)(5)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commentator argues that the proposed regulations should not use the accrual method rule to determine if, and the
extent to which, an item of income or deduction is included in net recognized built-in gain. Instead, this commentator
argues that the approach the proposed regulations use to determine if, and the extent to which, an item of income or
deduction is included in net unrealized built-in gain (that is, by valuation using a hypothetical sale of all the S
corporation's assets to a buyer that assumes all the S corporation's liabilities) should also be used to determine
if, and the extent to which, an item of income or deduction is included in net recognized built-in gain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Treasury and the IRS believe that separately valuing each item of income and deduction for net recognized built-in
gain purposes would be unduly burdensome both for taxpayers and for the IRS. Using a valuation approach for determining
net unrealized built-in gain is not unduly burdensome because net unrealized built-in gain can be determined by valuing
the S corporation's business using an aggregate approach where particular items of income and deduction are not valued
individually. In addition, many S corporations subject to section 1374 will not need to know their net unrealized
built-in gain because they will not approach their net unrealized built-in gain limitation in the recognition period.
However, most S corporations subject to section 1374 will have items of income and deduction taken into account in
the recognition period where a determination must be made if, and the extent to which, the item is included in net recognized
built-in gain. Accordingly, the final regulations do not adopt the commentator's suggestion and generally retain
the accrual method rule in the proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commentators argue that the accrual method rule in the proposed regulations wrongly applies sections 267(a)(2),
relating to accrued amounts payable to related persons, and 404(a)(5), relating to accrued amounts payable as deferred
compensation, to determine whether an item of deduction should be treated as a recognized built-in loss. In general,
those sections defer a deduction for an accrual method taxpayer that owes a payment to a cash method taxpayer until
the payment is made. The commentators cite the following statement in the section 1374 legislative history in support
of their position:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
As an example of these built-in gain and loss provisions, in the case of a cash basis personal service corporation that
converts to S status and that has receivables at the time of the conversion, the receivables, when received, are built-in
gain items. At the same time, built-in losses would include otherwise deductible compensation paid after the conversion
to the persons who performed the services that produced the receivables, to the extent such compensation is attributable
to such pre-conversion services. To the extent such built-in loss items offset the built-in gains from the receivables,
there would be no amount subject to the built-in gains tax.

H.R. Rep. No. 795, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 63&hyph;64 (1988). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The commentators suggest that the accrual method rule in the final regulations should be applied without regard to
sections 267(a)(2) and 404(a)(5). The Treasury and the IRS disagree with the commentators that the legislative history
quoted above precludes the adoption of the accrual method rule of the proposed regulations. The accrual method rule
in the proposed regulations was adopted as an administrable method for both taxpayers and the Service to determine
the extent to which an amount included in income or deducted in the recognition period is attributable to the pre-recognition
period. Nevertheless, in response to the commentators' requests, the final regulations extend recognized built-in
loss treatment for certain amounts properly deducted under section 267(a)(2) or 404(a)(5) in the recognition period.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations provide that an amount properly deducted under section 267(a)(2) is recognized built-in loss
to the extent (i) all events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount
of the liability can be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period, and (ii) the amount is paid in the
first two and one-half months of the recognition period, or is paid to an individual that owned less than 5 percent of
the corporation's stock. The final regulations provide that an amount properly deducted under section 404(a)(5)
is recognized built-in loss to the extent (i) all events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay
the amount, and the exact amount of the liability can be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period,
and (ii) the amount is not deductible under section 267(a)(2). The Treasury and the IRS believe that these rules are
relatively easy for taxpayers and the IRS to apply and also provide relief from the deferral of deductions under section
267(a)(2) or 404(a)(5). The additional limitations for amounts deducted under section 267(a)(2) are needed because
of the particular difficulty in determining whether amounts paid to related parties are attributable to services
performed before or after the beginning of the recognition period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations also modify the accrual method rule in the proposed regulations as follows: (1) An exception
from the accrual method rule for items deducted under &sect;1.461&hyph;4(g) is added (relating to items in addition
to those specified in section 461(h)(2)(C) for which payment constitutes economic performance); and (2) the exception
from the accrual method rule in the proposed regulations for items deducted under section 469 is eliminated. The &sect;1.461&hyph;4(g)
exception is added to clarify the section 461(h)(2)(C) exception in the proposed regulations. The section 469 exception
is eliminated because losses suspended before the recognition period under section 469 cannot be used in the recognition
period under section 1371(b)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Section 481 Adjustments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations provide that any item of income or deduction properly taken into account during the recognition
period under section 481 is recognized built-in gain or loss if the item is taken into account because of a change of
accounting method effective before the beginning of the second year of the recognition period (``one-year rule'').
In certain cases, this one-year rule has the effect of (1) omitting income attributable to the corporation's C period
altogether at the corporate level, (2) including income attributable to the corporation's C period twice at the corporate
level, (3) omitting a deduction attributable to the corporation's C period altogether at the corporate level, or
(4) allowing a deduction attributable to the corporation's C period twice at the corporate level, because the section
481 adjustment on the change in accounting method is not treated as recognized built-in gain or loss. In addition,
the Treasury and the Service believe that in most cases the portion of a section 481(a) adjustment attributable to
the pre-recognition period and the portion attributable to the recognition period can be determined without undue
administrative difficulty.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final regulations, therefore, provide that any section 481(a) adjustment taken into account in the recognition
period that prevents an omission or duplication of income or deduction is recognized built-in gain or loss to the extent
the adjustment relates to items attributable to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the
principles for determining recognized built-in gain or loss in the regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Installment Method
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations impose a section 1374 tax on income reported under the installment method either during
or after the recognition period in accordance with Notice 90&hyph;27, 1990&hyph;1 C.B. 336. The tax is imposed only
to the extent the income would have been included in net recognized built-in gain if it had been reported in the year
of the sale and all provisions of section 1374 applied including the taxable income limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commentators argue that the proposed regulations wrongly impose a section 1374 tax on income reported under
the installment method after the recognition period. In addition, they contend that the proposed regulations wrongly
apply the taxable income limitation by reference to the S corporation's cumulative taxable income from the year of
the installment sale to the year that income is reported under the installment method (assuming the income had been
reported in the year of the sale) instead of the S corporation's taxable income in the year that income was reported
under the installment method. Further, they believe that, where income is reported under the installment method
after the recognition period, the proposed regulations are unclear regarding the proper use of section 1374 attributes
and loss recognized after the recognition period that would have been recognized built-in loss if it had been recognized
during the recognition period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations retain the installment method rules in the proposed regulations because the Treasury and the
IRS believe those rules are necessary to prevent an abuse of section 1374. The final regulations clarify the use of
an S corporation's section 1374 attributes and loss recognized after the recognition period where income is reported
under the installment method for a year after the recognition period. Section 1374 attributes may be used to the extent
their use is allowed under all applicable provisions of the Code. However, the S corporation's loss recognized in
a year after the recognition period may not be used to reduce the section 1374 tax.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Partnership Items
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations generally provide that an S corporation owning an interest in a partnership must treat its
distributive share of the partnership's items as recognized built-in gain or loss to the extent the S corporation's
distributive share would have been treated as recognized built-in gain or loss if the items originated in, and were
taken into account directly by, the S corporation (the look-through rules). The look-through rules generally apply
only to the extent the S corporation had built-in gain or built-in loss in its partnership interest at the beginning
of the recognition period. The proposed regulations contain a small interest exception from the look-through rules
for any taxable year where the S corporation's partnership interest has a value less than $100,000 and represents
less than a 10 percent interest in the partnership's capital and profits at all times during the year. The small interest
exception does not apply if the partnership was formed or availed of with a principal purpose to avoid the section 1374
tax. The proposed regulations provide that if an S corporation disposes of its partnership interest during the recognition
period, the amount treated as recognized built-in gain or loss on the disposition is adjusted to take into account
amounts treated as recognized built-in gain or loss under the look-through rules. The proposed regulations also
provide special rules for section 704(c) gain and loss, and where an S corporation disposes of distributed partnership
assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commentators argue that the look-through rules should apply only where an S corporation controls the partnership
or the primary use of the partnership by the S corporation is to avoid section 1374 because, except where the S corporation
is the controlling partner, the S corporation is not likely to have access to information and records necessary to
identify and value partnership section 1374 items. In addition, the commentators suggest modifying the small interest
exception to the look-through rules so that the small interest test is generally applied only on the first day of the
recognition period. The commentators believe that subsequent increases or decreases in the fair market value of
the partnership interest should be disregarded.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final regulations retain the look-through rules. Access to information and records necessary to identify and
value partnership section 1374 items is not dependent on whether the S corporation is a controlling partner. Moreover,
section 1374 should generally apply to an S corporation's partnership section 1374 items even where a principal purpose
for using the partnership was not to avoid the section 1374 tax. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations, however, modify the small interest exception to the look-through rules to accommodate the
commentators' request for a rule requiring a valuation of the partnership interest only on the first day of the recognition
period. Under the rule as modified, the small interest exception generally applies for a taxable year if the S corporation's
interest in the partnership represents less than 10 percent of the partnership's profits and capital at all times
during the taxable year and prior taxable years in the recognition period and has a value less than $100,000 as of the
beginning of the recognition period. However, if the S corporation contributes an asset to the partnership in the
recognition period and the S corporation held the asset as of the beginning of the recognition period, the fair market
value of the S corporation's partnership interest as of the beginning of the recognition period is determined as if
the asset was contributed to the partnership before the beginning of the recognition period (using the fair market
value of the asset as of the beginning of the recognition period).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Valuing Inventory
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations provide that the value of an S corporation's inventory on the first day of the recognition
period equals the amount that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the inventory in a purchase of all the S corporation's
assets on that day. Commentators argue that the rules for valuing inventory in the proposed regulations are unclear
and should be clarified to provide a non-liquidation, non-distress, bulk sale approach, which generally will result
in a value for the inventory less than retail value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations provide that the value of an S corporation's inventory on the first day of the recognition period
generally is determined by reference to a sale of the entire business of the S corporation to a buyer that expects to
continue to operate that business. The buyer and seller are presumed not to be under any compulsion to buy or sell and
to have reasonable knowledge of all relevant facts. Relevant facts include (1) the replacement cost of the inventory;
(2) the expected retail selling price of the inventory; (3) the seller's incentive to demand a price for the inventory
that would compensate for and provide a fair return for expenditures the seller incurred to obtain, prepare, carry,
and dispose of the inventory before the sale of the business; and (4) the buyer's incentive to pay a price for the inventory
that would compensate for and provide a fair return for similar expenditures the buyer expects to incur after the sale
of the business. It is expected that the value of an S corporation's inventory as determined under the final regulations
will generally be less than its anticipated retail price, but greater than its replacement cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preamble to the proposed regulations describes a safe harbor rule that was being considered for publication as
a revenue procedure under which the value of inventory for purposes of section 1374 would be determined using a formula.
One commentator endorsed the general idea of adopting a safe harbor rule, but objected to the rule described in the
preamble and did not suggest an alternative rule. No commentators supported the rule described in the preamble of
the proposed regulations or suggested an alternative rule.

H. Section 1374(d)(8) Transactions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1374(d)(8) imposes a section 1374 tax if an S corporation acquires assets in a transaction where the S corporation's
basis in the assets is determined by reference to their basis in the hands of a C corporation (a section 1374(d)(8) transaction)
and, thereafter, the S corporation disposes of the assets. The proposed regulations provide that a separate determination
of tax under section 1374 must be made for the assets acquired in each section 1374(d)(8) transaction. Thus, an S corporation's
section 1374 attributes held on the day it became an S corporation may only be used to reduce a section 1374 tax imposed
on dispositions of assets the S corporation held on that day. Similarly, section 1374 attributes acquired by an S corporation
in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction may only be used to reduce a section 1374 tax imposed on dispositions of assets
the S corporation acquired in the same transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commentators argue that restrictions on the use of section 1374 attributes acquired by an S corporation in a section
1374(d)(8) transaction should not be greater than the restrictions that would apply if the attributes were acquired
by a C corporation in a similar transaction. For example, commentators contend that an S corporation's net operating
loss carryforwards when it changed from C to S status should be allowed to reduce a section 1374 tax imposed on assets
the S corporation acquires in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction, subject to all statutory limits on their use including
the anti-trafficking rules of sections 382, 383, and 384. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations retain the rules in the proposed regulations. Section 1374(d)(8) imposes a section 1374 tax
on the ``net recognized built-in gain attributable to'' the assets acquired in a particular transaction. The legislative
history under section 1374 states that ``each acquisition of assets from a C corporation is subject to a separate determination
of the amount of net built-in gain *&blank;*&blank;*.'' H.R. Rep. No. 795, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 63 (1988).

I. Effective Date and Additional Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations provide that the section 1374 final regulations will generally apply for taxable years
ending on or after the date the final regulations are published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, but only where the return is filed pursuant to an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after
that date. The final regulations retain the effective date in the proposed regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide that if a taxpayer subject to section 1374, but not generally subject to the regulations,
contributes an asset to a partnership under section 721(a) in contemplation of making an S election or during the recognition
period, section 1374 applies on a disposition of the asset by the partnership as if the S corporation still owned the
asset. This provision applies as of the effective date of section 1374. Commentators argue that the rule should apply
only for contributions to partnerships after the proposed regulations were issued. The final regulations retain
the rule in the proposed regulations to prevent an abuse of section 1374. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide that the rules in Announcement 86&hyph;128, 1986&hyph;51 I.R.B. 22, and Notice
90&hyph;27, 1990&hyph;1 C.B. 336, apply to taxpayers subject to section 1374, but not generally subject to the regulations.
Instead of referring to the rules in the Notice and the Announcement, the final regulations set forth some of the rules
contained in those documents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commentators suggest that the regulations allow taxpayers subject to section 1374, but not generally subject to
the regulations, to elect to be subject to the regulations. The final regulations do not adopt this suggestion because
of the burden of administering elections and because taxpayers not generally subject to the regulations nonetheless
may take positions consistent with the regulations.

It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations.
Therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking for these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration
for comment on its impact on small business.

Computation of tax.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The tax imposed on the income of an S corporation by section 1374(a) for any taxable year during the recognition period
is computed as follows_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Step One: Determine the net recognized built-in gain of the corporation for the taxable year under section 1374(d)(2)
and &sect;1.1374&hyph;2; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Step Two: Reduce the net recognized built-in gain (but not below zero) by any net operating loss and capital loss
carryforward allowed under section 1374(b)(2) and &sect;1.1374&hyph;5;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Step Three: Compute a tentative tax by applying the rate of tax determined under section 1374(b)(1) for the taxable
year to the amount determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Step Four: Compute the final tax by reducing the tentative tax (but not below zero) by any credit allowed under section
1374(b)(3) and &sect;1.1374&hyph;6.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Anti-trafficking rules.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If section 382, 383, or 384 would have applied to limit the use of a corporation's recognized built-in loss or section
1374 attributes at the beginning of the first day of the recognition period if the corporation had remained a C corporation,
these sections apply to limit their use in determining the S corporation's pre-limitation amount, taxable income
limitation, net unrealized built-in gain limitation, deductions against net recognized built-in gain, and credits
against the section 1374 tax. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1374 attributes.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 1374 attributes are the loss carryforwards allowed under section 1374(b)(2) as a deduction against net recognized
built-in gain and the credit and credit carryforwards allowed under section 1374(b)(3) as a credit against the section
1374 tax. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 Recognition period.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The recognition period is the 10-year (120-month) period beginning on the first day the corporation is an S corporation
or the day an S corporation acquires assets in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction. For example, if the first day of the
recognition period is July 14, 1996, the last day of the recognition period is July 13, 2006. If the recognition period
for certain assets ends during an S corporation's taxable year (for example, because the corporation was on a fiscal
year as a C corporation and changed to a calendar year as an S corporation or because an S corporation acquired assets
in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction during a taxable year), the S corporation must determine its pre-limitation
amount (as defined in &sect;1.1374&hyph;2(a)(1)) for the year as if the corporation's books were closed at the end
of the recognition period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Predecessor corporation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of section 1374(c)(1), if the basis of an asset of the S corporation is determined (in whole or in part)
by reference to the basis of the asset (or any other property) in the hands of another corporation, the other corporation
is a predecessor corporation of the S corporation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year is the least of_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Its taxable income determined by using all rules applying to C corporations and considering only its recognized
built-in gain, recognized built-in loss, and recognized built-in gain carryover (pre-limitation amount); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Its taxable income determined by using all rules applying to C corporations as modified by section 1375(b)(1)(B)
(taxable income limitation); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The amount by which its net unrealized built-in gain exceeds its net recognized built-in gain for all prior taxable
years (net unrealized built-in gain limitation).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Allocation rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an S corporation's pre-limitation amount for any taxable year exceeds its net recognized built-in gain for that
year, the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain consists of a ratable portion of each item of income, gain,
loss, and deduction included in the pre-limitation amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Recognized built-in gain carryover. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If an S corporation's net recognized built-in gain for any taxable year is equal to its taxable income limitation,
the amount by which its pre-limitation amount exceeds its taxable income limitation is a recognized built-in gain
carryover included in its pre-limitation amount for the succeeding taxable year. The recognized built-in gain carryover
consists of that portion of each item of income, gain, loss, and deduction not included in the S corporation's net recognized
built-in gain for the year the carryover arose, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accounting methods. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining its taxable income for pre-limitation amount and taxable income limitation purposes, a corporation
must use the accounting method(s) it uses for tax purposes as an S corporation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Example. Net recognized built-in gain. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
X is a calendar year C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. X has a net unrealized built-in
gain of $50,000 and no net operating loss or capital loss carryforwards. In 1996, X has a pre-limitation amount of $20,000,
consisting of ordinary income of $15,000 and capital gain of $5,000, a taxable income limitation of $9,600, and a net
unrealized built-in gain limitation of $50,000. Therefore, X's net recognized built-in gain for 1996 is $9,600,

X is a C corporation that purchased a working interest in an oil and gas property for $100,000 on July 1, 1993. X elects
to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, the working interest has a fair market value of $250,000
and an adjusted basis of $50,000, but no oil has as yet been extracted. In 1996, X begins production of the working interest,
sells oil that it has produced to a refinery for $75,000, and includes that amount in gross income. Under paragraph
(a)(1) of this section, the $75,000 is not recognized built-in gain because as of the beginning of the recognition
period X held only a working interest in the oil and gas property (since the oil had not yet been extracted from the ground),
and not the oil itself.

Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. Y has two shareholders, A and B.
A and B each own 50 percent of Y's stock. In addition, Y owns a royalty interest in an oil and gas property with a fair market
value of $300,000 and an adjusted basis of $200,000. Under section 613A(c)(11)(B), Y's $200,000 adjusted basis in
the royalty interest is allocated $100,000 to A and $100,000 to B. During 1996, A and B take depletion deductions with
respect to the royalty interest of $10,000 and $15,000, respectively. As of January 1, 1997, A and B have a basis in the
royalty interest of $90,000 and $85,000, respectively. On January 1, 1997, Y sells the royalty interest for $250,000.
Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, Y has gain recognized and recognized built-in gain of $75,000 ($250,000^($90,000+$85,000)=$75,000)
on the sale.

X is a C corporation using the cash method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On January
1, 1996, X has $50,000 of accounts receivable for services rendered before that date. On that date, the accounts receivable
have a fair market value of $40,000 and an adjusted basis of $0. In 1996, X collects $50,000 on the accounts receivable
and includes that amount in gross income. Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $50,000 included in gross income
in 1996 is recognized built-in gain because it would have been included in gross income before the beginning of the
recognition period if X had been an accrual method taxpayer. However, if X instead disposes of the accounts receivable
for $45,000 on July 1, 1996, in a transaction treated as a sale or exchange for federal income tax purposes, X would have

a lawsuit was filed against Y claiming $1,000,000 in damages. In 1996, Y loses the lawsuit, pays a $500,000 judgment,
and properly claims a deduction for that amount. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $500,000 deduction allowed
in 1996 is not recognized built-in loss because it would not have been allowed as a deduction against gross income before
the beginning of the recognition period if Y had been an accrual method taxpayer (even disregarding section 461(h)(2)(C)

until X makes payment. In 1996, X makes payment and properly claims a deduction for the amount of the payment. Under
paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the $150,000 deduction allowed in 1996 is recognized built-in loss because it would
have been allowed as a deduction against gross income before the beginning of the recognition period if X had been an
accrual method taxpayer (disregarding section 461(h)(2)(C) and &sect;1.461&hyph;4(g)).

X is a C corporation using an accrual method that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. In 1995,
X received $5,000 for services to be rendered in 1996, and properly included the $5,000 in gross income. In 1996, X properly

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
b
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
) of this chapter). As a result of the change in method of accounting, X has a $5,000 negative section 481(a) adjustment.
Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the $5,000 included in gross income in 1996 is recognized built-in gain because
it would have been included in gross income before the beginning of the recognition period by an accrual method taxpayer
using the method that X actually used before the beginning of the recognition period. In addition, the $5,000 negative
section 481(a) adjustment is recognized built-in loss because it relates to an item (the $5,000 X received for services
in 1995) attributable to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the principles for determining
recognized built-in gain or loss in this section. See paragraph (d) of this section for rules regarding section 481(a)

X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On December 31, 1995, A is age 60,
has provided services to X as an employee for 20 years, and is a vested participant in X's unfunded nonqualified retirement
plan. Under the plan, A receives $1,000 per month upon retirement until death. The plan provides no additional benefits.
A retires on December 31, 1997, after working for X for 22 years. A at no time is a shareholder of X. X's deductions under
section 404(a)(5) in the recognition period on paying A the $1,000 per month are recognized built-in loss because

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. X improperly capitalizes repair
costs and recovers the costs through depreciation of the related assets. In 1999, X properly changes to deducting
repair costs as they are incurred. Under section 481(a), the basis of the related assets are reduced by an amount equal
to the excess of the repair costs incurred before the year of change over the repair costs recovered through depreciation
before the year of change. In addition, X has a negative section 481(a) adjustment equal to the basis reduction. Under
paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the portion of X's negative section 481(a) adjustment relating to the repair costs
incurred before the recognition period is recognized built-in loss because those repair costs are items attributable
to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the principles for determining recognized built-in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. Y improperly uses an accrual method
without regard to the economic performance rules of section 461(h) to account for worker's compensation claims.
As a result, Y takes deductions when claims are filed. In 1999, Y properly changes to an accrual method with regard to
the economic performance rules under section 461(h)(2)(C) for worker's compensation claims. As a result, Y takes
deductions when claims are paid. The positive section 481(a) adjustment resulting from the change is equal to the
amount of claims filed, but unpaid, before the year of change. Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the deduction
allowed in the recognition period for claims filed, but unpaid, before the recognition period is recognized built-in
loss because a deduction was allowed for those claims before the recognition period under an accrual method without
regard to section 461(h)(2)(C). Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the portion of Y's positive section 481(a)
adjustment relating to claims filed, but unpaid, before the recognition period is recognized built-in gain because
those claims are items attributable to periods before the beginning of the recognition period under the principles
for determining recognized built-in gain or loss in this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the taxable income limitation under &sect;1.1374&hyph;2(a)(2)
is equal to the amount by which the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain would have been increased from the
year of the sale to the earlier of the year the income is reported under the installment method or the last year of the
recognition period, assuming all income from the sale had been reported in the year of the sale and all provisions of
section 1374 applied. For purposes of the preceding sentence, if the corporation sells the asset before the recognition
period, the income from the sale that is not reported before the recognition period is treated as having been reported
in the first year of the recognition period.

If the limitation in paragraph (h)(2) of this section applies, the excess of the amount reported under the installment
method over the amount subject to tax under the limitation is treated as if it were reported in the succeeding taxable
year(s), but only for succeeding taxable year(s) in the recognition period. The amount reported in the succeeding
taxable year(s) under the preceding sentence is reduced to the extent that the amount not subject to tax under the limitation
in paragraph (h)(2) of this section was not subject to tax because the S corporation had an excess of recognized built-in
loss over recognized built-in gain in the taxable year of the sale and succeeding taxable year(s) in the recognition
period.

X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. On that date, X sells Blackacre
with a basis of $0 and a value of $100,000 in exchange for a $100,000 note bearing a market rate of interest payable on
January 1, 2001. X does not make the election under section 453(d) and, therefore, reports the $100,000 gain using
the installment method under section 453. In the year 2001, X has income of $100,000 on collecting the note, unexpired
C year attributes of $0, recognized built-in loss of $0, current losses of $100,000, and taxable income of $0. If X had
reported the $100,000 gain in 1996, X's net recognized built-in gain from 1996 through 2001 would have been $75,000
greater than otherwise. Under paragraph (h) of this section, X has $75,000 net recognized built-in gain subject to
tax under section 1374. X also must treat the $25,000 excess of the amount reported, $100,000, over the amount subject
to tax, $75,000, as income reported under the installment method in the succeeding taxable year(s) in the recognition
period, except to the extent X establishes that the $25,000 was not subject to tax under section 1374 in the year 2001
because X had an excess of recognized built-in loss over recognized built-in gain in the taxable year of the sale and
succeeding taxable year(s) in the recognition period.

$0 that would have been recognized built-in loss if it had been recognized in the recognition period, current losses
of $0, taxable income of $500,000, and a minimum tax credit of $60,000 arising in 1995. None of Z's minimum tax credit

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Step One: Apply the rules of section 1374(d) to the S corporation's distributive share of partnership items of
income, gain, loss, or deduction included in income or allowed as a deduction under the rules of subchapter K to determine
the extent to which it would have been treated as recognized built-in gain or loss if the partnership items had originated
in and been taken into account directly by the S corporation (partnership 1374 items);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Step Two: Determine the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain without partnership 1374 items;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Step Three: Determine the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain with partnership 1374 items; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Step Four: If the amount computed under Step Three (paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section) exceeds the amount
computed under Step Two (paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section), the excess (as limited by paragraph (i)(2)(i) of
this section) is the S corporation's partnership RBIG, and the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain is the
sum of the amount computed under Step Two (paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section) plus the partnership RBIG. If the
amount computed under Step Two (paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section) exceeds the amount computed under Step Three
(paragraph (i)(1)(iii) of this section), the excess (as limited by paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section) is the S
corporation's partnership RBIL, and the S corporation's net recognized built-in gain is the remainder of the amount
computed under Step Two (paragraph (i)(1)(ii) of this section) after subtracting the partnership RBIL.

 Paragraph (i)(1) of this section does not apply to a taxable year in the recognition period if the S corporation's partnership
interest represents less than 10 percent of the partnership's capital and profits at all times during the taxable
year and prior taxable years in the recognition period, and the fair market value of the S corporation's partnership
interest as of the beginning of the recognition period is less than $100,000.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For purposes of paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section, if the S corporation contributes any assets to the partnership
during the recognition period and the S corporation held the assets as of the beginning of the recognition period,
the fair market value of the S corporation's partnership interest as of the beginning of the recognition period is
determined as if the assets were contributed to the partnership before the beginning of the recognition period (using
the fair market value of each contributed asset as of the beginning of the recognition period). The contribution does
not affect whether paragraph (i)(5)(i) of this section applies for taxable years in the recognition period before
the taxable year in which the contribution was made.

 Solely for purposes of section 1374, an S corporation's section 704(c) gain or loss amount with respect to any asset

 If on the first day of the recognition period an S corporation holds an interest in a partnership that holds an asset
and during the recognition period the partnership distributes the asset to the S corporation that thereafter disposes
of the asset, the asset is treated as having been held by the S corporation on the first day of the recognition period
and as having the fair market value and adjusted basis in the hands of the S corporation that it had in the hands of the
partnership on that day.

Example 1. Pre-conversion partnership interest.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a 50 percent interest
in partnership P and P owns (among other assets) Blackacre with a basis of $25,000 and a value of $45,000. In 1996, P buys
Whiteacre for $50,000. In 1999, P sells Blackacre for $55,000 and recognizes a gain of $30,000 of which $15,000 is included
in X's distributive share. P also sells Whiteacre in 1999 for $42,000 and recognizes a loss of $8,000 of which $4,000
is included in X's distributive share. Under this paragraph and section 1374(d)(3), X's $15,000 gain is presumed
to be recognized built-in gain and thus treated as a partnership 1374 item, but this presumption is rebutted if X establishes
that P's gain would have been only $20,000 ($45,000^$25,000=$20,000) if Blackacre had been sold on the first day of
the recognition period. In such a case, only X's distributive share of the $20,000 built-in gain, $10,000, would be
treated as a partnership 1374 item. Under this paragraph and section 1374(d)(4), X's $4,000 loss is not treated as
a partnership 1374 item because P did not hold Whiteacre on the first day of the recognition period.

Example 2. Post-conversion contribution.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, Y owns (among other assets)
Blackacre with a basis of $100,000 and a value of $200,000. On January 1, 1998, when Blackacre has a basis of $100,000
and a value of $200,000, Y contributes Blackacre to partnership P for a 50 percent interest in P. On January 1, 2000,
P sells Blackacre for $300,000 and recognizes a gain of $200,000 on the sale ($300,000^$100,000=$200,000). P is allocated
$100,000 of the gain under section 704(c), and another $50,000 of the gain for its fifty percent share of the remainder,
for a total of $150,000. Under this paragraph and section 1374(d)(3), if Y establishes that P's gain would have been
only $100,000 ($200,000^$100,000=$100,000) if Blackacre had been sold on the first day of the recognition period,
Y would treat only $100,000 as a partnership 1374 item.

Example 3. RBIG limitation of $100,000 or $50,000.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a 50 percent interest
in partnership P with a RBIG limitation of $100,000 and a RBIL limitation of $0. P owns (among other assets) Blackacre
with a basis of $50,000 and a value of $200,000. In 1996, P sells Blackacre for $200,000 and recognizes a gain of $150,000
of which $75,000 is included in X's distributive share and treated as a partnership 1374 item. X's net recognized built-in
gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $35,000 and with partnership 1374 items is $110,000. Thus,
X has a partnership RBIG of $75,000 except as limited under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section. Because X's RBIG limitation
is $100,000, X's partnership RBIG of $75,000 is not limited and X's net recognized built-in gain for the year is $110,000
($35,000+$75,000=$110,000). However, if X had a RBIG limitation of $50,000 instead of $100,000, X's partnership
RBIG would be limited to $50,000 under paragraph (i)(2)(i) of this section and X's net recognized built-in gain would
be $85,000 ($35,000+$50,000=$85,000).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, Y owns a 50 percent interest
in partnership P with a RBIG limitation of $0 and a RBIL limitation of $60,000. P owns (among other assets) Blackacre
with a basis of $225,000 and a value of $125,000. In 1996, P sells Blackacre for $125,000 and recognizes a loss of $100,000
of which $50,000 is included in Y's distributive share and treated as a partnership 1374 item. Y's net recognized built-in
gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $75,000 and with partnership 1374 items is $25,000. Thus,
Y has a partnership RBIL of $50,000 for the year except as limited under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section. Because
Y's RBIL limitation is $60,000, Y's partnership RBIL for the year is not limited and Y's net recognized built-in gain
for the year is $25,000 ($75,000^$50,000=$25,000). However, if Y had a RBIL limitation of $40,000 instead of $60,000,
Y's partnership RBIL would be limited to $40,000 under paragraph (i)(2)(ii) of this section and Y's net recognized
built-in gain for the year would be $35,000 ($75,000^$40,000=$35,000).

X is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, X owns a 50 percent interest

with a basis of $20,000 and a value of $140,000. In 1996, P sells Blackacre for $140,000 and recognizes a gain of $120,000
of which $60,000 is included in X's distributive share and treated as a partnership 1374 item. X's net recognized built-in
gain for 1996 computed without partnership 1374 items is $95,000 and with partnership 1374 items is $155,000. Thus,
X has a partnership RBIG of $60,000. In 1999, X sells its entire interest in P for $350,000 and recognizes a gain of $250,000.
Under paragraph (i)(3) of this section, X's recognized built-in gain on the sale is limited by its RBIG limitation

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation on January 1, 1996. On that date, Y contributes Asset 1, 5-year
property with a value of $40,000 and a basis of $0, and an unrelated party contributes $40,000 in cash, each for a 50 percent
interest in partnership P. The partnership adopts the traditional method under &sect;1.704&hyph;3(b). If P sold
Asset 1 for $40,000 immediately after it was contributed by Y, P's $40,000 gain would be allocated to Y under section
704(c). Instead, Asset 1 is sold by P in 1999 for $36,000 and P recognizes gain of $36,000 ($36,000^$0=$36,000) on the
sale. However, because book depreciation of $8,000 per year has been taken on Asset 1 in 1996, 1997, and 1998, Y is allocated
only $16,000 of P's $36,000 gain ($40,000^(3&times;$8,000)=($16,000^$0)=$16,000) under section 704(c). The
remaining $20,000 of P's $36,000 gain ($36,000^$16,000=$20,000) is allocated 50 percent to each partner under section
704(b). Thus, a total of $26,000 ($16,000+$10,000=$26,000) of P's $36,000 gain is allocated to Y. However, under
paragraph (i)(6) of this section, Y treats $36,000 as a partnership 1374 item on P's sale of Asset 1.

and without regard to any alternative minimum tax foreign tax credit described in that section and by treating the
net recognized built-in gain determined under &sect;1.1374&hyph;2, modified to take into account the adjustments
of sections 56 and 58 applicable to corporations and the preferences of section 57, as the alternative minimum taxable

percent tax rate]. Thus, the business credit limitation under section 38(c) is $59,750 [$106,750^$47,000 (the greater
of $47,000 or $20,438 (.25 x $81,750 ($106,750^$25,000=$81,750))) = $59,750]. As a result, X's section 1374 tax is
$47,000 ($106,750^$59,750= $47,000) for 1996 and X has $440,250 ($500,000^$59,750 = $440,250) of business credit
carryforwards for succeeding taxable years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1 has a fair market value of $5,000,000, a basis for regular tax purposes of $4,000,000, and a basis for alternative
minimum tax purposes of $4,750,000. Y also has a minimum tax credit of $310,000 from 1995. Y has no other assets, no net
operating or capital loss carryforwards, and no business credit carryforwards. In 1996, Y's only transaction is
the sale of Asset #1 for $5,000,000. Therefore, Y has net recognized built-in gain in 1996 of $1,000,000 ($5,000,000^$4,000,000=$1,000,000)
and a tentative tax under paragraph (a)(3) of &sect;1.1374&hyph;1 of $350,000 ($1,000,000&times;.35=$350,000,
assuming a 35 percent tax rate). Also, Y's tentative minimum tax determined under paragraph (b) of this section is
$47,000 [$5,000,000^$4,750,000=$250,000^$15,000 ($40,000 corporate exemption amount ^$25,000 phase-out =
$15,000) = $235,000&times;.20 = $47,000, assuming a 20 percent tax rate]. Thus, Y may use its minimum tax credit in
the amount of $303,000 ($350,000^$47,000=$303,000) to offset its section 1374 tentative tax. As a result, Y's section
1374 tax is $47,000 ($350,000^$303,000=$47,000) in 1996 and Y has a minimum tax credit attributable to years for which
Y was a C corporation of $7,000 ($310,000^$303,000=$7,000).

The fair market value of the inventory of an S corporation on the first day of the recognition period equals the amount
that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the inventory in a purchase of all the S corporation's assets by a
buyer that expects to continue to operate the S corporation's business. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the
buyer and seller are presumed not to be under any compulsion to buy or sell and to have reasonable knowledge of all relevant
facts.

Identity of dispositions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The inventory method used by an S corporation for tax purposes must be used to identify whether the inventory it disposes
of during the recognition period is inventory it held on the first day of that period. Thus, a corporation using the
LIFO method does not dispose of inventory it held on the first day of the recognition period unless the carrying value
of its inventory for a taxable year during that period is less than the carrying value of its inventory on the first day
of the recognition period (determined using the LIFO method as described in section 472). However, if a corporation
changes its method of accounting for inventory (for example, from the FIFO method to the LIFO method or from the LIFO
method to the FIFO method) with a principal purpose of avoiding the tax imposed under section 1374, it must use its former
method to identify its dispositions of inventory.

If any S corporation acquires any asset in a transaction in which the S corporation's basis in the asset is determined
(in whole or in part) by reference to a C corporation's basis in the assets (or any other property) (a section 1374(d)(8)
transaction), section 1374 applies to the net recognized built-in gain attributable to the assets acquired in any
section 1374(d)(8) transaction.

Separate determination of tax. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of the tax imposed under section 1374(d)(8), a separate determination of tax is made with respect to the
assets the S corporation acquires in one section 1374(d)(8) transaction from the assets the S corporation acquires
in another section 1374(d)(8) transaction and from the assets the corporation held when it became an S corporation.
Thus, an S corporation's section 1374 attributes when it became an S corporation may only be used to reduce the section
1374 tax imposed on dispositions of assets the S corporation held at that time. Similarly, an S corporation's section
1374 attributes acquired in a section 1374(d)(8) transaction may only be used to reduce a section 1374 tax imposed
on dispositions of assets the S corporation acquired in the same transaction.

built-in gain for that year (determined without regard to the taxable income limitation) based on the ratio of each
of those determinations to the sum of all of those determinations.

(i) X is a C corporation that elected to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1986 (before section 1374 was amended
in the Tax Reform Act of 1986). X has a net operating loss carryforward of $20,000 arising in 1985 when X was a C corporation.
On January 1, 1996, Y (an unrelated C corporation) merges into X in a transaction to which section 368(a)(1)(A) applies.
Y has no loss carryforwards, credits, or credit carryforwards. The assets X acquired from Y are subject to tax under
section 1374 and have a net unrealized built-in gain of $150,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In 1996, X has a pre-limitation amount of $50,000 on dispositions of assets acquired from Y and a taxable income
limitation of $100,000 (because only one group of assets is subject to section 1374, there is no allocation of the taxable
income limitation). As a result, X has a net recognized built-in gain on those assets of $50,000. X's $20,000 net operating
loss carryforward may not be used as a deduction against its $50,000 net recognized built-in gain on the assets X acquired
from Y. Therefore, X has a section 1374 tax of $17,500 ($50,000 &times; .35 = $17,500, assuming a 35 percent tax rate)
for its 1996 taxable year.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) Y is a C corporation that elects to become an S corporation effective January 1, 1996. The assets Y holds when it becomes
an S corporation have a net unrealized built-in gain of $5,000. Y has no loss carryforwards, credits, or credit carryforwards.
On January 1, 1997, Z (an unrelated C corporation) merges into Y in a transaction to which section 368(a)(1)(A) applies.
Z has no loss carryforwards, credits, or credit carryforwards. The assets Y acquired from Z are subject to tax under
section 1374 and have a net unrealized built-in gain of $80,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) In 1997, Y has a pre-limitation amount on the assets it held when it became an S corporation of $15,000, a pre-limitation
amount on the assets Y acquired from Z of $15,000, and a taxable income limitation of $10,000. However, because the
assets Y held on becoming an S corporation have a net unrealized built-in gain of $5,000, its net recognized built-in
gain on those assets is limited to $5,000 before taking into account the taxable income limitation. Y's taxable income
limitation of $10,000 is allocated between the assets Y held on becoming an S corporation and the assets Y acquired
from Z for purposes of determining the net recognized built-in gain from each pool of assets. Thus, Y's net recognized
built-in gain on the assets Y held on becoming an S corporation is $2,500 [$10,000 &times; ($5,000/$20,000) = $2,500].
Y's net recognized built-in gain on the assets Y acquired from Z is $7,500 [$10,000 &times; ($15,000/$20,000) = $7,500].
Therefore, Y has a section 1374 tax of $3,500 [($2,500 + $7,500) &times; .35 = $3,500, assuming a 35 percent tax rate]
for its 1997 taxable year.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a corporation transfers an asset to a partnership in a transaction to which section 721(a) applies and the transfer
is made in contemplation of an S election or during the recognition period, section 1374 applies on a disposition of
the asset by the partnership as if the S corporation had disposed of the asset itself. This paragraph (b)(1) applies
as of the effective date of section 1374, unless the recognition period with respect to the contributed asset is pursuant
to an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after December 27, 1994.

Certain inventory dispositions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of section 1374(d)(2)(A), the inventory method used by the taxpayer for tax purposes (FIFO, LIFO, etc.)
must be used to identify whether goods disposed of following conversion to S corporation status were held by the corporation
at the time of conversion. Thus, for example, a corporation using the LIFO inventory method will not be subject to the
built-in gain tax with respect to sales of inventory except to the extent that a LIFO layer existing prior to the beginning
of the first taxable year as an S corporation is invaded after the beginning of that year. This paragraph (b)(2) applies
as of the effective date of section 1374, unless the recognition period with respect to the inventory is pursuant to
an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after December 27, 1994.

If a built-in loss asset (that is, an asset with an adjusted tax basis in excess of its fair market value) is contributed
to a corporation within 2 years before the earlier of the beginning of its first taxable year as an S corporation, or
the filing of its S election, the loss inherent in the asset will not reduce net unrealized built-in gain, as defined
in section 1374(d)(1), unless the taxpayer demonstrates a clear and substantial relationship between the contributed
property and the conduct of the corporation's current or future business enterprises. This paragraph (b)(3) applies
as of the effective date of section 1374, unless the recognition period with respect to the contributed asset is pursuant
to an S election or a section 1374(d)(8) transaction occurring on or after December 27, 1994.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a taxpayer sells an asset either prior to or during the recognition period and recognizes income either during or
after the recognition period from the sale under the installment method, the income will, when recognized, be taxed
under section 1374 to the extent it would have been so taxed in prior taxable years if the selling corporation had made
the election under section 453(d) not to report the income under the installment method. For purposes of determining
the extent to which the income would have been subject to tax if the section 453(d) election had not been made, the taxable
income limitation of section 1374(d)(2)(A)(ii) and the built-in gain carryover rule of section 1374(d)(2)(B) will
be taken into account. This paragraph (b)(4) applies for installment sales occurring on or after March 26, 1990, and

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In year 1 of the recognition period under section 1374, a corporation realizes a gain of $100,000 on the sale of an asset
with built-in gain. The corporation is to receive full payment for the asset in year 11. Because the corporation does
not make an election under section 453(d), all $100,000 of the gain from the sale is reported under the installment
method in year 11. If the corporation had made an election under section 453(d) with respect to the sale, the gain would
have been recognized in year 1 and, taking into account the corporation's income and gains from other sources, application
of the taxable income limitation of section 1374(d)(2)(A)(ii) and the built-in gain carryover rule of section 1374(d)(2)(B)
would have resulted in $40,000 of the gain being subject to tax during the recognition period under section 1374. Therefore,
$40,000 of the gain recognized in year 11 is subject to tax under section 1374.

Example 2.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In year 1 of the recognition period under section 1374, a corporation realizes a gain of $100,000 on the sale of an asset
with built-in gain. The corporation is to receive full payment for the asset in year 6. Because the corporation does
not make an election under section 453(d), all $100,000 of the gain from the sale is reported under the installment
method in year 6. If the corporation had made an election under section 453(d) with respect to the sale, the gain would
have been recognized in year 1 and, taking into account the corporation's income and gains from other sources, application
of the taxable income limitation of section 1374(d)(2)(A)(ii) and the built-in gain carryover rule of section 1374(d)(2)(B)
would have resulted in all of the gain being subjected to tax under section 1374 in years 1 through 5. Therefore, notwithstanding
that the taxable income limitation of section 1374(d)(2)(A)(ii) might otherwise limit the taxation of the gain recognized
in year 6, the entire $100,000 of gain will be subject to tax under section 1374 when it is recognized in year 6.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains final regulations relating to certain Federal income tax consequences of a disposition of
an interest in a nuclear power plant by a taxpayer that has maintained a nuclear decommissioning fund with respect
to that plant. These regulations affect taxpayers that transfer or acquire interests in nuclear power plants by providing
guidance on the tax consequences of these transfers. In addition, the final regulations extend the benefits of section
468A to electing taxpayers with an interest in a nuclear power plant under the jurisdiction of the Rural Electrification
Administration. The regulations also make a number of other changes and clarifications to the existing regulations
to aid in the administration of section 468A.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR parts 1 and 602) under section 468A. Section
468A, relating to nuclear decommissioning costs, was added to the Internal Revenue Code by section 91(c) of the Tax
Reform Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98&hyph;369, 98 Stat. 604). On November 20, 1992, the IRS published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of proposed rulemaking (57 FR 54734) setting forth proposed amendments to the regulations under section
468A. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 468A(c)(1)(B) authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations that prescribe the extent to which a taxpayer
must include amounts from a nuclear decommissioning fund (a Fund) in gross income upon the disposition of an interest
in a nuclear power plant to which the Fund relates. Section 1.468A&hyph;6T (TD 8094, 51 FR 25033) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 10, 1986, treated such a disposition as a taxable distribution of assets in the Fund to the taxpayer transferring
the interest. In response to generally adverse comments on this rule, final regulations (TD 8184, 53 FR 6800) published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 3, 1988, stated that guidance on the tax treatment of these dispositions would be provided at a later date.
These regulations are issued to provide this guidance.

Explanation of Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
In General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations prescribe certain federal income tax consequences of the disposition of all or a portion of a qualifying
interest in a nuclear power plant to which a Fund relates. The regulations treat a transfer of Fund assets in connection
with such a disposition as a nonrecognition event, provided certain requirements are satisfied. The transferee
of the interest is viewed as stepping into the shoes of the transferor with respect to the amount of the assets in the
transferor's Fund that is proportionate to the interest transferred and with respect to the transferor's ruling
amount for the portion of the taxable year that follows the disposition. These regulations also provide rules for
the calculation of schedules of ruling amounts for the transferee and for a transferor that retains a portion of its
original qualifying interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations also contain a general provision allowing the IRS to treat a disposition occurring on or after December
27, 1994 as satisfying the requirements of the regulations if the IRS decides that this treatment is necessary or appropriate
to carry out the purposes of section 468A and the regulations thereunder. Another provision allows the IRS, upon the
request of an electing taxpayer, to apply these regulations to a disposition of an interest in a nuclear power plant
occurring after July 17, 1984, and before December 27, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations also allow rural electric cooperatives to qualify as electing taxpayers; modify the information
requirements that are part of a request for a schedule of ruling amounts; create a new mandatory review period for schedules
of ruling amounts determined with respect to a disposition of an interest in a nuclear power plant; require that the
trust agreement for each Fund contain a provision that assets of the Fund may be used only in a manner that is authorized
by section 468A and the regulations thereunder; and provide that the period within which a taxpayer must substantially
comply with the provisions requiring information to be submitted as part of a request for a schedule of ruling amounts
is the general period applicable to requests for private letter rulings.

Comments Received
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments received in response to the notice of proposed rulemaking (57 FR 54734) can be divided into five general categories_rural
electric cooperatives, reduction in time to provide additional information, trust provisions, disposition provisions,
and self-dealing rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Rural Electric Cooperatives
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations extend the benefits of section 468A to electing rural electric cooperatives. One commentator
requested that the IRS (1) not consider earnings on assets in Funds when determining whether tax-exempt rural electric
cooperatives satisfy the 85 percent test of section 501(c)(12) (which requires at least 85 percent of the cooperative's
income to be from members); (2) specify the regulatory authority (Rural Electrification Administration, Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, or State Commission) that is charged with approving cost of service amounts; and (3)
allow rural electric cooperatives to elect to apply section 468A retroactively for all open taxable years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The determination of whether earnings on nuclear decommissioning funds (whether or not established under section
468A) count toward satisfaction of the 85 percent test is an issue under section 501 and, therefore, is outside the
scope of this project. Further, it is the responsibility of the regulatory authorities to decide which of the authorities
is responsible for approving cost of service amounts. These issues, therefore, are not addressed in the final regulations.
Additionally, because sections 468A (a) and (g) require that payments to a Fund for a taxable year be made no later than
two and one-half months after the close of that year, the IRS believes that retroactive application of section 468A
to rural electric cooperatives is not permitted by the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Time Period for Additional Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations also reduce the time for submitting additional information requested by the IRS concerning
a request for a schedule of ruling amounts from 60 to 30 days. Many commentators stated that the abbreviated response
time would be inadequate for a taxpayer to gather, prepare, and submit requested information. Retaining the requirements
of the proposed regulations, the final regulations merely conform the section 468A rules to the normal rules governing
requests for letter rulings to help expedite the rulings process. The final regulations clarify, however, that the
IRS may waive this deadline if the taxpayer is making a good faith effort to comply with the deadline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Trust Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations also provide that each qualified nuclear decommissioning trust agreement must require
that assets of the Fund be used as authorized by section 468A and the regulations thereunder and that the agreement
cannot be amended to violate section 468A or the regulations thereunder. Commentators argued that this provision
exceeds the IRS's authority. It is apparent from section 468A(e)(4) (which requires that amounts in a Fund be used
exclusively for decommissioning, associated expenses, or, when not currently needed for those purposes, to make
investments) and from the special section 468A tax rules (including the preferential tax rates on Fund earnings for
taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993), that Congress intended for amounts set aside in these Funds to be
available for decommissioning of nuclear power plants. The IRS believes it is consistent with this Congressional
intent, and with the IRS's responsibilities for successfully administering the program, to require that the trust
agreements limit use of Fund assets to section 468A purposes. Accordingly, the final regulations retain this requirement.
To ensure that taxpayers have sufficient time to modify their trust agreements, the final regulations also retain
the grace period of the proposed regulations that allows until December 31, 1996, for the inclusion of the required
trust provisions.

Dispositions of an Interest in a Nuclear Power Plant
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations generally treat transfers of assets in Funds resulting from transfers of interests in nuclear
power plants to which the Funds relate as nonrecognition, transferred basis transactions. Most of the comments favored
the proposed rules. However, commentators requested (1) additional guidance on how to determine which Fund assets
relate to a transferred interest in a nuclear power plant and clarification that the regulations were not adopting
a tracing approach; (2) an option to treat these dispositions as triggering a taxable transfer of related assets;
(3) an option to transfer an entire Fund rather than the assets in the Fund; and (4) assurance that the proposed rules
apply in the context of corporate reorganizations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, to make clear that the regulations do not adopt a tracing approach, the final regulations refer to assets in
a Fund that are proportionate to the interest in the plant that is transferred, rather than to assets that ``relate''
to the interest transferred. The final regulations also clarify that a proportionate amount of the assets in a Fund
is considered transferred if, on the date the qualifying interest is transferred, the percentage of the aggregate
fair market value of the assets transferred equals the percentage of the qualifying interest transferred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the final regulations do not adopt the suggestion to provide taxpayers with an option to treat the disposition
as triggering a taxable transfer of a proportionate amount of the assets. The nonrecognition, transferred basis
approach simplifies the tax rules for dispositions and corresponds to the substance of these transactions. Permitting
taxpayers to elect taxable treatment would unnecessarily complicate the tax rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, to minimize the role of form in these disposition transactions, the final regulations clarify that when an
interest in a nuclear power plant is transferred, the associated assets must be transferred to a Fund of the transferee
or, if the transferee acquires the transferor's entire interest in the plant, the transferor's Fund may be transferred
to the transferee. Such a transfer of the transferor's Fund must not be prohibited by the transferor's trust agreement
or applicable local law. Regardless of whether the assets of the transferor's Fund or the Fund itself is transferred,
after the transfer, the transferee must not violate &sect;1.468A&hyph;5(a)(1)(ii), which requires that an electing
taxpayer maintain only one Fund for each nuclear power plant. Similarly, after the transfer, the transferee and the
transferor that retains an interest must not violate &sect;1.468A&hyph;5(a)(1)(ii), which requires that each
electing taxpayer have a separate Fund for its interest in the same plant.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the final regulations provide that if a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferee acquires an interest in a nuclear power plant in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a transaction to which &sect;1.468A&hyph;6 (dispositions of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest in a nuclear power plant) applies, the transferee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifying percentage for the interest acquired generally is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the transferor's qualifying percentage with respect to that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest immediately before the disposition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fourth, although the final regulations make no specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mention of corporate reorganizations, they apply to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispositions described in the regulations, including those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that occur in the context of corporate reorganizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Self-Dealing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations also make a change to the rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibiting a trustee or other disqualified person from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
engaging in an act of self-dealing with a Fund. The change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excepts deposits in trustee institutions from the self- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dealing rules if the deposits are made to facilitate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temporary investments or the payment of reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative expenses. The change was intended to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative costs associated with establishing an account 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a different institution for these purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commentators criticized the rule on the ground that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
called into question the permissibility of using Fund assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pay investment advisory and trustee fees. In response to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these comments, the final regulations provide that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed exception to the self-dealing rules is an addition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to, rather than a substitution for, the existing exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for payment of fees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been determined that section 553(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, the notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small business.

Special rules for electing taxpayers whose rates are under the jurisdiction of the Rural Electrification Administration.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notwithstanding any other provision of the regulations under section 468A, a schedule of ruling amounts may be provided
to a taxpayer with respect to a nuclear power plant if the rates for the furnishing or sale of the plant's electricity
are under the jurisdiction of the Rural Electrification Administration. This schedule will be determined on the
basis of all facts and circumstances in a manner consistent with section 468A. No taxpayer will be provided a schedule
of ruling amounts under section 468A for any taxable year unless the portion of the rates attributable to the decommissioning
costs of that taxpayer with respect to such taxable year are treated by the taxpayer as though they were subject to section
88.

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Requirements
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. This section applies if_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Immediately before the disposition, the transferor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained a Fund with respect to the interest disposed of; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Immediately after the disposition_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The transferee maintains a Fund with respect to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest acquired; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The interest acquired is a qualifying interest of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the transferee in the nuclear power plant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Either a proportionate amount (which could include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all) of the assets of the transferor's Fund is transferred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a Fund of the transferee, or the transferor's entire Fund 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is transferred to the transferee, provided in the latter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case (or if the transferee receives all of the assets in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferor's Fund, but not the transferor's Fund) that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferee acquires the transferor's entire qualifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest in the plant; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The transferee continues to satisfy the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of &sect;1.468A&hyph;5(a)(iii), which permits an electing taxpayer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain only one Fund for each plant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by reason of the transfer of the transferor's entire Fund to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the transferee). For purposes of the regulations under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 468A, this transfer (or the transfer of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferor's Fund) will not be considered a distribution of

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by reason of the transfer of the transferor's Fund to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferee). For purposes of the regulations under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
468A, this transfer (or the transfer of the transferor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fund) will not constitute a payment or a contribution of

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Transfers of assets of a Fund to which this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section applies do not affect basis. Thus, the transferee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fund will have a basis in the assets received from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferor's Fund that is the same as the basis of those

For purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this section, a transferor of a qualifying interest in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear power plant is considered to transfer a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proportionate amount of the assets of its Fund to a Fund of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a transferee of the interest if, on the date of the transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the interest, the percentage of the fair market value of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Fund's assets that are transferred equals the percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the transferor's qualifying interest that is transferred.

requests special treatment, explains the need for such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment, and sets forth an alternative basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the qualifying percentage; and

on October 4, 1991 in Executive Order 12775. This termination does not affect compliance and enforcement actions
involving prior transactions or violations of the sanctions.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Haitian Transactions Regulations, 31 CFR Part 580
(the ``HTR''), to add 500.524, implementing Executive Order 12932, which authorizes all transactions on or after
October 16, 1994, involving property in which Haiti or its nationals have an interest, and all other transactions
previously prohibited by the HTR. The effect of this amendment is to authorize all transactions previously prohibited
by subpart B of the HTR or by Executive Order 12775, 12779, 12853, 12872, 12914, 12917, 12920 or 12922, effective October
16, 1994. On October 14, 1994, the President signed Executive Order 12932, terminating the national emergency declared
with respect the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 regime in Haiti and revoking all Executive orders promulgated with respect to that emergency, effective October
16, 1994. Newly authorized transactions include, but are not limited to, new investment, otherwise lawful importations
from and exportations to Haiti, and brokering transactions. Reports due under general or specific license must still
be filed covering activities up until the effective date of this rule. Enforcement actions with respect to past violations
of the sanctions are not affected by this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the HTR involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and
delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Coast Guard is adopting as final, with minor revisions, an interim rule allowing for greater delegation by the
District Commander and for a simplified alternative procedure for resolving civil penalty cases. This procedure
streamlines the process for resolution of certain uncontested oil discharge and pollution prevention civil penalty
cases by allowing a Coast Guard official to present a notice of violation (NOV) and proposed penalty to a party in the
field.

On April 7, 1994, the Coast Guard published an interim final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 16558) establishing an optional alternative civil penalty procedure and announced a six-month pilot implementation
program to test the new procedure. The Coast Guard received 5 letters during the comment period and 4 after the comment
period was closed. All comments were considered before drafting this final rule. No public hearing was requested,
and none was held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The procedures for assessing civil penalties by the Coast Guard are contained in 33 CFR 1.07. The civil penalty process
begins when an alleged violation is detected by, or reported to, a Coast Guard official. The alleged violation is investigated
and, if it appears that the elements for a violation case exist, civil enforcement action is normally initiated by
preparing a case report with a recommended penalty and forwarding it to the appropriate Coast Guard District office
for review. Since the establishment of the Notice of Violation (NOV) option, some cases are now eligible for issuance
of a NOV and parties are afforded the option of either paying the proposed penalty and closing the case, or having the
violation processed through normal procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the case is not eligible for NOV issuance or if the party declines the NOV, the District staff reviews the case report
to verify that there was evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case and that the recommended penalty is appropriate.
The case file is then transmitted, with a recommended action, to the Hearing Officer. Based on the case file, the Hearing
Officer independently determines whether prima facie evidence of a violation exists and, if so, sends a Letter of
Notification to the alleged violator. This letter specifies, among other matters, the alleged violation(s) and
a penalty amount deemed appropriate based on the information provided to the Hearing Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A party can pay the penalty amount specified by the Hearing Officer, request an in-person hearing, or provide written
evidence or arguments in lieu of a hearing. If the party pays the penalty, the case is closed and no further action is
required. If the party chooses either of the latter two options, the Hearing Officer either conducts an in-person
hearing or reviews the submitted written evidence and arguments. The Hearing Officer then issues a written decision
assessing a penalty or dismissing the case. The Hearing Officer's decision can be administratively appealed to the
Commandant of the Coast Guard.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Notice of Violation option was developed to address the Coast Guard's concern that the civil penalty assessment
process was too lengthy when applied to small (under 100 gallons) oil discharges and minor pollution prevention regulation
violations. The lengthy process time meant that a party frequently would have additional violations before being
notified by a Hearing Officer of the initiation of action for the first violation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NOV option provides for early notification of alleged violators and offers early resolution of uncontested small
oil spill and pollution prevention violations. Early resolution of these minor violations saves time and reduces
costs of internal reviews, improves deterrence, and facilitates corrective action by providing a party with earlier
notice of violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The interim rule amended 33 CFR 1.07 to add the optional alternative procedure and the Coast Guard conducted a pilot
program for six months in the Captain of the Port zones of Charleston, SC; Galveston, TX; and Los Angeles, CA. The result
of the pilot program was favorable. During the pilot program 197 NOVs were issued for oil spills and 21 NOVs were issued
for pollution prevention violations with a total penalty value of $96,400. As of October 13, 1994, 160 NOVs had been
paid totaling $57,275 in penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The optional procedure allows early settlement of cases in which a Coast Guard issuing officer issues a NOV. A Coast
Guard issuing officer is a commissioned, warrant or petty officer with specific training and authority to issue a
violation notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A party has the option of paying the penalty proposed on the NOV, declining the NOV, or taking no action on the NOV. If
a party pays the proposed penalty indicated on a NOV, the case is closed without further processing by a District Program
Manager or Hearing Officer. If a party declines the NOV or takes no action, the case is processed as if an NOV had never
been issued. A complete case file, report and recommended penalty amount is sent to the District Commander for review
prior to being forwarded to the Hearing Officer for processing as any other civil penalty case. The Hearing Officer's
Letter of Notification would specify a penalty deemed appropriate based on the case file. The proposed penalty is
not limited to the amount proposed in the field on the NOV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NOV option will be implemented by Coast Guard Captains of the Port as soon as sufficient numbers of personnel have
been trained in the issuance of NOVs. Representatives from each district, marine safety office, and detachment are
being sent to a ``train the trainer'' course on the NOV option at the Coast Guard Reserve Training Center in Yorktown,
VA. After the initial Yorktown training, each unit will be able to properly train additional personnel. Each district
will publicize the dates when its units will start to use the NOV option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of the NOV option is initially being limited, by Commandant Directive, to violations of specified regulations
and statutory requirements subject to Class I Administrative Civil Penalties under the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act (FWPCA), as amended. A NOV can be issued for two types of violations: (1) oil discharges in violation of
the FWPCA, if they are 100 gallons or less, and (2) violations of pollution prevention regulations (33 CFR Parts 154,
155, 156) for which the current penalty guidelines list a penalty not greater than $2500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Coast Guard issuing officers can issue a NOV only in cases that meet specific written guidance. Penalty amounts are
taken from a penalty schedule and may not be increased or decreased by the issuing officer. Any case in which aggravating
or extenuating circumstances are involved, or in which the violations do not meet the specific written guidance,
is not eligible for NOV issuance and will be processed for referral to the Hearing Officer in accordance with normal
procedures.

The District Commander now has more flexibility to delegate authority for review of alleged violations to any member
under the District Commander's command. For example, the District Commander may now delegate case review authority
to the Captain of the Port for certain pollution prevention violations, thus eliminating the need for review by the
District Commander's staff prior to forwarding the case to a Hearing Officer. The expanded delegation authority
allows District Commanders greater flexibility in allocating their personnel resources to process violation cases.

I. General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Interim rule language of &sect;1.07&hyph;11 and the NOV form used for the pilot program left the impression that
a party could request a hearing on the proposed penalty offered by the NOV. In fact, if a party does not wish to accept
the NOV, a full case is forwarded to the Hearing Officer who then makes an independent determination and issues a preliminary
assessment letter to which the party can respond. To clarify this procedure &sect;1.07&hyph;11 now specifies that
the NOV include a statement that the party may decline the NOV and, if the NOV is declined, the party has the right to a
hearing prior to a final assessment of a penalty by a Hearing Officer. The NOV also states that taking no action on the
NOV has the same result as declining the NOV but the processing time may increase. Furthermore, the NOV form makes it
clear that the Hearing Officer is in no way bound by any assessment proposed by the NOV. To facilitate understanding
of these rights the NOV form is reproduced in Figure 1.

Two comments received during the pilot program were in favor of the regulations and suggested that the NOV option be
broadened to include other Coast Guard programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NOV option can be used by other Coast Guard programs that use the civil penalty process. Any program that implements
use of the NOV option will do so by internal policy with prior notification to the public in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments were in favor of the alternative process but suggested different penalty amounts for small oil spills
and pollution prevention regulation violations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The penalty amounts specified for small oil spills and pollution prevention regulation violations used during the
pilot program were based on current Commandant's policy guidelines for assessing Coast Guard civil penalties. These
penalty amounts are reviewed regularly to ensure that they reflect a fair and equitable enforcement policy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pilot program results indicated that the current small oil spill penalties were appropriate. However, the Coast
Guard has revised some penalties for pollution prevention violations. Results of the pilot program indicated that
using the same penalty amounts for pollution prevention violations as those specified in the current Commandant's
policy guidelines for assessing Coast Guard civil penalties provided no incentive to accept an NOV. To encourage
acceptance of the NOV, pollution prevention violations that have a recommended penalty of $2,500 or less under the
Commandant's civil penalty guidelines will be proposed on an NOV at 75% of the amount listed for the specific offense.
Pollution prevention violations that have a recommended penalty of $2,500 or more under the Commandant's civil penalty
guidelines are no longer eligible for issuance of an NOV and will be sent to the Hearing Officer for a determination.
The NOV option will be closely monitored to determine if additional spill categories or different penalties are needed
in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two comments asked that the determination of first offense be based on the record of each platform or vessel, not the
company as a whole. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard agrees that for purposes of NOV issuance each platform, vessel, or unit should be treated separately
when determining whether or not it is a first offense for the purpose of assessing penalties. This is reflected in the
NOV implementation guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment indicated that Coast Guard petty officers do not have the experience to make a judgment as to when to issue
a NOV and that any assessment should only be made after review by a higher ranking authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard disagrees. Coast Guard Petty Officers selected as issuing officers are trained professionals who
have demonstrated knowledge and ability in their field. Before any Petty Officer investigates a violation and issues
a NOV, he or she is first given proper instruction and is determined to be qualified by his or her command. Issuing officers,
however, have no discretion in assessing penalty amounts. If an NOV is issued, the penalty amount is taken directly
from the implementing guidance. If the offense does not meet specific criteria in the guidance, an NOV cannot be issued.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment stated that a party should be given the right to be heard prior to the issuance of a NOV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard disagrees. A party is not entitled to a hearing prior to initiation of civil penalty action. Under Coast
Guard procedures, the ``initiation of civil penalty action'' occurs with the Letter of Notification from a Hearing
Officer, or in some cases with the NOV. The NOV does not take away any rights a party has to a hearing. The NOV procedure
is voluntary, and the recipient of an NOV may opt to have the case processed under ordinary procedures which include
the right to a hearing before disposition on the case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments expressed general confusion over how the NOV option will work and concern about the protection of rights
for a party issued an NOV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NOV is an opportunity to use an optional procedure for processing civil penalty cases. It may be declined by a party.
The NOV form states that a party may decline the NOV, which will immediately result in a violation case being forwarded
through the appropriate district to a Hearing Officer for determination. The form also states that taking no action
on the NOV has the same result as declining the NOV. A ``no action'' response will, however, delay the referral of the
case to the District for review because the 45-day from issuance period must elapse before the Coast Guard begins processing
the case under normal procedures. A change has been made to &sect;1.07&hyph;11(b)(6) to reflect this procedure.

Three comments expressed concern that the implementing guidance was not provided to the public during the pilot program.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of individuals requested, and were provided, the Coast Guard's NOV guidance during the pilot program. A copy
of current implementing guidance is available by writing to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marine Environmental Protection Division (G&hyph;MEP), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW.,
room 3406, Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments felt that a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) should have been published instead of an interim final
rule (IFR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The changes to 33 CFR 1.07 are procedural and provide a benefit to the public. Thus, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3) a NPRM was
not necessary. An IFR was published to provide a regulatory basis to conduct the pilot program. Comments were encouraged
and a six month comment period was established. All comments were considered in implementing this final rule. The
NOV procedure is optional and use of the procedure provides a benefit to the public. The IFR, however, requested comments
both on the procedure and on its implementation. Those comments were considered before issuing this Final Rule, however
no comments resulted in substantial change to the IFR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment expressed concern that Coast Guard personnel would be over-zealous in their prosecution of civil penalty
cases against small business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NOV option has safeguards built in to protect from such an occurrence. The criteria for using an NOV is based on the
size of a spill and the violation history of the party to whom it may be issued. Issuing officers may not deviate from
this criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment encouraged the Coast Guard to proceed with a final rule but make sure that all rights of a party are preserved
and that ``no response'' should not be interpreted as acceptance of a penalty. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously discussed, ``no response'' will result in processing of a violation through ordinary procedures as
if a NOV had never been issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked that the NOV be provided to an officer of the company that is being cited rather than an employee who
may not pass it to the appropriate official. The comment also suggested that 60 days is a more reasonable time to respond.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the purpose of the NOV option is to provide immediate notification of a settlement offer, it is impractical to
always deliver the NOV to a company officer. Further, the NOV may be against an individual, not a company. Every effort
is made to ensure that the correct responsible party is identified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As to the length of time to pay an NOV, the Coast Guard agrees that 30 days was too short a period. As a result of the pilot
program the Coast Guard had already decided to lengthen the time a party has to respond to an NOV. During the pilot program
the number of NOVs paid within 30 days was approximately 65%, while payment before 45 days exceeded 85%. Therefore,
the deadline for payment of a penalty in a NOV in order to avoid submission of the case to the Hearing Officer established
in &sect;1.07&hyph;11(b)(4) has been changed from 30 to 45 days.

Regulatory Evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No comments were received on the draft regulatory evaluation. This rule is not a significant regulatory action under
section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section
6(a)(3) of that order. It is not significant under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures''
(44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects there to be minimal economic impact from this procedural
rule and a full Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary. The total annual cost to the public from civil penalties is not
increased by this rule. Both the public and the government should realize savings from the reduction in administrative
processing costs through eliminating the need for review by the District Commander and action by the Hearing Officer
in those cases in which the penalty specified in a NOV is paid within the allowed time by the party.

Small Entities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Only one comment was received on the impact of the interim rule on small entities. That comment concerned potential
over-zealous enforcement and is discussed in the comment section of this preamble. Under the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), the Coast Guard considered whether this rulemaking would have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are
not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small
Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). This rule is administrative in nature, making final an alternate method of processing
violation cases. The total number of civil penalties levied against the public does not substantially change as the
result of this regulation. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

No comments were received on the federalism implications of the interim rule. The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule
under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not have
sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

impact of this rulemaking and concluded that, under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.lB, this rule
is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. Procedural rules do not require environmental
impact studies.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Coast Guard is redesignating and revising certain regulations relating to delegation of authority. The changes
incorporate amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) made by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA
90); provisions added to the United States Code by OPA 90; and certain provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act of 1986 (SARA). These statutes relate to discharges and releases of oil, hazardous substances, pollutants, and
contaminants. The changes reflect, in large part, additional responsibilities assigned to Coast Guard On-Scene
Coordinators to direct responses to spills of oil and hazardous substances.

Background and Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) [Pub. L. 101&hyph;380] amended several provisions of section 311 of the Federal
Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) [33 U.S.C. 1321] relating to the prevention of and response to discharges of oil
and hazardous substances. Several new functions under both OPA 90 and the amended section 311 of the FWPCA were vested
in the President. Others were vested in the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. Executive
Order 12777 [3 CFR, 1991 Comp., p. 351, 56 FR 54757, October 22, 1991] assigned many new functions and reassigned many
preexisting functions to the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary reassigned many new and preexisting
functions to the Commandant of the Coast Guard [49 CFR 1.46 (l), (m), and (ll)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commandant, by internal directive dated March 19, 1992, redelegated most of the functions under OPA 90 and section
311 of the FWPCA. Copies of the Commandant's redelegation memorandum are available by calling G&hyph;MEP at the telephone
number listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments to 33 CFR subpart 1.01 in this rulemaking reflect much of that redelegation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rules also delegate authority to Coast Guard officials to carry out certain functions under CERCLA, as amended
by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) [42 U.S.C. 9601,

., Pub. L. 96&hyph;510, 94 Stat. 2767, as amended by Pub. L. 99&hyph;499, 100 Stat. 1613] relating to the release of
hazardous substances. Executive Order 12580 delegated the President's functions under CERCLA, as amended, to the
heads of various Executive Branch departments and agencies, including the Secretary of Transportation [3 CFR, 1987
Comp., p. 193, 52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987]. The Secretary of Transportation has redelegated certain functions to
the Commandant of the Coast Guard [49 CFR 1.46 (ff) and (gg)]. This rule further delegates authority to designated
Coast Guard officials under CERCLA relating to the enforcement of financial- responsibility requirements, including
the assessment of civil penalties.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1.01&hyph;30 is revised to delete reference to the authority of command, warrant, and petty officers of the
Coast Guard to assist in discharging the duties of the Captain of the Port. This authority is now contained in a new &sect;1.01&hyph;90
which reflects that the authority exists to carry out the functions of District and Area Commanders, and Officers
in Charge, Marine Inspection in addition to Captains of the Ports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.01&hyph;70 is revised to reflect delegations of authority under CERCLA to each District Commander to enforce
requirements for financial responsibility of vessels and the assessment of civil penalties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.01&hyph;80 is added to reflect delegations to Area and District Commanders that are currently located
in &sect;153.105(a); delegations of authority to the Coast Guard's Chief, Office of Marine Safety, Security, and
Environmental Protection, that are currently located in &sect;153.105(b); and delegations to On-Scene Coordinators
that are currently located in &sect;153.105(c). The text of &sect;1.01&hyph;80 also includes delegations of functions
under provisions of OPA 90, such as new authority for assessment of civil penalties provided in section 4303 of OPA
90 [33 U.S.C. 2716a], and amendments to section 311 of the FWPCA regarding additional authority for inspection and
entry provided in section 4305 of OPA 90 [33 U.S.C. 1321(m)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.01&hyph;85 is added by redesignating the delegations of authority currently found in 153.107 and revising
them with respect to officers under the staff and command of individuals delegated authority in &sect;1.01&hyph;80.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.01&hyph;90 is added to allow authorization of any commissioned, warrant, or petty officer of the U.S. Coast
Guard to carry out functions delegated to superior officials under &sect;&sect;1.01&hyph;1, 1.01&hyph;20, 1.01&hyph;30,
1.01&hyph;70, and 1.01&hyph;80, or redelegated under &sect;1.01&hyph;85, within the jurisdiction of the cognizant
official.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 153.107 is removed; and the text, revised to cite &sect;1.01&hyph;80 authorities, is included in new &sect;1.01&hyph;85.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an
assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) [44 FR 11304 (February 26, 1979)]. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact
of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures
of DOT is unnecessary. This rulemaking expedites the Coast Guard's ability to respond to discharges of oil and hazardous
substances and thereby limits the potential effect of those discharges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the changes to its regulations relate to agency management and organization, the Coast Guard finds that under
the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) [5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2)] notice and the opportunity for public comment are unnecessary.
Further, since the regulations are being revised to accurately reflect statutory changes, the Coast Guard finds
good cause under the APA [5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)] for the final rule to be effective on the date of publication in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.], the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed
rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000. This rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore,
is exempt from the requirements of the Act. Although this rule is exempt, the Coast Guard has reviewed it for potential
impact on small entities.

This rule will have no adverse impacts, economic or other. It improves the Coast Guard's ability to respond to discharges
of oil and hazardous substances. Therefore, the Coast Guard's position is that this rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return,
communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management measures aimed at protecting lives and new
construction from future flooding. Since the communities on the attached list have recently entered the NFIP, subsidized
flood insurance is now available for property in the community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas
in some of these communities by publishing a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The
date of the flood map, if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. In the communities listed
where a flood map has been published, Section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 42 U.S.C.
4012(a), requires the purchase of flood insurance as a condition of Federal or federally related financial assistance
for acquisition or construction of buildings in the special flood hazard areas shown on the map. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director finds that the delayed effective dates would be contrary to the public interest. The Director also finds
that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary.

The Associate Director certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Summary of Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 409(e) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Act), 47 U.S.C. &sect;409(e), grants the Commission
express authority to require by subpoena information relating to any matter under investigation. This authority
may be delegated in accordance with Section 5(c)(1) of the Act. 47 U.S.C. &sect;155(c)(1). The agency's power of subpoena
is not confined to those over whom it exercises regulatory jurisdiction, but extends to private individuals and entities
over whom it does not.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. We find that the delegation of authority to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, to issue administrative subpoenas
in the investigation of matters involving any alleged violation or violations of Title II of the Act will facilitate
investigations of unlawful activity by common carriers and is, therefore, in the public interest.

3. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, that, pursuant to Section 5(c)(1) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47
U.S.C. &sect;155(c)(1), authority is delegated to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau, to require by administrative
subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, correspondence, memoranda,
schedules of charges, contracts, agreements, and any other records deemed relevant to the investigation of common
carriers for any alleged violation or violations of Title II of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. It is further ordered that &sect;0.291 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 0.291, be amended to add a paragraph (j)
to reflect this delegation of authority. This amendment of the Commission's rules is contained below. The requirement
of notice and comment rule making contained in 5 U.S.C. &sect;553(b) and the effective date provisions of 5 U.S.C.
&sect;553(d) do not apply since this amendment concerns matters of agency organization, procedure, or practice.

A final rule implementing Amendment 8 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Atlantic Surf Clam and Ocean Quahog Fishery
(FMP) was published on June 14, 1990 (55 FR 24184). Section 652.22(a)(1) allows the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS,
(Regional Director) to suspend annually, by publication of a document in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the minimum size limit for Atlantic surf clams. This action may be taken unless discard, catch, and survey data indicate
that 30 percent of the Atlantic surf clam resource is smaller than 4.75 inches (12.065 cm), and the overall reduced
size is not attributable to beds where growth of the individual clams has been reduced because of density-dependent
factors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its September meeting, the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) accepted the recommendations
of its Statistical and Scientific Committee and Surf Clam/Ocean Quahog Committee and voted to recommend that the
Regional Director suspend the minimum size limit. NMFS port agents conducted a random sample of landed surf clams
in 1994. Results indicate that only 27.33 percent of the sample was composed of clams that were less than 4.75 inches
(12.065 cm). Based on the sampling results, the Regional Director adopts the Council's recommendation and publishes
this notice to suspend the minimum size limit for Atlantic surf clams for the period January 1, 1995, through December
31, 1995.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule revises the HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 570, subpart F, which govern the administration of the Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) Small Cities Program. The purpose of subpart F is to set forth the procedures by which
CDBG funds are provided to non-entitled units of general local government in those States which have 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 elected to assume administration of the CDBG formula allocations for use in non-entitled units of general local government
within such States. The rule amends subpart F to incorporate the statutory changes made to the Small Cities Program
since the subpart F regulations were issued in 1982, and streamlines the operation and administration of the program.
In addition, the rule makes additional changes to subpart F, and various changes to subparts I and M which are necessary
to permit use of the section 108 loan guarantee authority by non-entitled units of general local government in States
which have not elected to assume administration of the CDBG formula allocations for nonentitlement areas of such
States.

I. Background_September 15, 1994 Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 15, 1994 (59 FR 47500), HUD published a proposed rule that would amend HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part
570, subpart F, which govern the administration of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Small Cities Program.
The proposed rule provided for a 30-day public comment period. By the end of the comment period on October 17, 1994,
21 comments had been received. The 21 commenters consisted of 11 units of general local government (7 New York, 3 Hawaii,
1 Arizona), 5 consultants, and 5 public and private non-profits. These commenters made approximately 75 different
comments about the September 15, 1994 proposed rule; many of these comments were made by more than one commenter. Section
II of this preamble describes the changes made to the proposed rule at the final rule stage, and Section III of the preamble
sets forth the issues and questions raised by the public commenters, and HUD's responses to these issues and questions.

II. Principal Differences Between Proposed Rule and Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is substantially the same as the September 15, 1994 proposed rule. The principal differences are as
follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Multiyear Plans 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule provides that HUD may issue notices of funding availability that provide for a competition for applications
that have multiyear plans (see &sect;570.421(a)(2)).

2. Economic Development Grants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule also provides that HUD intends to use the section 108 loan guarantee program to the maximum extent feasible
to fund economic development projects in the nonentitlement areas of New York State (see &sect;570.421(a)(5)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

3. Counties Applying on Behalf of Units of General Local Government 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule provides criteria under which counties may apply on behalf of units of general local government located
within their jurisdiction when the unit of general local government has authorized the county to apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Pre-Agreement Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule provides that HUD authorizes a unit of general local government to incur costs during the same or the
prior Federal Fiscal Year for preparation of a CDBG grant application, planning costs eligible under &sect;570.205,
environmental assessments, and project engineering and design costs for eligible activities under &sect;570.201&hyph;204
before the establishment of a formal grant relationship between the applicant and HUD. Such costs for the funded activities
may be charged to the grant should it be funded, provided that the activities are undertaken in accordance with the
requirements of subpart F (see &sect;570.425(a)(3)). This includes compliance with selection of contractors under
24 CFR 85.36 if, for example, a contractor prepares the application or plans and specifications.

5. HUD Action on Final Application 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule adds two new paragraphs to &sect;570.425(b). Paragraph (b)(3) provides that HUD will not make a Small
Cities grant when it is determined that the grant will only have a minimal or insignificant impact on the grantee. Paragraph
(b)(4) provides that in determining appropriate grant amounts to be awarded, HUD may take into account the size of
the applicant, the level of demand, the scale of the activity proposed relative to need and operational capacity,
among others. (See &sect;570.425(b) (3) and (4).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule adds a new paragraph (c) to &sect;570.425 to provide for streamlined application requirements for
previous applicants. (See &sect;570.425(c).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
7. Clarification of ``Publication of Proposed Application'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule adds a new paragraph to &sect;570.431(c) to explain what is meant by publication of the proposed application.
(See &sect;570.431(c)(4).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule clarifies the procedures that Hawaii grantees must follow in making amendments to final applications.
(See &sect;570.431(f).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule extends the deadline for New York Grantees to submit their performance and evaluation report on the
small cities grant to October 31 (see &sect;570.507(a)(2)(ii)(A)) and sets forth the date Hawaii grantees must submit
their performance and evaluation report (see &sect;570.507(a)(2)(ii)(B).)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section sets forth the issues and comments made by the public commenters on the September 15, 1994 proposed rule,
and HUD's responses to these issues and questions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments Concerning NOFA for Small Cities Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were several comments that the application time period to respond to the Small Cities NOFA should be more than
60 days. The final rule will not establish the application time period for the Small Cities NOFA. The request for a longer
application time period was taken into consideration in development of the Federal Fiscal Year (FY) 1995 NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ten commenters commented on the number of funding competitions that should be held for the Small Cities Program during
each fiscal year. Since the optimum number of competitive rounds will vary according to circumstances, the Small
Cities NOFA will state the number of competitions that will be held in the time period that is covered by the NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters stated that the issue date for the NOFA and the due date of competitive applications should be established
by regulation. To retain maximum flexibility to address changing conditions, the Department has decided that these
dates should not be established by regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters submitted comments on the maximum grant limits. In order to retain flexibility due to changing conditions
such as inflation, the Small Cities NOFA, rather than the rule, will address the issue of grant limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that the Department establish a set amount of funding for each funding round. Although the
Department agrees with this comment, the NOFA rather than the rule is a better vehicle to address this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that if it was necessary to expand the competition beyond housing, public facilities, and economic
development, the final rule should so state this. Since it is impossible to foresee the types of competition that might
benefit small jurisdictions in the State of New York in the future, the rule provides in &sect;570.421(a)(1) that
there will be competitive applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters commented on the application page limits. Again, this is an issue that will be addressed in the NOFA
to retain flexibility to adjust page limit requirements. The Department acknowledges that reducing the size of grant
applications will reduce paperwork which is a goal shared by the majority of participants at the meetings held in the
State of New York to discuss the proposed regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters requested that the Small Cities NOFA remain as constant as possible from year to year. The Department
intends to do this to the extent possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter asked that the Department provide technical assistance after the issuance of the NOFA. Although this
matter is not one that should be addressed in the final rule, the Department intends to provide the maximum amount of
technical assistance that is permitted under section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform
Act.

Another commenter requested that the Department provide an even playing field for small communities. In the history
of the program, small communities have been successful in obtaining grants, and the Department sees no need to change
the final rule in this regard.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter requested that people with rural backgrounds be involved in the rulemaking process. This was accomplished
by two highly publicized meetings with that were held in Auburn and Goshen, New York as well as having the Assistant
Secretary for Community Planning and Development write to each eligible unit of general local government individually,
asking for their comments in helping to shape the final rule and NOFA.

Administration of Small Cities Program by the State of New York
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters stated that the Small Cities Program should not be given to New York State to administer. Section 106
(d)(2) of Title I, gives States the right to elect to administer the State CDBG Program. The Department cannot administratively
amend this provision.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters asked that the Single Audit and Davis-Bacon Acts be made inapplicable to the Small Cities Program. To adopt
this comment would require a statutory change.

Rehabilitation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters asked that the non-targeted rehabilitation program be continued. Although this issue is too specific
to be addressed by the regulations, there is nothing in the Small Cities regulations that would preclude a grantee
from initiating a non-targeted rehabilitation program. A request was made by one commenter to fund more HUD staff
travel. Although the Department is sensitive to the need of HUD Field staff to travel to small cities in New York, the
travel budget is determined by annual appropriations and is not an appropriate issue to be addressed by the final regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that funds should be allowed to be used to rehabilitate pre-1976 mobile homes. While the Department
is unclear as to the commenters' reference to pre-1976 mobile homes, manufactured housing can be rehabilitated in
accordance with &sect;570.202(a)(4), since the State of New York recognizes manufactured housing as real property.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that senior citizens on fixed income should be able to get rehabilitation grants. The major purpose
of the CDBG program is to benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Senior citizens who are of low- and moderate-income
are eligible to receive housing rehabilitation grants. Senior citizens who have higher incomes cannot receive grants
unless the activity is to aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight. Title I does not give higher income
senior citizens preference over low- and moderate-income non senior citizens.

Household Incomes

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asked that households with incomes between 80&hyph;100 percent of median be eligible to receive rehabilitation
assistance in non-targeted areas. The Department notes that this can be done under &sect;570.208(b)(2) as long as
the rehabilitation is limited to the extent necessary to eliminate specific conditions detrimental to public health
and safety.

Multiyear Plans
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter said that community facilities should not be funded on a multiyear basis, but should be funded through
a large grant of up to $900,000. The Department decided not to restrict community facilities from being part of multiyear
plan projects. However, to the extent a project consisting, for example, of one large building cannot logically be
subdivided into segments that are viable as separate grants, the project would have to be funded from a single year's
grant funds under &sect;570.421(a)(1). Larger public facilities projects, however, can now be funded with Section
108 loan guarantee assistance under &sect;570.703(l). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter said that the first year of the multiyear plan should be fifteen months, and another commenter indicated
that there should be a site visit 9&hyph;10 months into the multiyear plan. These comments are operational in nature
and not appropriate to be addressed by the final rule.

Priority for EZs/ECs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that Empowerment Zones (EZ) and Enterprise Communities (EC) should not receive a priority in
the final regulation. The Department agrees that the final regulation is an inappropriate place to show support for
the EZ/EC program and can more appropriately lend its support in the NOFA.

Public Hearings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A commenter stated that public hearings should be able to be combined with hearings for other purposes. The Department
agrees, and notes that this is the Department's policy, and therefore, need not be stated specifically in the final
rule.

Abbreviated Consolidated Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters requested that the abbreviated Consolidated Plan requirements be made as simple as possible.
It is the Department's intention to do this, but the NOFA is a more appropriate vehicle for doing this since the abbreviated
Consolidated Plan may need to be changed based on ongoing experience in program administration. At this time the abbreviated
Consolidated Plan is not yet required. (The FY 1995 NOFA requires an abbreviated CHAS if the application contains
housing activities.) After the Consolidated Plan final rule is published, succeeding NOFAs will explain the requirements.
The final rule for the Consolidated Plan will make conforming changes to this regulation. The final rule will not apply
to applications under the FY 1995 NOFA for the State of New York.

B. Specific Comments on Rule Sections
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 570.420&blank;General
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Five commenters call for the abbreviated CHAS requirement to be eliminated. Section 570.420(d) requires that there
be a certification in the Small Cities application that housing activities proposed to be funded by the Small Cities
Program must be consistent with the applicant's abbreviated CHAS. This is required by 24 CFR part 91 and Section 105(b)
of the National Affordable Housing Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter wanted to lower the requirement that 70 percent of the grant funds must be used to benefit low-and moderate-income
persons to 51 percent. The Department believes that the commenter misunderstands the requirement. Under &sect;570.208(a)(1),
if at least 51 percent of the residents of an area are low- and moderate-income persons, an activity that benefits that
area is considered to benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Section 570.200(a)(3)(v) provides that area benefit
activities are to count as benefitting low- and moderate-income persons 100 percent. Accordingly, if a water project
is funded for $300,000, which benefits an area that is 57 percent low-and moderate-income, the entire $300,000 is
considered to be benefitting low- and moderate-income persons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters said that the regulations should clearly state that &sect;570.200(a)(3)(iii) applies, and that
grantees should not include Section 108 loan repayments in the calculations for meeting the objective that not less
than 70 percent of the total of grant funds from each grant and Section 108 loan guarantee funds received under 24 CFR
part 570, subpart M, within a fiscal year, must be expended for activities that benefit low-and moderate-income persons.
The Department agrees and paragraph (e)(2) was revised to incorporate this change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Eight commenters protested the elimination of the rating and ranking scoring factors from the regulations. As a result
of these comments, &sect;570.421(a) has been added to the final rule to describe the selection system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were multiple comments recommending that the Department establish an Economic Development set-aside with
an open window, so that economic development applications could be submitted at any time during the year. Commenters
also suggested that Section 108 loan guarantees be used to fund economic development projects to the greatest extent
possible. These comments are addressed in &sect;570.421(a)(5), which provides that the Department will use the
Section 108 loan guarantee program to the greatest extent possible to fund Economic Development projects, and that
the Department will fund Economic Development applications as they are determined to be fundable in a specific amount
by HUD. All Economic Development projects that are funded with Small Cities funds must have a substantial impact on
the needs identified by the applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that only housing and public facilities applications should be funded during the competitive
funding cycles. Under the new &sect;570.421(a) (``Selection system''), both competitive applications and the
first year of multiyear plans will be funded on a competitive basis with the NOFA indicating how that competition will
be held. Since ``Economic Development'' and ``Imminent Threat'' projects funded on a non-competitive basis, the
competition will essentially include housing, public facilities, and comprehensive applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter suggested that the division between comprehensive projects and single purpose projects be retained
with an eye towards evening the chances of obtaining funding from both types of projects. Another commenter requested
that funding be continued for comprehensive grants. The nomenclature of single purpose and comprehensive projects
has been removed from the final rule, but the Department may elect to retain and define such categories in a NOFA. Under
the final rule, there will be competitions for competitive applications and multiyear plans with the funding divided
between the categories fine-tuned by a NOFA that will be issued each year. The former single purpose projects will
be eligible for funding as competitive applications. The former comprehensive projects may be funded as either competitive
applications or as multiyear grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requested that the Department allow counties to apply on behalf of municipalities. This suggestion
was incorporated into the final rule at 24 CFR 570.421(c)(3). Another commenter suggested that the Department encourage
county-wide applications. County-wide applications are eligible for funding and will receive the same consideration
as all other applications for Small Cities funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Six commenters requested that the Department allow multiyear funding for comprehensive grants. This comment was
adopted in &sect;570.421(a)(2) of the final rule, which will allow the Department to fund multiyear plans. After
the first year of a multiyear plan is funded, the Department may fund future years on a non-competitive basis subject
to acceptable performance, submission of an acceptable application and certifications, and the provision of adequate
appropriations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that multiyear grantees should not receive other grants during the time period that the multiyear
grant was ongoing. The Department decided that this issue is more appropriately addressed in the NOFA rather than
the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested that consideration be given to female and disabled heads of household in giving fair
housing points and contracts given to female-owned businesses should be taken into account in reporting minority
business enterprise achievements. In order to retain flexibility to address changing priorities, the Department
decided that the makeup of the fair housing and equal opportunity points will be disseminated in the NOFA rather than
the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three commenters wanted the imminent threat set-aside retained in the final rule, and one commenter wanted it deleted.
The Department decided to retain the imminent threat set-aside to give the Department the flexibility to respond
immediately to threats to health and safety such as flood damage from hurricanes.

HUD Review and Actions on Applications for New York State Applicants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter said that if there was more than one funding round in a fiscal year, an unsuccessful application should
be able to be resubmitted in the next round. The Department agrees and paragraph (c) was added to &sect;570.425 which
authorizes HUD to provide in a NOFA that unsuccessful applications will be automatically held over for the succeeding
rounds of competition if the applicant so requests in writing. The applicant will have the option of amending or withdrawing
its application. For FY 1995, applications not funded in FY 1994 will automatically be reconsidered under the FY 1995
NOFA unless the applicant notifies HUD otherwise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter indicated that HUD should ensure that applications are funded for the least amount of funds necessary
to implement the proposed activities. As a result of this comment, paragraph (b)(4) was added to &sect;570.425 of
the final rule. This paragraph gives the Department the right to take into account the size of the applicant, the level
of demand, the scale of the activity proposed relative to need and operational capacity, the number of persons to be
served, the amount of funds required to achieve project objectives and the administrative capacity of the applicant
to complete the activities in a timely manner in determining the appropriate grant amount to award. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To respond to a commenter's request to even the playing field for smaller communities, the Department has revised
&sect;570.425(a)(3) in the final rule to allow units of general local government to incur costs for certain CDBG grant
activities before the establishment of a formal grant relationship and charge the pre-agreement costs to the grant,
should it be funded. This includes the cost of application preparation, but does not create an obligation on part of
the Department to fund the application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wrote favorably of &sect;570.426(c) which provides that if a unit of general local government has no
open CDBG grant at the time of closeout, program income of less than $25,000 per year after closeout will not be considered
program income, and will not be subject to the requirements of this part. This provision has been retained in the final
regulation.

Section 570.429&blank;Hawaii General and Grant Requirements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three counties in the State of Hawaii commented that they did not want the method of distribution of Hawaii Small Cities
funds to be changed by the issuance of a NOFA because that would impinge upon the ability of the Hawaii grantees to plan
for future use of Small Cities funds. The Department agrees with this comment, and all references to a NOFA for the Hawaii
Small Cities program were removed from &sect;570.429. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters from the State of Hawaii thought that paragraph (d)(1) of &sect;570.429 should be revised to better
define ``capacity to utilize the grant amount effectively and efficiently''. This term was used in the previous regulation
at &sect;570.435(c)(1)(ii)(A), and does not need to be redefined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters from the State of Hawaii requested that Hawaii grantees follow the application submission requirements
in 24 CFR part 570, subpart D. Another commenter said that applications should be accepted and not approved. Section
570.429 has been revised to treat the Hawaii grantees as much like entitlement grantees as possible. Since the program
is still discretionary under section 106(d) of Title I, the Department decided that applications should be required
to be submitted and approved. Paragraph (g) of &sect;570.429 indicates that the Department will approve the application
unless it is shown that ``one or more of the following requirements (relating to completeness, timeliness, certifications,
and compliance with this part) have not been met''. This provision gives assurance to Hawaii grantees that applications
that are complete, timely, contain the proper certifications, and which are otherwise in compliance with this part
will be approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter from the State of Hawaii asked that paragraph (d)(2) of &sect;570.429 regarding timely expenditures
only consider grants from FY 1995 onward. Since it is the policy of the Department to encourage timely expenditures,
the Department decided that all outstanding grants should be used in calculating timely expenditures under &sect;570.902(a).
The Department notes that Kauai's disaster grant will not be considered in the calculations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule on the Consolidated Plan, which will be published shortly, will change the application, citizen participation,
approval and reporting requirements for the Hawaii grantees. These changes will be incorporated into subpart F at
the time the final consolidated plan regulation is promulgated. In view of the probable timing of submission of applications
by Hawaii grantees, it is anticipated that these rule changes will apply to FY 1995 applications by Hawaii grantees.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that paragraph (a) of &sect;570.430 should be clarified to indicate that grants received in
FY 1995 and thereafter are grants made from FY 1995 allocations and thereafter, and that grants made prior to FY 1995
are grants from allocations prior to FY 1995. This revision has been made in the final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four comments from the State of Hawaii concerned citizen participation requirements. One commenter requested that
paragraph (e) of &sect;570.431 be revised to indicate that the citizen participation requirements apply to the State
of Hawaii, and two commenters requested that the entitlement citizen participation process be followed, and one
commenter requested that the entitlement amendment process be followed by Hawaii grantees. The Department has decided
to add a new paragraph (f) to &sect;570.431 to clarify the requirements that Hawaii Small Cities grantees must follow.
The citizen participation requirements are being included in the Small Cities final rule for clarity. It is noted
that the citizen participation requirements for Hawaii grantees will be revised shortly, when the final rule on consolidated
planning requirements is published.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six commenters stated that Section 108 funds should not be used for the New York Small Cities Program because repayment
will come from the total allocation of discretionary Small Cities funding for the State of New York. One commenter
said that Section 108 funds must be backed by the community's own resources. In making non-entitled units of general
local government in the State of New York eligible for the Section 108 program, the Department intends to provide small
communities with the opportunity to fund large economic development projects_projects that they would not ordinarily
be able to fund. Since it is envisioned that a significant portion of economic development funding will come from the
Section 108 loan guarantee fund rather than the HUD-administered Small Cities Program, there will be more Small Cities
funds available to fund non-economic development projects, even if a small portion of funds are used under &sect;570.432
to repay amounts due on Section 108 loan obligations. All Section 108 loan obligations will be underwritten to ensure
that only high quality projects are funded. In addition, the Department is considering instituting loan insurance
pools to further ensure that the cost to the Small Cities Program will be minimized.

rule. (See &sect;570.507(a)(2)(ii)(A).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three commenters from the State of Hawaii requested that HUD consider a uniform period of activity for their Small

this.

Two commenters requested that the Department make available the Section 108 Loan Guarantee Program to non-entitled

A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24
CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, at the time of the
development of the proposed rule. Because no substantial programmatic changes have been made, that finding remains
applicable to this final rule. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection during regular
business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410.

The Secretary, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), has reviewed this final rule
before publication, and by approving it certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. The rule proposes to modify, simplify and update the administration and
procedural requirements of the CDBG Small Cities Program to conform with legislation applicable to this program.
Accordingly, the final rule is anticipated to have some beneficial impact on small entities. However, the number
of small entities that may be affected by this rule will not be substantial and the economic impact will not be significant.

HUD administration of nonentitlement CDBG funds. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 permits each State to elect to administer all aspects of
the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program annual fund allocation for the nonentitlement areas within
its jurisdiction. This subpart sets forth policies and procedures applicable to grants for nonentitlement areas
in States that have not elected to administer the CDBG Program. States that elected to administer the program after
the close of fiscal year 1984 cannot return administration of the program to HUD. A decision by a State to discontinue
administration of the program would result in the loss of CDBG funds for nonentitled areas in that State and the reallocation
of those funds to all States in the succeeding fiscal year.

Scope and applicability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) This subpart describes the policies and procedures of the Small Cities Program which apply to nonentitlement
areas in States where HUD administers the CDBG Program. HUD currently administers the Small Cities Program in only
two States_New York and Hawaii. This subpart principally addresses the requirements for New York, and &sect;570.429&hyph;30
identifies special procedures applicable to Hawaii. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The allocation of formula CDBG funds for use in nonentitled areas of Hawaii and New York is as provided in subpart
A of this part. The policies and procedures set forth in the following identified subparts of this part 570 apply to
the HUD-administered Small Cities Program, except as modified or limited under the provisions thereof or this subpart:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Subpart A_General Provisions; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Subpart C_Eligible Activities;

(iii) Subpart J_Grant Administration;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public notification requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545) contains a number
of provisions that are designed to ensure greater accountability and integrity in the provision of certain types
of assistance administered by HUD. All competitive grants in the HUD-administered Small Cities Program in New York
are affected by this legislation, and the requirements identified at 24 CFR part 12 apply to them. Imminent threat
grants under &sect;570.424 and section 108 repayment grants under &sect;570.432 are not affected by section 102
as they are not competitive grants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Hawaii HUD-administered Small Cities Program is not subject to section 102, since the funds are not distributed
in a competitive manner.

Applications for the HUD-administered Small Cities Program which contain housing activities must include a certification
that the proposed housing activities are consistent with the applicant's Comprehensive Housing Affordability
Strategy as described at 24 CFR part 91.

(i) Benefit low- and moderate-income families; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Aid in the prevention or elimination of slums or blight; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Be an activity which the grantee certifies is designed to meet other community development needs having a particular
urgency because existing conditions pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the community
where other financial resources are not available to meet such needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In addition to the objectives described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, with respect to grants made through
the Small Cities Program, not less than 70 percent of the total of grant funds from each grant and Section 108 loan guarantee
funds received under subpart M of this part within a fiscal year must be expended for activities which benefit low-
and moderate-income persons under the criteria of &sect;570.208(a). In the case of multiyear plans, in New York State,
not less than 70 percent of the total funding for grants approved pursuant to a multiyear plan for a time period of up
to 3 years must be expended for activities which benefit low- and moderate-income persons. Thus, 70 percent of the
grant for year 1 of a multiyear plan must meet the 70 percent requirement, 70 percent of the combined grants from years
1 and 2 must meet the requirement, and 70 percent of the combined grants from years 1, 2 and 3 must meet the requirement.
In determining the percentage of funds expended for such activity, the provisions of &sect;570.200(a)(3)(i), (iii),
(iv) and (v) shall apply.

The notice of funding availability may provide for a competition for applications that have multiyear plans. The
plans will be rated and scored against factors in paragraph (a)(1) (i) through (iv) of this section. The action plan
for each year of the multiyear plan must be a viable project on its own. If the multiyear plan is selected on a competitive
basis, the first year will be funded and HUD may fund future years on a non-competitive basis subject to acceptable
performance, submission of an acceptable application and certifications, and the provision of adequate appropriations
for the HUD-administered Small Cities Program.

Economic development grants. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD intends to use the Section 108 loan guarantee program to the maximum extent feasible to fund economic development
projects in the nonentitlement areas of New York. In the event that there are not enough Section 108 loan guarantee
funds available to fund viable economic development projects, or if a project needs a grant in addition to a loan guarantee
to make it viable, or if the project does not meet the requirements of the Section 108 program but is eligible for a grant
under this subpart, HUD will fund Economic Development applications as they are determined to be fundable in a specific
amount by HUD up to the sum set aside for economic development projects in the notice of funding availability. HUD also
has the option in a NOFA of funding economic development activities on a competitive basis, as a competitive application
as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In order for an applicant to receive Small Cities grant funds, the
field office must determine that the economic development project will have a substantial impact on the needs identified
by the applicant.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Notice of funding availability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will issue one or more Notice(s) of Funding Availability (NOFA) each fiscal year which will indicate the amount
of funds available, the annual grant limits per grantee, type of grants available, the application requirements,
and the rating factors that will be used for those grants which are competitive. A NOFA may set forth, subject to the
requirements of this subpart, additional selection criteria for all grants.

(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eligible applicants. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Eligible applicants in New York are units of general local government, excluding: Metropolitan cities, urban
counties, units of general local government which are participating in urban counties or metropolitan cities, even
if only part of the participating unit of government is located in the urban county or metropolitan city. Indian tribes
are also ineligible for assistance under this subpart. An application may be submitted individually or jointly by
eligible applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) Counties, cities, towns, and villages may apply and receive funding for separate projects to be done in the same
jurisdiction. Only one grant will be made under each funding round for the same type of project to be located within
the jurisdiction of a unit of general local government (e.g. both the county and village cannot receive funding for
a sewer system to be located in the same village, but the county can receive funding for a sewer system that is located
in the same village as a rehabilitation project for which the village receives funding). The NOFA will contain additional
information on applicant eligibility.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Counties may apply on behalf of units of general local government located within their jurisdiction when the unit
of general local government has authorized the county to apply. At the time that the county submits its application
for funding, it must submit a resolution by the governing body of the unit of local government that authorizes the county
to submit an application on behalf of the unit of general local government. The county will be considered the grantee
and will be responsible for executing all grant documents. The county is responsible for ensuring compliance with
all laws, regulations, and Executive Orders applicable to the CDBG Program. HUD will deal exclusively with the county
with respect to issues of program administration and performance, including remedial actions. The unit of general
local government will be considered the grantee for the purpose of determining grant limits. The unit of general local
government's statistics will be used for purposes of the selection factors referred to in &sect;570.421(a).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Public service activities may be funded up to a maximum of fifteen (15) percent of a State's nonentitlement allocation
for any fiscal year. HUD may award a grant to a unit of general local government for public service activities with up
to 100 percent of the funds intended for public service activities. HUD will apply the 15 percent statewide cap to public
service activities by funding public service activities in the highest rated applications in each NOFA until the
cap is reached.

Units of general local government may submit a joint application which addresses common problems faced by the jurisdictions,
to the extent permitted by the NOFA. A joint application must be pursuant to a written cooperation agreement submitted
with the application. The cooperation agreement must authorize one of the participating units of government to act
as the lead applicant which will submit the application to HUD, and must delineate the responsibilities of each participating
unit of government with respect to the Small Cities Program. The lead applicant is responsible for executing the application,
certifications, and grant agreement, and ensuring compliance with all laws, regulations, and Executive Orders
applicable to the CDBG Program. HUD will deal exclusively with the lead applicant with respect to issues of program
administration and performance, including remedial actions. In the event of poor performance, HUD reserves the
right to deny and/or restrict future funding to all units of general local government which are parties to the cooperation
agreement.

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Criteria. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following criteria apply for an imminent threat to public health or safety: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Director of Community Planning and Development of the HUD office may, at any time, invite an application for
funds available under this subpart in response to a request for assistance to alleviate an imminent threat to public
health or safety that requires immediate resolution. HUD shall verify the urgency and the immediacy of the threat
with an appropriate authority other than the applicant prior to acceptance of the application, and the Director of
Community Planning and Development of the HUD Office shall review the claim to determine if, in fact, an imminent threat
to public health or safety does exist. For example, an applicant with documented cases of disease resulting from a
contaminated drinking water supply has an imminent threat to public health, while an applicant ordered to improve
the quality of its drinking water supply over the next two years does not have an imminent threat within the definition
of paragraph (a) of this section. These funds are to be used to deal with those threats which represent a unique and unusual
circumstance, not for the type of threat that occurs with frequency in a number of communities within the State of New
York. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The applicant does not have sufficient local resources, and other Federal or State resources are unavailable
to alleviate the imminent threat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) All imminent threat projects must meet the requirement of &sect;570.420(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD action. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Fifteen percent of the funds allocated to New York State in the Small Cities Program may be reserved to alleviate
imminent threats to the public health or safety unless a lesser amount is specified in a NOFA. Applications shall be
submitted in accordance with &sect;570.423. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Applications which meet the requirements of this section may be approved by the Director of Community Planning
and Development of the HUD Office without competition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The only funds reserved for imminent threats to the public health or safety are those specified by this section
as modified by the NOFA. After the funds have been depleted, HUD shall not consider further requests for grants relating
to imminent threats during that fiscal year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Letter to proceed. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding &sect;570.425(a)(3), after a determination has been made that an imminent threat exists, HUD may
issue the applicant a letter to proceed to incur costs to alleviate the imminent threat. Reimbursement of such costs
is dependent upon HUD approval of the final application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Environmental review. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 24 CFR 58.34(a)(8), grants for imminent threat to public health or safety are excluded from some or all
of the environmental review requirements of 24 CFR part 58, to the extent provided therein.

Incomplete applications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications must contain the information required by HUD. Information relative to the application will not be accepted
or considered if received after the submission deadline, unless the information is specifically requested in writing
by HUD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pre-agreement costs. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD authorizes a unit of general local government to incur costs during a Federal fiscal year in which a grant is made
or the prior fiscal year for preparation of a CDBG grant application, planning costs eligible under &sect;570.205,
environmental assessments, and project engineering and design costs for eligible activities under &sect;570.201
through 570.204 before the establishment of a formal grant relationship between the applicant and HUD. Costs of such
activities for the funded application may be charged to the grant should it be funded, provided that the activities
are undertaken in accordance with the requirements of this subpart, and 24 CFR part 58. It is understood that the incurring
of costs described in this paragraph creates no obligation on HUD to approve the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Following the review of the applications, HUD will promptly notify each applicant of the action taken with regard
to its application. Documentation which supports HUD's decisions on applications will be available to the public.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Conditional approval. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD may make a conditional approval, in which case the grant will be approved but the obligation and utilization of
funds will be restricted. The reasons for the conditional approval and the actions necessary to remove the condition
will be specified. Failure to satisfy the condition may result in a termination of the grant.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Individual grant amounts.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In determining appropriate grant amounts to be awarded, HUD may take into account the size of the applicant, the level
of demand, the scale of the activity proposed relative to need and operational capacity, the number of persons to be
served, the amount of funds required to achieve project objectives and the administrative capacity of the applicant
to complete the activities in a timely manner.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Streamlined application requirement for previous applicants.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 HUD may provide pursuant to a NOFA that if an applicant notifies HUD in writing within the application period specified
in a NOFA that it wishes to be so considered, HUD will consider unfunded applications from the prior round or competition
that meet the threshold requirements of the NOFA. For FY 1995 only, unfunded applications from the FY 1994 competition
will be automatically reactivated for consideration unless the applicant notifies the Department in writing by
the date specified in the FY 1995 NOFA that it does not wish to have the FY 1994 application considered in the FY 1995 competition.
The applicant will have the option of withdrawing its application, or amending or supplementing the application
for succeeding rounds of competition. If there is no significant change in the application involving new activities
or alteration of proposed activities that will significantly change the scope, location or objectives of the proposed
activities or beneficiaries, there will be no further citizen participation requirement to keep the application
active for succeeding rounds of competition.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) The provisions of &sect;570.504(b) apply to all program income generated by a specific grant and received prior
to grant closeout.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) If the unit of general local government has another ongoing CDBG grant at the time of closeout, the program income
will be considered to be program income of the ongoing grant. The grantee can choose which grant to credit the program
income to if it has multiple open CDBG grants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the unit of general local government has no open ongoing CDBG grant at the time of closeout, program income of
the unit of general local government or its subrecipients which amounts to less than $25,000 per year will not be considered
to be program income. When more than $25,000 of program income is generated from one or more closed out grants in a year
after closeout, the entire amount of the program income is subject to the requirements of this part. This will be a subject
of the closeout agreement described in &sect;570.509(c).

HUD approval of certain program amendments.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Grantees shall request prior HUD approval for all program amendments involving new activities or alteration of existing
activities that will significantly change the scope, location, or objectives of the approved activities or beneficiaries.
Approval is subject to the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Programs or projects that include new or significantly altered activities are rated in accordance with the criteria
for selection applicable at the time the original preapplication or application (whichever is applicable) was rated.
The rating of the program or projects proposed which include the new or altered activities proposed by the amendment
must be equal to or greater than the lowest rating received by a funded project or program during that cycle of ratings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Consideration shall be given to whether any new activity proposed can be completed promptly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the grant was received on a non-competitive basis, the proposed amended project must be able to be completed
promptly, and must meet all of the threshold requirements that were required for the original project. If the proposal
is to amend the project to a type of project that was rated competitively in the Fiscal Year that the non-competitive
project was funded, the new or altered activities proposed by the amendment must receive a rating equal to or greater
than the lowest rating received by a funded project or program during that cycle of ratings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Capacity to utilize the grant amount effectively and efficiently;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Compliance with the requirements of &sect;570.902(a) for timely expenditure of funds beginning with grants
made in FY 1996. In making this calculation, all outstanding grants will be considered. For the FY 1995 grant the requirement

Certifications.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The certifications made by the grantee will be satisfactory to the Secretary if made in conformance with the requirements
of paragraph (f) of this section, unless the Secretary has determined pursuant to subpart O of this part that the grantee
has not complied with the requirements of this part or has failed to carry out its Comprehensive Housing Affordability
Strategy in a timely manner, or determined that there is evidence, not directly involving the grantee's past performance
under this program, which tends to challenge in a substantial manner the grantee's certification of future performance.
If the Secretary makes any such determination, however, further assurances may be required to be submitted by the
grantee as the Secretary may deem warranted or necessary to find the grantee's certification satisfactory.

Conditional grant.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Secretary may make a conditional grant in which case the obligation and use of grant funds for activities may be
restricted. Conditional grants may be made where there is substantial evidence that there has been, or there will
be, a failure to meet the performance requirements or criteria described in subpart O of this part. In such case, the
conditional grant will be made by means of a grant agreement, executed by HUD, which includes the terms of the condition
specifying the reason for the conditional grant, the actions necessary to remove the condition and the deadline for
taking those actions. The grantee shall execute and return such an agreement to HUD within 60 days of the date of its
transmittal. Failure of the grantee to execute and return the grant agreement within 60 days may be deemed by HUD to
constitute rejection of the grant by the grantee and shall be cause for HUD to determine that the funds provided in the
grant agreement are available for reallocation in accordance with section 106(c) of the Act. Failure to satisfy the
condition may result in a reduction in the grant amount pursuant to &sect;570.911.

Compliance with the primary objective.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Starting with the FY 1995 grant, grantees may select a time period of one, two or three program years in which to meet
the requirement that not less than 70 percent of the aggregate of CDBG fund expenditures be for activities benefitting
low- and moderate-income persons. Grants made from allocations prior to FY 1995 will be considered individually
for meeting the primary objective, and expenditures for grants from pre FY 1995 allocations made during and after
FY 1995 will not be considered in determining whether the primary objective has been met for post 1994 allocations.
If the State of Hawaii decides to administer the Community Development Block Grant Program for non-entitled units
of general local government in Hawaii, the State will be bound by the time period for meeting the primary objective
that was chosen by each non-entitled grantee within the State until those time periods have expired.

(v) The types and levels of assistance the applicant plans to make available (or to require others to make available)
to persons displaced by CDBG-funded activities, even if the applicant expects no displacement to occur; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Providing technical assistance to groups representative of persons of low and moderate income that request assistance
in developing proposals. The level and type of assistance to be provided is at the discretion of the applicant. The
assistance need not include the provision of funds to the groups; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Holding a minimum of two public hearings, for the purpose of obtaining citizen's views and formulating or responding
to proposals and questions. Each public hearing must be conducted at a different stage of the CDBG program. Together,
the hearings must address community development and housing needs, development of proposed activities and review
of program performance. There must be reasonable notice of the hearings and the hearings must be held at times and accessible
locations convenient to potential or actual beneficiaries, with reasonable accommodations including material
in accessible formats for persons with disabilities. The applicant must specify in its plan how it will meet the requirement
for hearings at times and locations convenient to potential or actual beneficiaries;

(5) Responding to citizen complaints and grievances, including the procedures that citizens must follow when submitting
complaints and grievances. The applicant's policies and procedures must provide for timely written answers to written
complaints and grievances within 15 working days of the receipt of the complaint, where practicable; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Repayment of section 108 loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, a unit of general local government in a nonentitlement area
where the State has not elected to administer the CDBG program shall be eligible for Small Cities Grant assistance
hereunder for the sole purpose of paying any amounts due on debt obligations issued by such unit of general local government
(or its designated public agency) and guaranteed by the Secretary pursuant to section 108 of the Act (see subpart M
of this part). The award of grant assistance for such purpose shall be consistent with section 106(d)(3)(B) of the
Act, in such amount, and subject to such conditions as the Secretary may determine. Since guaranteed loan funds (as
defined in &sect;570.701) are required to be used in accordance with national and primary objective requirements,
and other applicable requirements of this part, any grant made to make payments on the debt obligations evidencing
the guaranteed loan shall be presumed to meet such requirements, unless HUD determines that the guaranteed loan funds
were not used in accordance with such requirements. Any such determination by HUD shall not prevent the making of the
grant in the amount of the payment due, but it may be grounds for HUD to take appropriate action under subpart O based
on the original noncompliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Condition of State election to administer State CDBG Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 106(d)(2)(A)(i) of the Act, a State has the right to elect, in such manner and at such time as the
Secretary may prescribe, to administer funds allocated under subpart A of this part for use in nonentitlement areas
of the State. After January 26, 1995, any State which elects to administer the allocation of CDBG funds for use in nonentitlement
areas of the State in any year must, in addition to all other requirements of this subpart, submit a pledge by the State
in accordance with section 108(d)(2) of the Act, and in a form acceptable to HUD, of any future CDBG grants it may receive
under subpart A and this subpart. Such pledge shall be for the purpose of assuring repayment of any debt obligations
(as defined in &sect;570.701), in accordance with their terms, that HUD may have guaranteed in the respective State
on behalf of any nonentitlement public entity (as defined in &sect;570.701) or its designated public agency prior
to the State's election.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The community development objectives the public entity proposes to pursue with the guaranteed loan funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The activities the public entity proposes to carry out with the guaranteed loan funds. Each activity must be described
in sufficient detail, including the specific provision of &sect;570.703 under which it is eligible and the national
objective to be met, amount of guaranteed loan funds expected to be used, and location, to allow citizens to determine
the degree to which they will be affected. The proposed application must indicate which activities are expected to
generate program income. The application must also describe where citizens may obtain additional information about
proposed activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) A description of the pledge of grants required under &sect;570.705(b)(2). In the case of applications by State-assisted
public entities, the description shall note that pledges of grants will be made by the State and by the public entity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Fulfill the applicable requirements in its citizen participation plan developed in accordance with &sect;570.704(a)(2).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the application's contents and to provide comments on the proposed application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Prepare its final application. Once the public entity has held the public hearing and published the proposed
application as required by paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, respectively, the public entity must
consider any such comments and views received and, if the public entity deems appropriate, modify the proposed application.
Upon completion, the public entity must make the final application available to the public. The final application
must describe each activity in sufficient detail to permit a clear understanding of the nature of each activity, as
well as identify the specific provision of &sect;570.703 under which it is eligible, the national objective to be
met, and the amount of guaranteed loan funds to be used. The final application must also indicate which activities
are expected to generate program income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) If an application for loan guarantee assistance is to be submitted by an entitlement public entity simultaneously
with the public entity's submission for its entitlement grant, the public entity shall include and identify in its
proposed and final statements of community development objectives and projected use of funds prepared for its annual
grant pursuant to &sect;570.301 the activities to be undertaken with the guaranteed loan funds, the national objective
to be met by each of these activities, the amount of any program income expected to be received during the program year,
and the amount of guaranteed loan funds to be used; the public entity shall also include in these statements a description
of the pledge of grants required under &sect;570.705(b)(2). In such cases the proposed and final application requirements
of paragraphs (a)(1) (i), (iii), and (iv) of this section will be deemed to have been met.

. The public entity must develop and follow a detailed citizen participation plan and make the plan public. The plan
must be completed and available before the application is submitted to HUD. The plan may be the plan required for the
CDBG program, modified to include guaranteed loan funds. The public entity is not required to hold a separate public
hearing for its CDBG program and for the guaranteed loan funds to obtain citizens' views on community development
and housing needs. The plan must set forth the public entity's policies and procedures for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

for activities that will benefit low and moderate income persons; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) The proposed activities likely to result in displacement and the public entity's plans, consistent with the policies
developed under &sect;570.606 or &sect;570.488 for minimizing displacement of persons as a result of its proposed
activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Providing technical assistance to groups representative of persons of low and moderate income that request
assistance in developing proposals. The level and type of assistance to be provided is at the discretion of the public
entity. Such assistance need not include the provision of funds to such groups. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Holding a minimum of two public hearings, each at a different stage of the public entity's program, for the purpose
of obtaining the views of citizens and formulating or responding to proposals and questions. Together the hearings
must address community development and housing needs, development of proposed activities and review of program
performance. At least one of these hearings must be held before submission of the application to obtain the views of
citizens on community development and housing needs. Reasonable notice of the hearing must be provided and the hearing
must be held at times and locations convenient to potential or actual beneficiaries, with accommodation for the handicapped.
The public entity must specify in its plan how it will meet the requirement for a hearing at times and locations convenient
to potential or actual beneficiaries.

(v) Providing affected citizens with reasonable advance notice of, and opportunity to comment on, proposed activities
not previously included in an application and activities which are proposed to be deleted or substantially changed
in terms of purpose, scope, location, or beneficiaries. The criteria the public entity will use to determine what
constitutes a substantial change for this purpose must be described in the citizen participation plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Responding to citizens' complaints and grievances, including the procedures that citizens must follow when
submitting complaints and grievances. The public entity's policies and procedures must provide for timely written

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
); and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;3619).

resources from funds provided under this subpart or program income to allow it to comply with the provisions of &sect;570.200(c)(2),

HUD review and approval of applications. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

the application together with its recommendation for approval or disapproval of the requested loan guarantee to

(3) HUD may disapprove an application, or may approve loan guarantee assistance for an amount less than requested,
for any of the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) HUD determines that the guarantee constitutes an unacceptable financial risk. Factors that will be considered

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(4) HUD will notify the public entity in writing that the loan guarantee request has either been approved, reduced
or disapproved. If the request is reduced or disapproved, the public entity shall be informed of the specific reasons
for reduction or disapproval. If the request is approved, HUD shall issue an offer of commitment to guarantee debt
obligations of the borrower identified in the application subject to compliance with this part, including the requirements
under &sect;570.705(b), (d), (g) and (h) for securing and issuing debt obligations, the conditions for release of

The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees made under this subpart. Any
such guarantee made by HUD shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the debt obligations for such guarantee
with respect to principal and interest, and the validity of such guarantee so made shall be incontestable in the hands
of a holder of the guaranteed debt obligations. If HUD pays a claim under a guarantee made under section 108 of the Act,
HUD shall be fully subrogated for all the rights of the holder of the guaranteed debt obligation with respect to such
obligation.

responsible, subject to HUD oversight under subpart I of this part, for ensuring that the public entity complies with
all applicable requirements governing the use of the guaranteed loan funds. Notwithstanding the State's responsibilities
described in this section, HUD may take any action necessary for ensuring compliance with requirements affecting
the security interests of HUD with respect to the guaranteed loan.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In carrying out its enforcement responsibilities under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, OSHA from time to
time investigates workplace incidents which involve not only injuries to workers directly exposed to hazards, but
injuries and potential injuries to employees who voluntarily attempt to rescue or assist their fellow workers. OSHA
is aware of many instances in which employees have voluntarily rescued coworkers or rendered emergency assistance
in the aftermath of workplace accidents, sometimes at considerable risk to themselves. Until recently, there has
been no written instruction by OSHA to its field offices providing guidance in such situations. Accordingly, the
agency has decided to issue an interpretive rule clarifying its citation policy regarding employers whose employees
perform or attempt to perform rescues of individuals in life-threatening danger.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is not OSHA's policy to interfere with or to regulate every decision by a worker to place himself at risk to save another
individual. Nor is it OSHA's policy to issue citations to employers whose employees voluntarily undertake acts of
heroism to save another individual from imminent harm, where rescue operations are not part of the employee's job
responsibilities and the likelihood that a rescue may become necessary is not reasonably foreseeable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, employers who have employees working in environments where the possibility of life-threatening
accidents is reasonably foreseeable are required by various OSHA standards and the general duty clause to take appropriate
precautions to assure that the rescuers themselves do not become victims. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g., Pride Oil Well Service, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15 BNA&hyph;OSHC 1808 (Rev. Comm.1992); ARO. Inc., 1 BNA&hyph;OSHC 1453 (Rev. Com. 1973). Accidents requiring rescue
efforts are reasonably foreseeable in certain working environments such as, for example, trenches and excavations,
hazardous waste operations and emergency response work, or construction work over water. Confined spaces are another
occupational setting where rescuers, without proper equipment and precautions, often are killed or injured. ``Worker
Deaths in Confined Spaces: A Summary of Surveillance Findings and Investigative Case Reports'', National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health, No. 94&hyph;103 (1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the occurrence of accidents which invite rescue attempts is foreseeable in various industrial processes
and environments, a variety of OSHA standards include precautions and safeguards for rescue-related operations,
including, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

hazardous waste operations standard, 29 CFR 1910.120(1), (p) and (q); and the standards on confined spaces in general
industry, 29 CFR 1910.146, and in grain handling, 1910.272(d), (e), and (g). In construction, specific rescue precautions
are prescribed, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the interpretive rule set forth below, these and other requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health
Act will be applied in situations involving employee rescue efforts only when the employer has specifically designated
an employee with responsibility to perform or assist in a rescue operation, or when employees have duties directly
related to workplace processes or operations where the possibility of life-threatening accidents is foreseeable.

Effect of the Interpretive Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The present interpretive rule is intended to make clear that no citation will be issued by OSHA to any employer, under
any OSHA standard or under the general duty clause, for any rescue activity by its employees except in the limited circumstances
discussed in the written policy statement to be codified in 29 CFR Part 1903. The rule is adopted as a general statement
of agency policy under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &sect;553, and is an exercise of agency prosecutorial
discretion in carrying out its enforcement responsibilities under the OSH Act. The interpretive rule issued today
is not an exercise of standard-setting authority by OSHA; it does not require any additional compliance action by
employers beyond what is already required under existing OSHA standards and the general duty clause, nor does it relieve
employers of any obligations currently imposed by those requirements, including the responsibility to designate
and appropriately train and equip emergency personnel when required under specific safety and health standards.

Regulatory Impact Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) OSHA has assessed the potential impact of this
interpretive rule. Based on the guidelines set forth in the Executive Order, OSHA has concluded that the interpretation
is not a ``significant regulatory action'' which would necessitate further economic impact evaluation and the preparation
of a regulatory impact analysis. As noted above, the interpretation does not add to the compliance responsibilities
of any employer subject to the Act; nor would the rule interfere with action by any other agency. Finally, OSHA finds
that today's interpretive rule would not have an adverse impact on small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601

 notice is both an interpretive rule and a general statement of agency policy within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and,
accordingly, is being issued as a final rule without opportunity for public comment. OSHA finds, pursuant to 29 USC
&sect;553(d), that good cause exists for making the interpretive rule effective immediately upon publication;
as discussed above, the rescue policy rule simply states OSHA's enforcement policy that citations involving employee
rescue activity will be issued only with certain criteria are met, and adds no new compliance responsibilities beyond
those already contained in existing OSHA standards.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule amends the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) to implement provisions of the Treasury, Postal Service,
and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;329, September 30, 1994). The Act
eliminates the fixed statutory ceilings on mileage reimbursement rates for advantageous use of a privately owned
vehicle (POV) on official business travel, and allows the Administrator of General Services to establish the rates
based on cost investigations. This amendment is intended to provide equitable reimbursement to a Federal employee
for advantageous use of a POV on official business travel by increasing the mileage reimbursement rates to reflect
current costs per mile of operating a POV; and by increasing the mileage reimbursement rates for use of a POV in lieu
of a Government-furnished vehicle (GFV) to reflect current costs to an agency of operating a GFV.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule amends the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) to establish increased mileage reimbursement rates for
use of a privately owned vehicle (POV) while performing official business travel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mileage reimbursement rates for advantageous use of a POV have been constrained by statute at 25 cents per mile for
a privately owned automobile (established in June 1991), 45 cents per mile for a privately owned airplane (established
in October 1980), and 20 cents per mile for a privately owned motorcycle (established in October 1980) even though
cost studies have indicated that higher reimbursement rates were necessary to adequately reimburse the cost of operating
a POV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 634 of the Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Pub.
L. 103&hyph;329, September 30, 1994) eliminated the fixed statutory caps and allows the Administrator of General
Services to establish mileage reimbursement rates based on cost investigations which the General Services Administration
(GSA) is required under 5 U.S.C. 5707(b)(1) to periodically conduct and report to Congress. Under the new law, the
mileage reimbursement rate for advantageous use of a privately owned automobile may not exceed the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) business standard mileage rate in any year the IRS establishes such a single rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSA has reported the results of its November 1994 cost investigation to Congress and indicated that the governing
regulation would be revised to increase the mileage allowance for advantageous use of a privately owned automobile
from 25 cents per mile to 30 cents per mile, for use of a privately owned airplane from 45 cents per mile to 88.5 cents per
mile, and for use of a privately owned motorcycle from 20 cents per mile to 24.5 cents per mile. Additionally, based
on updated data reflecting current costs to an agency of operating a GFV, GSA has increased the two-tiered reimbursement
rates for use of a POV instead of a GFV from 18 cents to 23.5 cents per mile and from 9.5 cents to 10.5 cents per mile.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSA has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866
of September 30, 1993. This final rule is not required to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On May 16, 1994, Heli-Dyne Systems, Inc., Hurst, Texas, applied for a Supplemental Type Certificate for installation
of an Electronic Flight Instrument System in the Bell Helicopter Textron (BHTI) Model 222U helicopter. This model
helicopter is a 10 passenger, 2 engine, 8,250 pound (Category B) or 7,850 pound (Category A) transport category helicopter.

Type Certification Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The certification basis established for the BHTI Model 22U helicopter includes: 14 CFR 21.29 and part 29 of the Federal
Aviation Regulations (FAR) effective February 1, 1965 (Transport Categories A and B), Amendments 29&hyph;1 through
29&hyph;9; Amendment 29&hyph;11; &sect;29.997 of Amendment 29&hyph;10; &sect;29.927(b)(2) of Amendment 29&hyph;17;
&sect;&sect;29.801, 29.25(c) 29.865, 29.1557(c), and 29.1555(c) of Amendment 29.12; &sect;&sect;29.1, 29.79,
29.1517, and 29.1587 of Amendment 29&hyph;21; Criteria for Helicopter Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) certification
dated December 15, 1978; Exemption No. 2789, &sect;29.811(h)(1) (following Amendment 24, effective December 6,
1984, &sect;29.811(h)(1) became &sect;29.811(f)(2)); and Exemption No. 4395, &sect;29.855(a) and portions of
&sect;29.855(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Administration finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate
safety standards for these helicopters because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed
under the provisions of &sect;21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with &sect;11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as
required by &sect;&sect;11.28 and 11.29(b), and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with &sect;21.101(b)(2).

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The BHTI Model 222U helicopter, at the time of the application for modification by Heli-Dyne Systems, Inc., was identified
as incorporating one and possibly more electrical, electronic, or combination of electrical and electronic (electrical/electronic)
systems that will perform functions critical to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters. The electronic
flight instrument system performs the attitude display function. The display of attitude, altitude, and airspeed
is critical to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters for IFR operations in instrument meteorological
conditions. After the design is finalized, Heli-Dyne Systems, Inc., will provide the FAA with a preliminary hazard
that will identify any other critical functions performed by the electrical/electronic systems that are critical
to the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recent advances in technology have prompted the design of aircraft that include advanced electrical and electronic
systems that perform functions required for continued safe flight and landing. However, these advanced systems
respond to the transient effects of induced electrical current and voltage caused by the high intensity radiated
fields (HIRF) incident on the external surface of the helicopters. These induced transient currents and voltages
can degrade the performance of the electrical/electronic systems by damaging the components or by upsetting the
systems' functions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the electromagnetic environment has undergone a transformation not envisioned by the current application
of &sect;29.1309(a). Higher energy levels radiate from operational transmitters currently used for radar, radio,
and television; the number of transmitters has increased significantly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing aircraft certification requirements are inappropriate in view of these technological advances. In addition,
the FAA has received reports of some significant safety incidents and accidents involving military aircraft equipped
with advanced electrical/electronic systems when they were exposed to electromagnetic radiation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The combined effects of technological advances in helicopter design and the changing environment have resulted
in an increased level of vulnerability of the electrical and electronic systems required for the continued safe flight
and landing of the helicopters. Effective measures to protect these helicopters against the adverse effects of exposure
of HIRF will be provided by the design and installation of these systems. The following primary factors contributed
to the current conditions: (1) Increased use of sensitive electronics that perform critical functions, (2) reduced
electromagnetic shielding afforded helicopter systems by advanced technology airframe materials, (3) adverse
service experience of military aircraft using these technologies, and (4) an increase in the number and power of radio
frequency emitters and the expected increase in the future.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA recognizes the need for aircraft certification standards to keep pace with technological developments and
a changing environment and, in 1986, initiated a high priority program to (1) determine and define electromagnetic
energy levels; (2) develop guidance material for design, test, and analysis; and (3) prescribe and promulgate regulatory
standards. The FAA participated with industry and airworthiness authorities of other countries to develop internationally
recognized standards for certification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA and airworthiness authorities of other countries have identified a level of HIRF environment that a helicopter
could be exposed to during IFR operations. While the HIRF requirements are being finalized, the FAA is adopting a special
condition for the certification of aircraft that employ electrical/electronic systems that perform critical functions.
The accepted maximum energy levels that civilian helicopter system installations must withstand for safe operation
are based on surveys and analysis of existing radio frequency emitters. This special condition will require the helicopters'
electrical/electronic systems and associated wiring to be protected from these energy levels. These external threat
levels are believed to represent the worst-case exposure for a helicopter operating under IFR.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The HIRF environment specified in this proposed special condition is based on many critical assumptions. With the
exception of takeoff and landing at an airport, one of these assumptions is the aircraft would be not less than 500 feet
above ground level (AGL). Helicopters operating under visual flight rules (VFR) routinely operate at less than 500
feet AGL and perform takeoffs and landings at locations other than controlled airports. Therefore, it would be expected
that the HIRF environment experienced by a helicopter operating VFR may exceed the defined environment by 100 percent
or more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This special condition will require the systems that perform critical functions, as installed in the aircraft, to
meet certain standards based on either a defined HIRF environment or a fixed value using laboratory tests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant may demonstrate that the operation and operational capability of the installed electrical/electronic
systems that perform critical functions are not adversely affected when the aircraft is exposed to the defined HIRF
environment. The FAA has determined that the environment defined in Table 1 is acceptable for critical functions
in helicopters operating at or above 500 feet AGL. For critical functions of helicopters operating at less than 500
feet AGL, additional factors must be considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant may also demonstrate by a laboratory test that the electrical/electronic systems that perform critical
functions can withstand a peak electromagnetic field strength in a frequency range of 10 KH
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
Z
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to 18 GH
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If a laboratory test is used to show compliance with the defined HIRF environment, no credit will be given for signal
attenuation due to installation. A level of 100 v/m and other considerations, such as an alternate technology backup
that is immune to HIRF, are appropriate for critical functions during IFR operations. A level of 200 v/m and further
considerations, such as an alternate technology backup that is immune to HIRF, are more appropriate for critical
functions during VFR operations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants must perform a preliminary hazard analysis to identify electrical/electronic systems that perform
critical functions. The term ``critical'' means those functions whose failure would contribute to or cause a failure
condition that would prevent the continued safe flight and landing of the helicopters. The systems identified by
the hazard analysis as performing critical functions are required to have HIRF protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A system may perform both critical and noncritical functions. Primary electronic flight display systems and their
associated components perform critical functions such as attitude, altitude, and airspeed indications. HIRF requirements
would apply only to the systems that perform critical functions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance with HIRF requirements will be demonstrated by tests, analysis, models, similarity with existing systems,
or a combination of these methods. The two basic options of either testing the rotorcraft to the defined environment
or laboratory testing may not be combined. The laboratory test allows some frequency areas to be under tested and requires
other areas to have some safety margin when compared to the defined environment. The areas required to have some safety
margin are those that have been, by past testing, shown to exhibit greater susceptibility to adverse effects from
HIRF; and laboratory tests, in general, do not accurately represent the aircraft installation. Service experience
alone will not be acceptable since such experience in normal flight operations may not include an exposure to HIRF.
Reliance on a system with similar design features for redundancy, as a means of protection against the effects of external
HIRF, is generally insufficient because all elements of a redundant system are likely to be concurrently exposed
to the radiated fields.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modulation that represents the signal most likely to disrupt the operation of the system under test, based on its
design characteristics, should be selected. For example, flight control systems may be susceptible to 3 H
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
Z
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 square wave modulation while the video signals for electronic display systems may be susceptible to 400 H
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sinusoidal modulation. If the worst-case modulation is unknown or cannot be determined, default modulations may
be used. Suggested default values are a 1 KH

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For frequencies where the unmodulated signal would cause deviations from normal operation, several different
modulating signals with various waveforms and frequencies should be applied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acceptable system performance would be attained by demonstrating that the critical function components of the system
under consideration continue to perform their intended function during and after exposure to required electromagnetic
fields. Deviations from system specifications may be acceptable but must be independently assessed by the FAA on
a case-by-case basis.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model
A320 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS).
This proposal is prompted by a report of leakage from some of the hydraulic pipe fittings after a lightning strike.
The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent such leakage from hydraulic pipe fittings, which
could result in the loss of the pilot's ability to control the moveable surfaces of the THS.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A320 series airplanes. The DGAC
advises that one operator found leakage from some of the hydraulic pipe fittings on one airplane after a lightning
strike. Investigation revealed that the electrical bonding of the hydraulic pipe fittings and actuator servo control
units of the trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) has insufficient protection from a lightning strike. This condition,
if not corrected, could result in the loss of the pilot's ability to control the moveable surfaces of the THS, which
could adversely affect the controllability of the airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;29&hyph;1058, dated July 16, 1993, which describes procedures for
modification of the THS. This modification involves installing bonding leads across all return hydraulic pipe fittings
in the THS area and across the actuator return line elbows. This modification also involves replacing the existing
clamps with items of increased electrical conductivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus has also issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;27&hyph;1041, Revision 2, dated April 20, 1994, which describes
procedures for modification of the THS. This modification involves installing bonding plates and leads between
the elevator and the THS, and bonding leads between the actuator bodies and the THS bonding strip. This modification
also connects bonding leads to the return hydraulic pipes across all the fittings in the THS area.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accomplishment of both of these modifications will improve the electrical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bonding protection on the THS. The DGAC classified these service bulletins as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory and issued French AD 93&hyph;123&hyph;046 (B), dated August 4, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness
of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29)
and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the
DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed
all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated
for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the THS. The actions would be
required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 99 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
13 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts would be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $77,220, or $780 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

 This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has
been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been
modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator
must use the authority provided in paragraph (b) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either
no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Model
A320&hyph;111, &hyph;211, and &hyph;212 series airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the junction
box and connector backshells of a certain electrical harness assembly. This proposal is prompted by a report that
traces of fungus and corrosion have been found on the electrical harness junction box of the thrust reverser. The actions
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent such corrosion, which could result in multiple faults in the thrust
reverser position indication, and subsequent uncontrolled reduction of engine power.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France,
recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Airbus Model A320&hyph;111, &hyph;211, and
&hyph;212 series airplanes powered by CFM 56&hyph;5A engines equipped with an electrical harness assembly having
part number (P/N) 238W0908&hyph;513. The DGAC advises it has received a report indicating that traces of fungus and
corrosion have been found on the electrical harness junction box (transition box) of the thrust reverser. Investigation
revealed that moisture ingressed into the electrical harness junction box and associated wiring. The effects of
such moisture subsequently could corrode the electrical harness junction box. This condition, if not detected and
corrected in a timely manner, could result in multiple faults in the thrust reverser position indication, and subsequent
uncontrolled reduction of engine power. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus has issued Service Bulletin A320&hyph;71&hyph;1011, dated November 17, 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which describes procedures for modification of the junction box and connector backshells of the electrical harness
assembly having P/N 238W0908&hyph;513. This modification involves sealing the junction box, replacing the existing
aluminum backshells with stainless steel backshells, and checking the insulation of the electrical harness. The
DGAC classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued French AD 94&hyph;030&hyph;050(B), dated February
2, 1994, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in France. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29)
and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the
DGAC has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the DGAC, reviewed
all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated
for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the junction box and connector
backshells of the electrical harness assembly of the thrust reverser. The actions would be required to be accomplished
in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each AD that provides
for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 50 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
24 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts would be supplied by ROHR, Inc. (the manufacturer of the junction box, connector backshells, and the
electrical harness assembly) at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $72,000, or $1,440 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model
F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. This proposal would require replacement of the flight control lock (FCL) handle and
switch with a modified unit. This proposal is prompted by a report of sudden engagement of the FCL system during approach
for landing. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent inadvertent engagement of the FCL system
during flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that
it received a report that the autothrottle system on a Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplane disengaged suddenly while
the airplane was on approach for landing. The thrust levers could not be moved, and the ailerons were blocked in the
``NEUTRAL'' position. After recycling the flight control lock (FCL) system to the ``UNLOCKED'' and ``LATCHED''
position, the thrust levers and ailerons were free to move again. The thrust levers are linked to the FCL system to prevent
takeoff revolutions per minute (RPM) from being selected if the FCL system is locked.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation revealed that a takeoff configuration warning for the FCL system may not be generated, despite the
fact that the FCL handle is not in the ``UNLOCKED'' and ``LATCHED'' position. On some aircraft, the operating forces
then may be insufficient to drive the handle back into the ``UNLOCKED'' and ``LATCHED'' position, and the flight control
surface could lock unexpectedly during flight. This condition, if not corrected, could result in inadvertent engagement
of the FCL and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;27&hyph;051, Revision 1, dated May 6, 1994, which describes procedures
for replacement of the FCL handle and switch with a modified unit. Accomplishment of this installation will ensure
that a takeoff configuration warning for the FCL system is generated if the handle is not latched in the ``UNLOCKED''
position. The RLD classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Netherlands airworthiness directive
BLA No. 93&hyph;088 (A), dated July 12, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in
the Netherlands.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require replacement of the FCL handle and switch with
a modified unit. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described
previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 75 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
3 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required
parts would cost approximately $1,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $88,500, or $1,180 per airplane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The amendments would update the disciplinary background provisions of the form to reflect amendments to the federal
securities laws, and would provide the financial institutions of the associated persons and the appropriate regulatory
authorities for the financial institutions with more useful information.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department adopted Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 (Disclosure Form for Person Associated with a Financial Institution
Government Securities Broker or Dealer) in the implementing regulations for the GSA issued on July 24, 1987 (52 FR
27910). Sections 400.4 and 449.3
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 of the GSA regulations require the form to be used by associated persons of financial institutions that are government
securities brokers and dealers to provide the financial institution and the appropriate regulatory agency with
certain information concerning employment, residence and statutory disqualification. Under the GSA regulations,
associated persons that have a current Form U&hyph;4 (Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration
or Transfer) or Form MSD&hyph;4 (Uniform Application for Municipal Securities Principal or Municipal Securities
Representative Associated with a Bank Municipal Securities Dealer) on file with their financial institution are
not required to file Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4. Associated persons are not required to file G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 forms
with their financial institutions that are exempt from filing notice as government securities brokers or dealers
pursuant to part 401 of the GSA regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed changes to the body of Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 relate to Item 17, which requests information concerning
the disciplinary history of the associated person. The changes are being made to reflect amendments to the Exchange
Act by the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990 (``Remedies Act'')
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and the International Securities Enforcement Cooperation Act of 1990 (``ISECA'').
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Remedies Act gave the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') the authority to seek civil monetary penalties
in court proceedings and to impose monetary penalties and order disgorgement in administrative proceedings. The
Remedies Act also provided the SEC with both temporary and permanent cease and desist order authority to prevent violations
of securities laws. The ISECA gave the SEC the authority to bar, suspend or restrict the activities of broker-dealers
and the associated persons or those persons seeking to become associated with a broker-dealer, based upon the findings
of a foreign court or foreign securities authority. By amending the GSA, the ISECA also gave similar authority to the
appropriate regulatory agencies for financial institutions that are government securities brokers or dealers
regarding associated persons or those persons seeking to become associated with such entities.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The ISECA added a definition of the term ``foreign financial regulatory authority'' to section 3(a) of the Exchange
Act,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 and provided that certain types of actions taken by foreign financial regulatory authorities will be deemed a statutory
disqualification.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically, the amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 would amend question C of Item 17 to add paragraph (5), which
would ask the associated person whether the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') has ever imposed
a civil money penalty on the associated person, or ordered the associated person to cease and desist from any activity.
The new inquiry would require a yes or no response, and if the response is yes, details must be provided, as is currently
required for any affirmative response in Item 17. The disclosure of this additional information would correspond
to the SEC's expanded administrative and civil enforcement authorities under the Remedies Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 would also add a definition of ``foreign financial regulatory authority''
to Item 17, and would add this term to question 17.D. Thus, question 17.D would now inquire whether any federal regulatory
agency, any state regulatory agency or ``foreign financial regulatory authority'' has ever found the associated
person to have: made a false statement or omission or been dishonest, unfair or unethical; been involved in a violation
of investment regulations or statutes; been the cause of an investment-related business having its authorization
to do business denied, suspended, revoked or restricted; been subject to an order concerning investment-related
activity; had its registration or license denied, suspended, or revoked, or otherwise been prevented from associating
with an investment-related business, or been disciplined by the restriction of its activities; or had its license
as an attorney, accountant or federal contractor suspended. The definition of ``foreign financial regulatory authority''
which would be added to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 is essentially the definition the ISECA added to section 3(a)(52)
of the Exchange Act. Questions 17.A and 17.B would be amended to clarify that the inquiries now apply to information
related to foreign as well as domestic courts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments would modify Item 5 to reflect the Office of Thrift Supervision as the successor to the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board. Thus, the ``Director, Office of Thrift Supervision'' would now be listed as one of the appropriate
regulatory agencies with which the financial institutions may be required to file the form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the technical changes made by the Government Securities Act Amendments of 1993 to the definition of ``appropriate
regulatory agency'',
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 these amendments would also make corresponding changes to Item 3 of the general instructions for Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These amendments would ensure that Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 will provide a more complete description of the associated
person's disciplinary history. The amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 would also conform to similar changes
made by the National Association of Securities Dealers (``NASD'') to Form U&hyph;4 in November, 1991,
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 and by the SEC to Form BD (Uniform Application for Broker-Dealer Registration) in July, 1992.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The Treasury was unable to propose amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 at the same time the NASD and SEC made changes
to their respective forms since its rulemaking authority under the GSA expired on October 1, 1991, and was not reauthorized
until December 17, 1993.

If the Department adopts the amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 as proposed, associated persons of financial
institutions that are government securities brokers or dealers would need to file amendments to their existing Form
G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 to the extent that any information is inaccurate or incomplete. Associated persons would need
to review their current Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 filings to determine whether the forms contain all the information
required by these amendments, and if not, the associated person would need to file an amendment to their G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4
with the updated information. An appropriate transition period would be provided for associated persons to file
any required updates.

II. Special Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the very limited impact of the proposed amendments, it is the Department's view that the proposed changes
to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 are not a ``significant regulatory action'' for the purposes of Executive Order 12866.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), it is hereby certified that the amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4, if adopted, will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities and, as a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The collection of information in these proposed amendments to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 is contained in revised Items
5 and 17 of the form. Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 is required to be submitted by associated persons of financial institutions
that are government securities brokers and dealers, in accordance with &sect;&sect;400.4 and 449.3. The collection
of information is intended to give the financial institutions and the appropriate regulatory authorities of the
financial institutions a more complete and meaningful description of the disciplinary history of the associated
person. The rule applies only to associated persons of financial institutions that are not exempt from filing notice
as government securities brokers and dealers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Department is proposing to add a new paragraph to an existing question and modify several other questions
on Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4, and cannot be certain as to the exact impact on associated persons completing the form,
it does believe that the changes will not have more than a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 effect on the amount of time necessary to complete the form. The Department's most recent Paperwork Reduction Act
Filing with respect to Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 shows an annual estimate of 800 respondents filing once per year, with
a burden of two hours per respondent. No modification is projected to the reporting burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) requires that collections of information prescribed in proposed
rules be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and approval. Since these proposed amendments
result in no increase in burden hours to complete Form G&hyph;FIN&hyph;4 and more importantly do not represent any
program change, the submission described in the Paperwork Reduction Act is inapplicable.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed regulations relate to the amount of gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from a conversion transaction position that is subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recharacterization as ordinary income. The proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide that certain gains and losses from positions of the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion transaction may be netted for purposes of determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of gain that is recharacterized as ordinary income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed regulations reflect changes to the law made by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 and affect persons who enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into conversion transactions.

whether the taxpayer has elected to net losses against gains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before applying section 1258(a) and to verify that the taxpayer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is properly reporting its conversion transactions that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to netting. The likely recordkeepers are business or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other for-profit institutions and nonprofit institutions.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 1258(a) of the Internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Revenue Code of 1986. Section 1258 was added to the Code by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 13206(a) of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1258 treats certain capital gains from conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transactions as ordinary income. A transaction is a conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction if substantially all of the taxpayer's expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
return is attributable to the time value of the taxpayer's net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investment in the transaction and the transaction falls within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one of four categories. The four categories of covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transactions are (1) acquiring property and substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contemporaneously entering into a contract to sell that (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially identical) property, (2) applicable straddles, (3) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transactions marketed or sold as producing capital gains, and (4) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transactions specified in regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gain generated by any position of a conversion transaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is treated as ordinary income to the extent of the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imputed income amount (AIIA). The AIIA is equal to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer's net investment in the transaction multiplied by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable rate, with certain adjustments. The applicable rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is generally 120 percent of the applicable Federal rate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined as if the conversion transaction were a debt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrument.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of section 1258 is to treat the time value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income from conversion transactions as ordinary income. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1258(a) may create a character mismatch, however, because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focuses only on the gain recognized on the transaction. If a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer separately disposes of the positions of a conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction, the taxpayer's inability to net losses on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positions against gains could result in the recharacterization of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gain in excess of the time value element. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, assume that a taxpayer buys a capital asset for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$100 and simultaneously sells that asset forward for $105 in one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. Assume that the AIIA is $8. If the asset were delivered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to close out the forward contract, the taxpayer would have a $5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital gain. Even though the AIIA is $8, no more than the $5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gain would be recharacterized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assume, instead, that the taxpayer sells the asset and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
closes out the forward contract in separate transactions when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value of the asset has dropped to $97. Gain subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recharacterization under section 1258(a), determined separately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each position, is $8 on the forward contract. If the $3 loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the asset were not netted against that $8 gain prior to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying section 1258(a), the full $8 gain would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recharacterized as ordinary income. This recharacterization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would force the taxpayer to recognize $8 of ordinary income and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$3 of non-offsetting capital loss. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations provide relief from this potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
character mismatch in certain circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Specific Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations allow taxpayers to net gains and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses on the positions of certain conversion transactions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of section 1258(a). To be eligible, the taxpayer must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify, before the close of the day on which the positions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become part of the conversion transaction, all the positions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are part of the conversion transaction. In addition, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayer must dispose of all the positions within a 14-day period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is within a single taxable year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulations also provide special rules for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
losses on positions of conversion transactions. These rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent the netting of built-in loss against gain. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the rules treat certain losses that arise during the term of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion transaction as built-in losses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These regulations are proposed to be effective for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion transactions entered into on or after the date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filing of the final regulations with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Solicitation of Comments on Other Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The scope of the relief provided by the proposed regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be broadened if a taxpayer could elect to treat retained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positions of a conversion transaction as if they were sold for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their fair market values whenever another position of that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction was disposed of, terminated, or treated as sold under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any other provision of the Code or regulations. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations do not include such a mark-to-market provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marking positions to market raises a number of issues under other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the Code (for example, sections 1271 through 1278). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service solicits comments on the necessity for and terms of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mark-to-market provision under section 1258. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is aware that section 1258 presents a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues not addressed by the proposed regulations. The Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
invites comments concerning which, if any, of these issues should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be addressed in future regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration for comment on its impact on small business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments and Public Hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before these proposed regulations are adopted as final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a signed original and eight (8) copies) that are submitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely to the IRS. All comments will be available for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection and copying.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this section is to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxpayers with a method to net certain gains and losses from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positions of the same conversion transaction before determining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the amount of gain treated as ordinary income under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1258(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Netting of gain and loss for identified transactions_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a taxpayer disposes of or terminates all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positions of an identified netting transaction (as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(2) of this section) within a 14-day period in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single taxable year, all gains and losses on those positions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realized within that period (other than built-in losses as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in paragraph (c) of this section) are netted solely for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of determining the amount of gain treated as ordinary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
income under section 1258(a). A taxpayer is treated as disposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of any position that is treated as sold under any provision of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Code or regulations thereunder (for example, under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1256(a)(1)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Identified netting transaction. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, an identified netting transaction is a conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction (as defined in section 1258(c)) that the taxpayer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifies as an identified netting transaction on its books and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records. Identification of each position of the conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction must be made before the close of the day on which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position becomes part of the conversion transaction. No 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular form of identification is necessary, but all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positions of a single conversion transaction must be identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as part of the same transaction and must be distinguished from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all other positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Definition of built-in loss. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For purposes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, built-in loss can arise in two situations. First, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built-in loss as defined in section 1258(d)(3)(B) is built-in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss. Second, if a taxpayer realizes gain or loss on any one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
position of a conversion transaction (for example, under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1256) and, as of the date that gain or loss is realized, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unrealized loss in any other position of the conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction that is not disposed of, terminated, or treated as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sold under any provision of the Code or regulations thereunder 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 14 days of and within the same taxable year as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realization event, that unrealized loss is built-in loss. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Examples. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These examples illustrate this section:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1. Identified netting transaction with simultaneous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actual dispositions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) On December 1, 1995, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 purchases 1,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shares of XYZ stock for $100,000 and enters into a forward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract to sell 1,000 shares of XYZ stock on November 30, 1997, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for $110,000. The XYZ stock is actively traded as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1.1092(d)-1(a) and is a capital asset in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
's hands. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintains books and records on which, on December 1, 1995, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifies the two positions as all the positions of a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion transaction. A owns no other XYZ stock. On December 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1, 1996, when the applicable imputed income amount for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction is $7,000, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 sells the 1,000 shares of XYZ stock for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$95,000. On the same day, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 terminates its forward contract by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entering into an offsetting position, receiving $10,200. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The XYZ stock and forward contract are positions of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion transaction. Under section 1258(c)(1), substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of A's expected return from the overall transaction is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to the time value of the net investment in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction. Under section 1258(c)(2)(B), the transaction is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable straddle as defined in section 1258(d)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 disposed of or terminated all the positions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion transaction within 14 days and within the same taxable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year as required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction is an identified netting transaction because it meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the identification requirement of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section. Solely for purposes of section 1258(a), the $5,000 loss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realized ($100,000 basis less $95,000 amount realized) on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposition of the XYZ stock is netted against the $10,200 gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognized on the disposition of the forward contract. Thus, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
net gain from the conversion transaction for purposes of section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1258(a) is $5,200 ($10,200 gain less $5,000 loss). Only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$5,200 net gain is recharacterized as ordinary income under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1258(a) even though the applicable imputed income amount 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is $7,000. For federal tax purposes other than section 1258(a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 has recognized a $10,200 gain on the disposition of the forward 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract ($5,200 of which is treated as ordinary income) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realized a separate $5,000 loss on the sale of the XYZ stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 2. Identified netting transaction with built-in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loss. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The facts are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, except that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
had purchased the XYZ stock for $104,000 on May 15, 1995. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
XYZ stock had a fair market value of $100,000 on December 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1995, the date it became part of a conversion transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The results are the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, except that A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has built-in loss (in addition to the $5,000 loss that arose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economically during the period of the conversion transaction), as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in section 1258(d)(3)(B), of $4,000 on the XYZ stock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That $4,000 built-in loss is not netted against the $10,200 gain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the forward contract for purposes of section 1258(a). Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the net gain from the conversion transaction for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1258(a) is $5,200, the same as in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
. The $4,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built-in loss is recognized and has a character determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without regard to section 1258. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Example 3. Identified netting transaction with position 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marked to market. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
, a calendar year taxpayer, holds a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portfolio of Treasury securities that are capital assets in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hands. On December 1, 1995, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 enters into a short futures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract on Treasury securities that is a regulated futures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contract (RFC) as defined in section 1256(g)(1). Although the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RFC and some portion of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
's portfolio of Treasury securities (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion Treasuries) constitute a straddle as defined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1092(c), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 does not make an election under section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1256(d) to have section 1256 not apply to the RFC, nor does 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make any identification or election under &sect;1.1092(b)&hyph;3T or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;1.1092(b)&hyph;4T (relating to certain identified mixed straddles or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mixed straddle accounts, respectively). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 maintains books and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records on which, on December 1, 1995, it identifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion Treasuries and the RFC as all the positions of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single conversion transaction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) As of December 29, 1995, the last business day of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taxable year, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 has an unrealized loss on the conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasuries of $8,000, wholly attributable to the period beginning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 1, 1995, and ending December 29, 1995, and an unrealized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gain on the RFC of $8,800. Under section 1256, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 marks the RFC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to market as of December 29, 1995. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 continues to hold the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion Treasuries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The conversion Treasuries and RFC are positions of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conversion transaction. Under section 1258(c)(1), substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
's expected return from the overall transaction is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to the time value of the net investment in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transaction. Under section 1258(c)(2)(B), the transaction is an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable straddle as defined in section 1258(d)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The transaction is an identified netting transaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because it meets the identification requirement of paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)(2) of this section. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to the transaction, however, because 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 did not dispose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of or terminate all the positions of the conversion transaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the same 14-day period in the same taxable year. There 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has been no disposition or termination of the conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasuries by December 31, 1995, the end of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
's taxable year in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which it is treated as having sold the RFC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The $8,000 excess of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
's basis in the conversion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treasuries over their fair market value on December 29, 1995, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
built-in loss under paragraph (c) of this section. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that $8,000 built-in loss is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not available to offset later gain on the positions.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
By notice published on November 18, 1994 (59 FR 59744), FRA scheduled a public regulatory conference for January 9&hyph;13,
1995, at the Executive Inn in Sacramento, California, to allow interested parties the opportunity to further discuss
issues related to its notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on railroad accident reporting. The location for this

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) History and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Following publication of the NPRM on accident reporting in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 42880), FRA conducted a series of public hearings to obtain the industry's views and comments on specific issues
addressed in the NPRM. Public hearings were held in Washington, D.C. on October 5&hyph;6; in Kansas City, Missouri
on October 19; and in Portland, Oregon on November 3. FRA examined the issues and interests involved and made a preliminary
inquiry among the hearing participants to determine whether additional hearings or regulatory meetings could be
successful in narrowing areas of disagreement and exploring possible accommodations. Most participants expressed
interest in continuing the rulemaking process by holding additional or supplementary regulatory meetings, roundtables
or workshops. After further deliberation, FRA decided that an informal public regulatory conference would prove
advantageous in the development of the accident reporting regulations. FRA also believes that the quality of the
agency's final rule will be improved by facilitating an exchange of ideas that may lead to solutions acceptable to
all interested groups.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
(II) Methodology
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the public regulatory conference is a continuation of the accident reporting rulemaking proceeding. A court reporter
will take a verbatim transcript of the conference which will be placed in the public docket for this rulemaking. The
format of the discussions will be informal and will employ a topical, interactive approach. The public regulatory
conference is currently scheduled for one week. FRA believes the time allotted for this conference will prove more
than adequate. Of course, the conference will conclude earlier than initially planned if a majority of participants
in attendance agree that the key issues have been adequately addressed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
(III) Participants
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA invites all affected parties, including small entities, to participate in the public regulatory conference.
FRA believes that extensive comment from all interested parties is necessary to develop the most effective and reasonable
final regulation. For this conference to be successful, participants should come prepared to discuss, at a minimum,
the key issues identified below and to suggest reasonable alternatives to the various proposals in the NPRM. FRA also
encourages participants to bring supporting documentation where appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
(IV) Key Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of issues were raised in the written comments received to date and at the public hearings. We encourage interested
parties to come prepared to respond to the following questions and to make any other comments or suggestions regarding
the issues presented. Please note that the conference is not limited to these issues. FRA does retain the authority,
however, to limit the issues discussed at the regulatory conference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Internal Control Plans (Proposed Section 225.33)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation proposed by FRA would require railroads to maintain written internal control plans for the preparation
of reports required under part 225. Most railroad commenters believe the internal control plan in proposed &sect;225.33
is burdensome and recommend that a performance standard of 99-percent be established to replace the internal control
plan. Dividing the number of reported accidents or incidents by the number of actual reportable accidents or incidents
would yield a number (percentage) that would then be compared against the 99-percent performance level to determine
actual performance by the railroad.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Would a performance standard system, in lieu of the proposed internal control plan, ensure FRA receives reliable
and consistent reporting data?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) How should FRA address accountability and enforceability if the carrier does not meet the 99-percent standard?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If a performance standard were adopted by FRA, penalties might be assessed based upon actual performance by the
railroad. Such a penalty would increase geometrically for each percentage point below the 99-percent performance
level, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
$1,000 penalty assessment for performance at the 98-percent level; $3,000 penalty assessment for performance at
the 97-percent level; $9,000 penalty assessment for performance at the 96-percent level, etc. Please comment on
this sliding-scale approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) FRA has determined that a 100-percent verification of reporting for a major railroad is not practicable given
the size of its current work force. Even 100-percent verification at a small facility might not be feasible. What is
the minimum sample size that would be required before a performance standard should be applied?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Association of American Railroads (AAR) acknowledged and agreed that most of its members already have internal
control plans in place. Please describe these plans in detail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If FRA determines that a written internal control plan is in fact necessary, how would you modify the existing proposal?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Should the regulation indicate that the internal control plan be continuously updated and maintained?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Magnetic Media Submissions (Proposed Section 225.37)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule allows railroads the option of reporting data by way of magnetic media in lieu of paper forms. Please
refer to proposed &sect;225.37.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Would substitute forms be acceptable for verification when a railroad submits magnetic media?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) What would be the railroad cost differentials for developing a new computer format or modifying an existing one?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Should ``railroad-designed formats'' for the various reporting forms be allowed? How would this be accomplished?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Definitions (Proposed Section 225.5)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed several new definitions in &sect;225.5. Those new definitions warranting further discussion are listed
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. ``Worker on Duty''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed that a ``worker on duty'' be defined to include individuals who receive monetary compensation from the
reporting railroad, or who are engaged in either (1) the operation of on-track equipment or (2) any other rail safety-sensitive
function for reporting railroad as described in &sect;209.303.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, a ``volunteer'' would be sort of service for the reporting railroad without receiving direct monetary
compensation from that railroad and are not engaged in either (1) the operation of on-track equipment or (2) any other
rail safety-sensitive function for the reporting railroad as described in &sect;209.303.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Should ``contractors'' and ``volunteers'' in safety-sensitive positions be reported separately from ``workers
on duty''?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should a separate classification for ``employees'' remain?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) A ``contractor'' is currently a separate classification for reporting purposes. If FRA should decide to delete
the proposed ``worker on duty'' classification, should ``volunteer'' be added as a separate classification?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) How would ``hours worked'' be calculated for contractors and volunteers involved in safety-sensitive functions?
Should these hours be listed separately?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. ``Establishment'' and ``Posted''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed in the NPRM, an ``establishment'' would be defined as a single physical location where business is conducted
or where services or operations are performed, for example, an operating division, general office, and major installation,
such as a locomotive or care repair or construction facility. FRA also proposed in &sect;225.25(e) that each railroad
``post'' a listing of all reported injuries and illnesses for the previous month at each ``establishment.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) If FRA determines that the proposed ``posting'' requirement is in fact necessary, how would you redefine ``establishment''
such that any burden to the railroad is minimized?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should each railroad be required to identify a ``recordkeeping establishment''?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Should the proposed list of definitions include one for ``posted''? Should that definition encompass ``electronic
posting,'' wherein railroad workers may view accident and injury logs via computer? Where computers are not available
at establishments, manual posting would remain a requirement. Please comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. ``Qualified Health Care Professional'' and ``Medical Treatment''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, a ``qualified health care professional'' is defined as a health care professional operating within
the scope of his or her license, registration, or certification. For example, an otolaryngologist is qualified to
diagnose a case of noise-induced hearing loss and to identify potential causal factors, but may not be qualified to
diagnose a case of silicosis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Should the definition be narrowed so as to include only people with a medical degree, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 an M.D.? Should the definition be expanded to include additional individuals (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 physical therapists) as qualified health care professionals?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should a railroad's employee assistance officer (EAP) be considered a ``qualified health care professional''
when he or she provides counseling to an employee who has experienced traumatic stress from involvement in a serious
or fatal accident?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed, ``medical treatment'' would include any medical care or treatment beyond ``first aid'' regardless
of who provides such treatment. Medical treatment does not include diagnostic procedures, such as X-rays and drawing
blood samples.

<TEXT>
 
<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Are there other definitions of ``medical treatment'' that could clarify reportability?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Injury/Illness Reportability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) How are cases involving alleged noise-induced hearing loss by employees subjected to review or evaluation within
companies to determine whether FRA reportability criteria have been met?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Does the railroad's reporting officer determine reportability of noise-induced hearing loss or is this determination
made by another employee (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, industrial hygienist, supervisor)? If the ``reportability'' decision is made by someone other than the reporting
officer, how is this decision conveyed to the reporting officer?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Should the proposed internal control plan indicate how the review of an alleged noise-induced hearing loss case
is accomplished?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. ``Recordable'' Injury/Illness
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed to define ``recordable'' injury or illness as intending to encompass any condition, not otherwise reportable,
of a railroad worker that is associated with an event, exposure, or activity in the work environment that causes or
requires the worker to be examined or treated by a qualified health care professional. Such treatment would usually
occur at a location other than the work environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Does this proposed definition of ``recordable'' result in greater risk of a railroad supervisor exerting pressure
on an injured or ill employee to avoid seeing a physician so that the injury or illness is not reported to FRA?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. ``Recordable'' Rail Equipment Accident/Incident
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Likewise, a ``recordable'' rail equipment accident/incident would encompass any event not otherwise reportable
involving the operation of on-track equipment that causes physical damage to either the on-track equipment or the
track upon which such equipment was operated and that requires the removal or repair of rail equipment before any rail
operations over the track can continue. A ``recordable'' rail equipment accident/incident, if not tended to, would
thus disrupt railroad service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) FRA does not wish to place an undue reporting burden on railroads by requiring them to maintain a log of ``fender
bender'' accidents. What term or threshold could be used to capture these accidents in a listing or log?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) What elements or fields should be kept in the log that would provide FRA inspectors with enough information to audit
these nonreportable accidents without placing an undue burden on the railroads?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Is there a method of recording these accidents (below the reporting threshold) by means other than a standard form?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Please comment on the following alternate definition for a ``recordable'' rail equipment accident: a ``recordable''
rail equipment accident/incident is any event not otherwise reportable, involving the operation of on-track equipment
that causes physical damage to either the on-track equipment or to the track, roadbed, signals and/or structures
provided such equipment could be safely operated to its full range of function without repairs. (Note: Incidents
arising from broken knuckles, failed journals, and dragging equipment that does not cause damage beyond that of the
item of equipment that failed, are not required to be ``logged'' on Form FRA F 6180.xx).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Calculation of Damage Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed that material/equipment costs could be calculated based upon the costs of acquired new material, even
if the railroad chooses to use used or refurbished materials in its actual repairs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) What method(s) could be employed to accurately reflect the cost of accidents that would provide a comparable method
of comparison when using refurbished equipment?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) What alternative method could be employed that would accurately reflect the severity of accidents such that when
two identical derailments occur, they are reflected or rated identically even though their actual repair cost using
refurbished material are very different?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Seven-Day Notification (Proposed Section 225.39(a))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed that each railroad worker must notify his or her employer, in writing, of any reportable or recordable
injury or illness within seven calendar days of incurring or obtaining knowledge of such injury or illness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Should railroads require more immediate notice?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should the railroad worker be assessed a monetary penalty for failure to report an accident or injury to his or her
employer?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) Should the railroad worker's supervisor be assessed a monetary penalty for failure to report a known accident
or injury that occurred to a railroad worker?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) With respect to ``notifying his or her employer in writing,'' would the seven-day provision require employees
to complete the company's standard ``personal injury/illness statement'' for any alleged noise-induced hearing
loss case?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Should proposed &sect;225.39(a) contain language that would exclude the employee's ``seven-day notification
in writing requirement'' in the event of severe injury and fatality cases when it may not be possible for the employee
to comply with this provision?

I. Notification to Worker (Proposed Section 225.39(b))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed that each railroad shall provide a copy of the proposed Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log (Form FRA
F 6180.xx) to the injured or ill worker within seven calendar days of completing the log.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) What steps should be taken to notify the employee that his or her case has been reported to FRA? Could this be accomplished
without placing an excessive burden on the reporting railroad?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Should proposed &sect;225.39(b) contain language that would exclude the railroad from providing a copy of the
proposed Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log to the injured or ill worker within seven calendar days of completing
the log when this may not be possible in severe injury and fatality cases?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Recordkeeping (Proposed Section 225.25)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Logs for Recording Injuries (Proposed Section 225.25(a))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed that each railroad shall maintain the Railroad Worker Injury and Illness Log (Form FRA F 6180.xx) of all
reportable and recordable injuries and illnesses to railroad workers for each railroad establishment, including,
but not limited to, an operating division, general office, and major installation such as a locomotive or car repair
or construction facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) What technique do railroads currently utilize to record injuries, even those not reportable to the FRA?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Should FRA require railroads to maintain the employee's handwritten personal injury/illness statement on file?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Logs for Recording Accidents (Proposed Section 225.25(b))
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed that each railroad shall maintain the Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Log (Form FRA F 6180.xx(a))
and Property Damage Estimate Worksheet and Record (Form FRA F 6180.xx(b)) of reportable and recordable collisions,
derailments, fires, explosions, acts of God, or other events involving the operation of railroad on-track equipment,
signals, track, or track equipment (standing or moving) that result in damages to railroad on-track equipment, signals,
tracks, track structures, or roadbed, including labor costs and all other costs for repairs or replacement in kind
for each railroad establishment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FRA proposed requiring the gender and ethnicity of the injured or ill person on Form FRA F 6180.55a (Railroad Injury
and Illness (Continuation Sheet)), in an effort to help identify whether particular groups of individuals are more
susceptible than others to certain injuries and illnesses, particularly as trespassers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Are these elements (gender and ethnicity) necessary or desirable? Could an alternative be found that would serve
the same purpose, such as ``ability to read or comprehend instructions, signs, or warnings in English'' or ``ability
to interpret non-verbal instructions, signs, or warnings''?

FRA proposes to establish three SSB's on Form FRA F 6180.54 (Rail Equipment Accident/Incident Report) for the purpose
of temporarily collecting information on these issues of immediate safety concern. When one or more critical safety
issues arise, FRA would notify the railroad reporting officers and request that they, for a specified time-frame,
collect and report on the critical issues using the SSB. Upon expiration of the pre-defined time period, the SSB would
not be used again until the next issues of immediate concern.

FRA proposes to add two new questions to the Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Accident/Incident Report (Form FRA F 6180.57)
to gather information on whistle bans and signal system failures. New block ``34'' asks whether a whistle ban was in
effect and observed at the time of the accident/incident. New block ``35'' asks whether there was a signal system failure
within the last seven calendar days up to and including the day of the accident. The codes for completing both items
would be included in the FRA Guide.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Ford Motor Company (Ford) and the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (RVIA) have each submitted petitions
asking NHTSA to clarify some provisions in the roof crush resistance standard. Specifically, both these petitioners
suggested changes to the current specifications for placing the load plate on vehicles during compliance testing,
particularly vehicles with sloped aerodynamic roofs or raised roofs. NHTSA has granted both of these petitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Standard No. 216 (49 CFR 571.216) sets forth roof crush resistance requirements that must be met by passenger cars,
trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles with a GVWR of 6000 pounds or less. The purpose of the standard,
as stated in S2 of the standard, is ``to reduce deaths and injuries due to the crushing of the roof into the passenger
compartment in rollover accidents.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Standard No. 216 seeks to achieve this purpose by requiring vehicles to be certified as complying with a performance
test in which a load of 11/2 times the unloaded vehicle weight (up to a maximum of 5000 pounds for passenger cars) is applied
to the vehicle roof by means of a rigid unyielding block whose lower surface consists of a flat rectangle 30 inches wide
and 72 inches long. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the test, the plate is required to be positioned so that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) When viewed from the side of the test vehicle, the test plate is angled 5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; toward the front of the vehicle;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When viewed from the front of the test vehicle, the test plate is angled 25
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; below the horizontal on the side of the vehicle to which the test plate is applied; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The initial contact point of the test plate with the test vehicle roof is 10 inches from the forwardmost point of
the test plate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The test plate orientation and placement are illustrated in Figure 1 of Standard No. 216. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These requirements were initially proposed in a notice published on January 6, 1971 (36 FR 3) and are patterned after
the specifications in the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Standard J374. At that time, most vehicle roofs were
less rounded than today's designs, and there were no raised-roof vehicles to be tested. Thus, the specifications
for positioning the test plate ensured that it would be positioned to measure the roof's strength in the A-pillar region
and to ensure that the strength was sufficient to prevent sudden collapse of the roof above the A-pillars and front
seating areas during rollovers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
RVIA recently submitted a petition asking that vans, motor homes and other multipurpose passenger vehicles, trucks,
and buses that have raised roofs and that are now subject to Standard No. 216 be tested according to the requirements
of Standard No. 220, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
School Bus Rollover Protection. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Standard No. 220 subjects vehicles to the same force on the roof as does Standard No. 216 (11/2 times the unloaded vehicle
weight), but the force is applied differently. The test plate used in Standard No. 220 is larger than the 30&times;72
inch plate used in Standard No. 216. In addition, instead of concentrating the load in the vicinity of the A-pillars
the test load is evenly distributed over the entire roof in Standard No. 220.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RVIA used the following arguments to support its petition:

(1) There are several van conversions currently produced with raised roofs that are subject to Standard No. 216. Such
vehicles include conversions of the Plymouth Voyager, Doge Caravan, Chrysler Town &amp; Country, Chevrolet Astro,
and GMC Safari minivans. Because of the raised roof configuration, the load plate for the test cannot be placed according
to the specified procedure in the standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Since the original vehicles, prior to conversion that raises the roof, have been certified as complying with Standard
No. 216, the A-pillar strength will have already been demonstrated. Testing to Standard No. 220 after raising the
roof would then test the strength of the entire roof structure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Ford
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ford recently submitted a petition focused on what it believes is an anomaly with the current positioning procedures
for the test plate in Standard No. 216. Ford indicated that several of its models with aerodynamic roof designs have
roof slopes greater than 5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; at the forward edge of the roof. The test plate is required to be angled 5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; of the forward edge of the roof. The effect of the slope on these aerodynamic roof designs is that the initial point
of contact between the roof and the test plate is moved several inches behind the A-pillar when the test plate is positioned
according to the current placement procedure. Ford believes this rearward movement of the initial contact point
is contrary to the agency's intent when it initially promulgated the standard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford argued that additional support for this argument can be found in S6.2 of Standard No. 216, which specifies the
test plate should be applied by ``(o)rient(ing) the test device as shown in Figure 1 *&blank;*&blank;*'' Figure 1
clearly shows the test plate is applied at the front corner of the roof. Thus, for vehicles with sloped, aerodynamic
roofs, there is a conflict between Figure 1, which positions the test plate forward of the leading edge of the roof,
and S6.2(d), which specifies that the test plate should be positioned with reference to the initial point of contact,
even if that point is rearward of the leading edge of the roof. Ford acknowledged that NHTSA has addressed this conflict
in an October 3, 1980 interpretation, in which the agency said that the language of S6.2(d) should be used to position
the test plate, even if that means the test plate will not be forward of the A-pillar or the roof's leading edge. Ford
indicated that it has followed this interpretation, but it does not believe that such an interpretation results in
improved roof crush performance when vehicles are in use on the public roads.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford asked in its petition that S6.2(d) of Standard No. 216 be amended to specify that the leading edge of the test plate
should always be placed over the leading edge of the vehicle roof. Ford proposed the following language:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The initial contact point, or center of the initial contact area, is on the longitudinal centerline of the device.
A plane perpendicular to the lower surface of the test device and 25 mm rearward of the front edge of the lower surface
passes through the rearmost point of the opening in the body structure for the windshield.

Agency Response to the Petitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA believes that both of these petitions raise issues that should be examined further. RVIA believes the requirement
to move the test plate rearward of the A-pillar on conversion vans with raised roofs imposes needless and significant
burdens on second-stage manufacturers. Ford believes the requirement to move the test plate rearward of the A-pillar
on vehicles with aerodynamic roofs is contrary to the agency's original intent and results in a less stringent test
of the A-pillars' strength. both of these are relevant issues. Accordingly, the agency has granted both the RVIA and
Ford petitions. NHTSA is now conducting a research program to investigate the test methods described in these petitions
and to see if the current test procedures are suitable for vehicles with raised or contour roofs, or if some changed
test procedures are needed.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fact that the agency has granted these petitions does not mean that the requirements of the standard will necessarily
be modified. NHTSA has undertaken to investigate this issue more carefully and, after the conclusion of this investigation,
will decide whether it should propose any modifications to the test procedure. In the meantime, manufacturers must
continue to certify their vehicles for compliance according to the existing requirements of Standard No. 216 unless
and until some modified requirements are in place.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the fact that the agency has granted these petitions does not mean that NHTSA agrees with all that is said in
these petitions. For instance, the RVIA petition asks that Standard No. 220 test for roof crush resistance be substituted
for the current Standard No. 216 test for roof crush resistance. NHTSA is concerned that such a substitution could
result in a less stringent test over the front seating positions, or may not be appropriate to evaluate the strength
of the pillars for crush resistance. Standard No. 220 was developed for school buses and it assesses the roof crush
protection afforded for the entire seating area. It does this by using a test procedure that loads the entire roof structure,
including A-, B-, and any other pillars in the vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By way of contrast, Standard No. 216 is applicable to smaller vehicles. Front seat occupants experience the vast majority
of deaths and injuries in these vehicles. To address this, a test procedure was developed to assess the roof crush protection
afforded to front seat occupants. The test procedure concentrates the load in the vicinity of one of the A-pillars
to simulate the most severe impact condition that a pillar would experience in a rollover crash.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It appears, then, that substituting the Standard No. 220 test for raised roof vehicles instead of the Standard No.
216 test, would trade off increased roof crush protection for rear seat occupants in those vehicles, with diminished
protection for front seat occupants. However, there is no supporting information in the RIVA petition that quantifies
either how much protection front seat occupants might lose or how much protection rear seat occupants might gain from
this substitution. The agency will examine this carefully in its research before deciding whether to consider any
change to the current test requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, RVIA suggested that the strength of the A-pillars in the vehicle that is converted by its members would
be demonstrated by the original vehicle manufacturer's certification for the vehicle that complied with Standard
No. 216. The agency is not convinced at this point that this conclusion is valid because the agency has no data to prove
or disprove that the roof strength in the area of the A-pillars is affected by raised roof conversions. RVIA provided
no such data in its petition in support of their claim.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In its petition, Ford did provide some test data, although they were very limited. Ford provided roof crush test results
for two prototypes of a new vehicle design. In one, the test plate was positioned according to the current Standard
No. 216 procedures. In the second, the front edge of the test plate was positioned 100 mm behind the front corner of the
roof (closer to the A-pillar structure). The test results from the latter procedure produced a peak force that was
49 percent higher than the peak force produced using the current positioning procedure, within 5 inches of crush.
When following Standard No. 216 test procedures, the test plate was positioned 150 mm behind the windshield opening,
completely missing the A-pillar and leading edge of the roof.

Ford's petition indicates that its proposed change to the language of S6.2(d) would consistently locate the test
place one inch forward of the rearmost edge of the front windshield opening, thereby reducing test variability and
ensuring that the test plate is positioned ahead of the roof's leading edge. NHTSA notes that while this would position
the test plate over the leading edge of the roof, it would not necessarily load the roof at the rearmost windshield opening.
Ford's proposed change retained the same test plate angles currently specified in Standard No. 216, which means the
initial contact point for the test plate on the roof would be the same as at present. In other words, it appears to NHTSA
that Ford's proposal would ensure the consistent orientation of the test plate over the front of the roof, but would
not ensure that area of the roof would be tested. Further, the agency is uncertain whether the proposed test plate positioning
one inch forward of the rearmost edge of the front windshield opening would be an improved test for all vehicles with
uncommon roof shapes or whether it would reduce the stringency of the current test procedure.

Areas in Which the Public's Ideas and Information Are Requested
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency is interested in comments on the changes requested in both the Ford and RVIA petitions. Therefore, the agency
is seeking from all interested parties comments on the two proposals along with any available test data to substantiate
or refute those proposals. The agency is also interested in other ways to accommodate aerodynamically sloped and
raised roof vehicles. For instance, should the angles at which the test plate is applied and/or the size and shape of
the test plate itself be changed? If the plate size were reduced or if the plate shape were changed to circular, the test
plate could be placed over the A-pillar region on raised roof vehicles.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard No. 216 currently provides that the test plate shall be angled 5
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; toward the front of the vehicle, when viewed from the side of the test vehicle. This angle could be changed sufficiently
to ensure the test plate would contact the A-pillar region, with the new angle based on an analysis of real world crashes
and roof geometries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is also interested in any other approaches the public might wish to suggest in this area. As always, the most
helpful comments will be those that set forth data to substantiate the position taken in the comment. NHTSA would like
to alert commenters that the agency will not propose any changes to Standard No. 216 test procedures until the agency
is satisfied that data and analysis show the changes will not reduce real world safety protection for vehicle occupants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), requires that, for any petition to revise the List of Threatened and Endangered Species that contains substantial
scientific or commercial information indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted, a finding must be made
within 12 months of the date of receipt of the petition on whether the petitioned action is (i) not warranted, (ii) warranted,
or (iii) warranted but precluded by the efforts to revise the list and expeditious progress is being made in listing
and delisting species. Upon making the finding, a notice shall be promptly published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. With this notice, the Service announces its 12-month finding on the petition to list the Canada lynx is not warranted.
This finding is based on various documents, including published and unpublished studies, agency files, field survey
records, and consultations with other Federal and State agencies. This notice summarizes information contained
in the 12-month finding and represents the conclusion of the Service's status review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In August 1991, the U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service (Service) received a petition from several conservation organizations
requesting that the Service list the lynx of the North Cascades ecosystem as an endangered species and designate critical
habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 6, 1992, the Service published a notice of a petition finding indicating that there was not substantial
information to indicate that listing the North Cascades population of the Canada lynx as endangered may be warranted
(57 FR 46007). On July 9, 1993, the Service published a notice of a second finding on the North Cascades petition after
evaluating new information and again found that there was not substantial information to indicate that listing the
population may be warranted (58 FR 36924). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following publication of the notice, the petitioners filed suit challenging the finding. A settlement agreement
was reached on November 30, 1993, where the Service agreed to conduct a full status review of the lynx throughout its
range in the lower 48 States and to determine whether it qualified as endangered or threatened pursuant to 16 U.S.C.
Part 1533(a). On February 2, 1994, the Service published a notice (59 FR 4887) announcing continuation of a status
review initiated in 1982. The Service reviewed and considered public comments during its evaluation of the status
of the lynx in the contiguous U.S.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A petition dated April 23, 1994, was received by the Service from the Biodiversity Legal Foundation on April 27, 1994.
The petition requested that the conterminous U.S. population of the North American lynx (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Felis lynx canadensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) be listed as a threatened or endangered species. The petition provided numerous reasons for why the Canada lynx population
in the contiguous U.S. should be added to the List of Threatened and Endangered Species. The petitioners also requested
that the southern Rocky Mountain population of the lynx be protected by emergency listing because it is severely imperiled,
the population level is low, and it is reproductively isolated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Notice of a 90-day finding published in the August 26, 1994, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 44123) found that there was substantial information to indicate that listing the contiguous population of
the Canada lynx may be warranted. However, the notice also indicated that the petition did not present substantial
information to indicate the emergency listing of the Canada lynx in the southern Rockies is warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lynx, generally considered rare because of its secretive nature, is actually common throughout its Northern
American range. Lynx occupy the boreal regions of North America, commonly referred to as the Canadian and Hudsonian
Life Zones. These habitats are characterized by dense coniferous forests and wet bogs. Cold climates, deep snow,
and wildfire are major influences on these habitats. Lynx are found within these habitats from Newfoundland, Labrador,
and Quebec on the east to Alaska and British Columbia on the west; from the Arctic treeline south into portions of the
contiguous U.S. (Brittell et al. 1989). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific to the U.S., lynx distribution represents the fringe of the population occurring in its historic range.
Consequently, the lynx does not commonly occur within this southern limit of its range due to the lack of favorable
habitats. Favorable habitat conditions for the lynx dissipate with decreasing latitude. Thus, the lynx is restricted
to higher elevations the more southern the latitude. The most southern range extensions for the species are found
in the Rocky Mountains and associated high elevations. The distribution and population numbers of the lynx closely
follow that of the snowshoe hare, its primary food item. During population highs, snowshoe hare may occupy marginal
habitats thereby, allowing the lynx to widen their distribution (Brittell et al. 1989). During years of abundance,
lynx may extend their distribution and occur in higher densities along the southern extension of their range. This
fluctuation of population size and distribution is attributed to dispersal of predominately young animals from
the resident Canadian population. Local ``irruptions'' or invasions of lynx have been reported in the northern U.S.
following population highs further north in Canada. Population cycles may not be as noticeable in the southern extremes
of the lynx range because such habitat is not an important part of its range and U.S. resident populations are initially
low.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The historic range of the lynx in the contiguous U.S. has generally been recognized as including New England (Maine,
New Hampshire, Vermont and New York), the Great Lakes (Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota), the Rocky Mountains (Idaho,
Montana, Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado) and the Northwest Region (Washington and Oregon). There is evidence that presence
of lynx in the contiguous U.S. corresponded to cyclic dispersals from Canada (particularly in the Great Lakes region).
Thus, the Service believes that some of these States within the species' historic range never supported viable resident
populations of lynx over time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Northeastern and Great Lakes forests are sub-boreal forests and therefore fire regimes, important for the creation
of snowshoe hare habitat, do not function as in true boreal forests. Most of these original sub-boreal forests were
destroyed by lumbering and agricultural activities by the late 1880's and early 1900's. The lynx was already extirpated
from the New England States (except for Maine) by the turn of the century.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lynx were extremely scarce in the first half of the century in Montana. By 1979, the population was estimated to be between
1800 and 2500 animals. Lumbering activities and wildfire of the early 1920's, has affected Montana's present population
of lynx which is the largest in the contiguous U.S. Montana also has the largest amount of available habitat (Giddings
1994). In the Cascades (Northwest Region), lynx benefit from relative isolation of large undisturbed tracts of habitat
(approximately 3,673 square miles) and in the State of Washington, there is about 6,500 square miles of lynx habitat
(Brittell et al. 1989).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is one and the same species (a monotypic species) throughout its entire range in North America. The term ``species''
under the Act includes any subspecies of fish, wildlife, and plants, and any distinct population segment of any species
of vertebrate fish and wildlife which interbreeds when mature. The Service limited it status review of the lynx to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Canada lynx is widely distributed throughout the northern boreal forests of Canada and Alaska. Its extreme southern
limits are the U.S./Canada border areas with the southern-most extensions found in the Rocky Mountains. Historically,
lynx populations were minimal in the contiguous U.S. due to a lack of suitable habitat. During years of lynx abundance
in Canada increased densities of resident populations resulted along the southern boundary of its range. There is
evidence that the increased presence of lynx in the contiguous U.S. corresponds to cyclic dispersals from Canada.
At the turn of the century and especially in the Northeastern portion of the U.S., habitat loss due to human settlement
and forest clearing reduced the southern range of the lynx. Since the 1970's, this trend has reversed in some States.
Presently, Maine, Montana and Washington have resident lynx populations. In Montana prior to 1950, lynx were considered
to be extremely rare. Today, however, an estimated 700 to 1,050 lynx could occupy approximately 37,000 square miles
of montane forest habitat in Montana (Giddings 1994).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the contiguous U.S., lynx inhabit fairly remote, isolated areas. Before 1977, pelt prices were low, approximately
$12.00 a piece and lynx were harvested incidental to other furbearers. In 1977, all felids, including lynx, were listed
in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Appendix
II species may be internationally traded provided CITES export permits are issued. The issuance of permits provides
a means of monitoring trade and determining if it is having a significant impact on the species. In conjunction with
CITES, States are required to have a management program and a harvest season for the species. Presently only five States
have a trapping season for lynx_Alaska, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, and Washington. In 1984, Minnesota closed its
lynx season and Washington followed suit in 1990. Presently only Idaho and Montana of the lower 48 States allow a limited
annual harvest of two and three animals, respectively. These quotas include the incidental take of lynx by bobcat
trappers. From 1982 to 1992, only three lynx were trapped in Idaho. From 1993 to 1994, only four animals were taken in
Montana. These low harvest levels are contributed to the low level of hunting and trapping occurring in the remote
areas inhabited by lynx. Hunting and trapping pressure on the lynx has been historically low in the U.S. and there is
little evidence that these activities pose a threat to the continued existence of this species in the wild.

C. Disease or Predation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Canada lynx could be displaced or eliminated by expansion of competitors such as the bobcat (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lynx rufus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or coyote (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Canis latrans
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) into their present range. However, lynx are more restricted to areas that receive deep snow cover where they are more
highly adapted than are bobcats. Neither disease nor predation is known to be a threat to the lynx.

D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The lynx is protected in each State where it occurs in the lower 48 contiguous States. Seven States classify it as threatened
or endangered or a species of concern. Idaho and Montana have a trapping season with annual Statewide harvest quotas
of two and three animals, respectively. Hunting and trapping with dogs and taking with firearms is illegal in every
State except one in which the lynx occurs. Few if any States ever had a bounty system for the species. In addition to State
protection, the lynx has been listed in Appendix II of CITES since 1977, and its status and harvest levels have been
monitored by the Service's Office of Scientific Authority.

E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued Existence
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Lynx distribution has not significantly changed from historic ranges except for periodic peripheral shifts of distribution
with cyclical changes of its chief prey, the snowshoe or varying hare (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lepus americanus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and local losses due to loss of habitat in southern-most areas. Fire suppression in the contiguous 48 States has
had some effect on lynx numbers, since early successional habitats are important to lynx due to a greater abundance
of snowshoe hares in these areas. Although early regeneration stages of habitat are preferred by hares, lynx hunt
primarily in more open mature and later successional stages of forest.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires the Service to make determinations regarding listings solely on the basis of the best available scientific
and commercial data after conducting a review of the status of the species and after taking into account those efforts
being made by State and Federal agencies to protect the species. The Act also allows for the Service to list ``distinct
population segments'' of vertebrate fish and wildlife.

The Service was petitioned to list the Canada lynx in the 40 contiguous States as a vertebrate population pursuant
to the Endangered Species Act. The Service conducted a status review of the Canada lynx in the contiguous U.S. After
carefully evaluating the best available scientific and commercial information regarding the past, present and
future threats faced by this species, the Service finds that listing of the Canada lynx in the contiguous U.S. is not
warranted. The Service also finds that the petition did not present substantial information that the southern Rocky
Mountain population of the Canada lynx meets the definition of a ``species'' under section 3(15) of the Act.

The Canada lynx is naturally low density-occurring carnivore throughout the northern boreal forests of Canada and
Alaska with its extreme southern limits occurring south of the U.S./Canada border. It was never a common species in
the contiguous U.S. because of limited suitable habitat and, except for in Maine, Montana and Washington, little
evidence of breeding populations south of the border exists. Presence of the species in most of the contiguous 48 States
corresponds to cyclic dispersals from Canada.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the turn of the century, habitat loss due to human settlement and forest clearing reduced the range of lynx in southern
areas. However, the lynx currently occupies much of its original historic range. The Service is unable to substantiate
that trapping, hunting, poaching, and present habitat destruction threaten the continued existence of the lynx
in the wild in the contiguous U.S. Consequently, the Service finds that listing the Canada lynx in the contiguous U.S.
is not warranted. The Service's 12-month finding contains more detailed information regarding the above decisions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On March 30, 1993, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
determining the coastal California gnatcatcher to be a threatened species (58 FR 16741). In its decision to the list
the gnatcatcher, the Service relied, in part, on taxonomic studies conducted by Dr. Jonathan Atwood of the Manomet
Bird Observatory, Manomet, Massachusetts. As is the standard practice in the scientific community, the Service
did not request, nor was it offered, the data collected and used by Dr. Atwood in reaching his conclusions. Instead,
the Service depended upon the conclusions published by Dr. Atwood in a peer-reviewed scientific article on the subspecific
taxonomy of the California gnatcatcher (Atwood 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to a suit filed by the Endangered Species Committee of the Building Industry Association of Southern California
and other plaintiffs, the United States District Court of the District of Columbia vacated the listing of the coastal
California gnatcatcher because the Service did not make available Atwood's data for public review and comment. In
response to the court decision, Dr. Atwood released his data to the Service, which the agency made available to the
public for review and comment on June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28508). On June 16, 1994, the court reinstated threatened status
for the coastal California gnatcatcher until the Secretary of the Interior determines in a finding whether the listing
should be revised or revoked in light of his review of the subject data and public comments received during the comment
period. As a result of the court orders of July 27, 1994, and September 30, 1994, the Service extended the comment period
to December 1, 1994, (59 FR 38426, 59 FR 44125, and 59 FR 53628).

The Service received 11 substantive comments in response to the request for public comments on Dr. Atwood's data and
analysis. Of particular note, Dr. William Link mathematician, and Grey Pendleton, biometrician, with the National
Biological Survey (NBS) conducted new analyses of these data and presented it in a report (Link and Pendleton 1994).
Their four conclusions were:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That the morphological characters in Atwood's data set vary along the geographical gradient, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That the changes in characters are more reasonably represented by discrete groupings than by a gradual pattern
of change, and are thus consistent with the existence of subgroups within the population, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That there is at least 1 break north of site 5 (Atwood's BG27) [approximately 30
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; N latitude], and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) That there is at least 1 break south of site 5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the Service received two additional statistical analyses (Dr. Atwood; and Dr. Karen Messer, Department
of Mathematics, California State University, Fullerton) that supported a southern terminus of 30
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; N latitude for the coastal California gnatcatcher. However, the Service received three significant comments
that, for various reasons, did not support such a southern terminus (Dr. George Barrowclough, ornithologist from
New York; Dr. Lyman McDonald, consultant from Wyoming; and Dr. James MacMahon and other colleagues, College of Science,
Utah State University).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the NBS report (Link and Pendleton 1994), the Service reopens the comment period to ensure that the public
may review and comment on this and other significant comments and analyses received during the original public comment
period. The comment period is opened through January 26, 1995.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates international
trade in certain animal and plant species. As a general rule, exports of animals and plants listed on Appendix II of
CITES may occur only if a Scientific Authority has advised a permit-issuing Management Authority that such exports
will not be detrimental to the survival of the species and if the Management Authority is satisfied that the animals
or plants were not obtained in violation of laws for their protection. Based on documentation presented for consideration
by the CITES Parties in 1983, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has determined that the American alligator
is listed on Appendix II for reasons of similarity in appearance under Article II.2(b) of CITES as well as the potential
threat to the species survival under CITES Article II.2(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

This notice announces proposed findings by the U.S. Scientific Authority and Management Authority on the export
of alligators harvested during the 1995&hyph;1997 taking seasons from certain States previously approved for such
export for the 1992&hyph;1994 harvest seasons and for the State of Arkansas which was previously approved for the
1994 harvest season. These proposed findings also stipulate that monitoring procedures previously established
for this species be continued.

In addition, references in the regulation concerning the manner in which tags are to be attached to American alligator
hides at the time of export and the conditions for export of parts and products are being clarified.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Since 1977, the Service has employed the rulemaking process to develop and issue decisions on the export of certain
species under CITES. The reason for this approach is that it is more effective to issue general decisions on the export
of all specimens of a species harvested in a given State and season than to issue such decisions separately for each
permit application. This is especially true for CITES Appendix II species that are frequently exported, such as the
American alligator. On May 26, 1992 (57 FR 21896), the Service published rules granting export approval for American
alligators (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Alligator mississippiensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) from specified States for the 1992&hyph;1994 harvest seasons. Subsequently, based on advice from the Office of
Scientific Authority and the Office of Management Authority, the Service also approved the export of farm-raised
American alligators from the State of Arkansas for the 1994 harvest season. The purpose of this current proposal is
to develop a rule that will allow the export of legally taken American alligators (hides, meat, parts, and products)
for the 1995&hyph;1997 harvest years from previously approved States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The American alligator is listed in Appendix II to respond both to problems of potential threat to the survival of the
species [CITES Article II.2(a)] and of the similarity of appearance to other crocodilians that are threatened with
possible extinction [CITES Article II.2(b)]. Article IV of CITES requires that an export permit for any specimen
of a species included in Appendix II shall only be granted when certain findings have been made by the Scientific Authority
and Management Authority of the exporting country. The marking of hides with specified tags, the marking and documentation
of shipments of meat and parts, and the issuance of export permits specifically for American alligator parts and products
is considered sufficient to address the issue of identification due to similarity in appearance between American
alligators and other listed crocodilian species. Because the alligator is listed partly due to the potential threat
to its survival based on previous population declines that have been reversed in most parts of its range in the United
States, the Service must determine that allowing exports and thereby stimulating harvest will not be detrimental
to the survival of the species itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The U.S. Scientific Authority must develop advice on nondetriment for the export of Appendix II species in accordance
with Section 8A of the Endangered Species Act (Act) of 1973, as amended. The Act states that the Secretary of the Interior,
``shall base such determinations and advice given by him under Article IV of the CITES with respect to wildlife upon
the best available biological information derived from professionally accepted wildlife management practices;
but is not required to make, or require any State to make, estimates of population size in making such determinations
or giving such advice.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Minimum Requirements for a Management Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) There should be a controlled harvest with the methods and seasons determined by the State; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) All hides, meat, and parts should be registered and marked; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Harvest level objectives should be determined annually by the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In applying these guidelines, the Service considers the following types of information on the conditions of the population:
(a) A current estimate [if such information is available] of the total number of animals in the pre-harvest population
derived by appropriate scientific censusing methodology; (b) a description of ongoing research being conducted
to assess the distribution, abundance, or general condition of the species in the State with a summarization of results
obtained, including results of any analysis of age structure or reproductive parameters; and (c) an assessment of
long-term population trends of the species in the State and the relationship of these trends to habitat conditions,
management practices, harvest pressure, and/or other factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information on anticipated harvest to be considered by the Service includes: (a) The number of animals to be harvested
[by county or game management unit, if data are available at these local levels]; (b) the number of alligator hunters
expected to be licensed; and (c) the time of the harvest season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the case of the alligator, as with most other wild animals, the resource is monitored by a variety of techniques that
yield information used in evaluating the condition of a population. As these data are accumulated over time, they
reflect trends and call attention to changes in the populations. Habitat information, indices of population size,
age and sex structure, and harvest information are all used to evaluate population status. Although the Endangered
Species Act Amendments of 1982 provided that population estimates are not to be required for the approval of export
of Appendix II wildlife, if such estimates are provided by the States or are otherwise available, they will be considered
together with information of the types listed above in making findings on nondetriment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to considering the effect of trade on species or populations native to the United States that are being
exported, the Scientific Authority will also monitor the status of the American alligator to: (a) Determine whether
treatment of the American alligator remains appropriate; and (b) detect any significant downward trends in the populations
and, where necessary, advise on more restrictive export controls in response to these trends. This monitoring and
assessment will follow the same procedures adopted for other CITES-listed species (see 49 FR 590, January 5, 1984).
The Service will review information on population status and harvest data relevant to the no detriment finding process
from each export-approved State, as appropriate. When indicated by available information and a thorough review
of accumulated data, a determination can then be made about the treatment of this species and whether the management
program needs to be adjusted in a particular State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The status of the American alligator has dramatically improved throughout its range since the species was placed
under State and Federal control. One of the primary reasons for this improvement has been the effective management
programs administered by State wildlife agencies. The Service expects these management programs to continue to
be effective in conserving the American alligator in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The export of American alligators taken in the 1992 through 1994 harvest seasons in certain States was previously
approved by the Service (57 FR 21896). In that rule, the Service found that current information on the population status,
management, and harvest available from the States included in the rule, along with other information collected by
the Service, supported a finding that the export of American alligators taken in accordance with State regulations
in those States and in those harvest seasons would not be detrimental to the survival of the species in those States
approved for export. The Service's previous assessment of the status of the alligator under the Endangered Species
Act was sufficient to support reclassification of the species throughout its range from threatened to threatened
for similarity of appearance. This reclassification was accomplished in different parts of its range as the biological
status of the alligator improved. The following rulemaking documents provide the rationale for the removal of threatened
and endangered listings: 40 FR 44412, September 26, 1975; 42 FR 2071, January 10, 1977; 44 FR 37130, June 25, 1979; 46
FR 40664, August 10, 1981; 48 FR 46332, October 12, 1983; 50 FR 25672, June 20, 1985; and 51 FR 19760, June 2, 1986.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon information available from the previously approved States and in consideration of the tagging requirements
stipulated by the Management Authority, the Service proposes to issue Scientific Authority advice in favor of export
of alligator hides and parts legally harvested in those States during the 1995&hyph;97 harvest seasons.

Management Authority Findings

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Exports of Appendix II species are to be allowed under CITES only if the Scientific Authority advises that the exports
will not be detrimental to the survival of the species and if the Management Authority is satisfied that the specimens
were not obtained in contravention of laws enacted for their protection. The Service, therefore, must be satisfied
that the American alligator hides, meat, or products being exported were not obtained in violation of State or Federal
laws for their protection. For the American alligator, evidence of legal take is provided by Service-approved State
export tagging and container marking programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist these State export tagging programs, the Service annually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts for the manufacture and delivery of special CITES animal-hide tags for Service-approved, export-qualified
States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, published on April 24, 1986 (51 FR 15548), the Service announced the introduction, use, and protection of
a US-CITES tag symbol. This symbol appears on every Service-approved export tag to provide legal evidence of U.S.
export approval for certain species listed on Appendix II of CITES. Hides marked with tags that lack this US-CITES
symbol are not legally exportable from the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Guidelines developed for Management Authority findings on State-managed American alligator export programs,
under provisions of CITES Article IV.2(a), are summarized as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Current State alligator trapping, hide tagging, meat and parts processing, marking, and shipping regulations
must be on file with the Office of Management Authority; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Sample reporting forms, export tag, meat and parts packing seal, parts tag, and specifications of the State's
standard meat and parts package/container must be on file with the Office of Management Authority; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The hide export tag must be durable and permanently locking, and must show the US-CITES logo, State of origin, year
of take, species, and a unique serial number; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The export tag, meat seal, and parts tag or seal must be applied to all hides, meat, or parts within a minimum time
after take or processing as specified by State law and such time should be as short as possible to minimize movement
of untagged hides, meat, or parts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) US-CITES tags must be inserted through the hide and permanently locked in place using the locking mechanism of
the tag and in accordance with State requirements; other tags or seals must be permanently attached as mandated by
the State; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) All American alligator harvesters and processors must be State registered; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) All American alligator hide, meat, and parts dealers must be State registered; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) All State-registered American alligator harvesters, processors, and dealers must make available their American
alligator harvest and commerce data to the State on at least an annual basis, as specified by the State; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) State-registered American alligator dealers and State licensed harvesters authorized to attach export tags
must account for tags received and must return unused tags to the State within a time specified by the State after the
taking season closes; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) When manufactured hide products are to be exported from the United States, the CITES export tags that were removed
from the hides contained in the products must be surrendered to the Service prior to export.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon: (1) The finding of nondetriment by the Scientific Authority, and (2) information available from the previously
export-approved States, the Service proposes to issue Management Authority approval for the export of American
alligators legally harvested during 1995&hyph;1997 from those States previously approved for such export, including
Arkansas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Multiyear Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has monitored existing State programs for the American alligator in most of the previously approved States
for many years and expects these States will continue to satisfy CITES requirements. States seeking for the first
time to establish a harvest program for alligators should apply for CITES export approval no later than January 2 of
the year before they plan to initiate such a program. To ensure that export-approved States maintain successful programs
and that export is not detrimental to the survival of the species, the Service plans to continue annual monitoring
of State management and export marking programs through evaluation of State annual reports and export reports from
U.S. ports. Annual State program reports should be provided to the Office of the Management Authority (address given
above) for review no later than May 31 of each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Proposed Findings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service proposes to find that the status of the species and State programs is such that the 1995&hyph;1997 harvests
of American alligators for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
export will not be detrimental to the survival of the species. Accordingly, the Service proposes to approve exports
of 1995&hyph;1997 harvested alligators from the States previously approved for export, including Arkansas, on
the grounds that both Scientific Authority and Management Authority export requirements have been satisfied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments Solicited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service requests comments on these proposed findings. Final findings will take into consideration the comments
and any additional information received, and such consideration may lead to final findings that differ from this
proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service requests information on environmental or economic impacts and effects on small entities (including
small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions) that would result from findings
for or against export approval. This information may aid the Service in further evaluating the conclusions stated
below. This proposal is issued under the authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Effects of the Rule and Required Determinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has determined that these proposed findings are not a major Federal action significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment under the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321&hyph;4347), and therefore
the preparation of an environmental impact statement is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. For the 1995&hyph;97
harvest years, the Service analyzed the impacts and again concluded that the 3-year rule was not a major rule and did
not have significant economic effects on a substantial number of small entities as outlined under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). Because the proposed rule treats exports on a State-by-State basis and proposes to approve export in accordance
with State programs, the rule would have little effect on small entities in and of itself. The proposed rule would allow
continued international trade in American alligators in accordance with CITES, and it does not contain any Federalism
impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It also has been determined that this proposed rule does not contain information collection requirements that require
approval by OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document is in response to a petition requesting the issuance of regulations that will establish specific protection
zones around every northern right whale (as well as around all other whales). It solicits public comment and information
to assist in determining the need for and types of conservation measures that would be effective in minimizing human-induced
disturbance of and harmful interaction with northern right whales.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The western North Atlantic population of northern right whales (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Eubalaena
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
glacialis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is estimated to consist of 300&hyph;350 animals. Although protected by international agreements for over 50 years,
the growth rate of this population remains at an extremely low level relative to the growth rates of right whale populations
in the southern hemisphere that have been similarly protected (Kraus, 1990). It has been suggested that both natural
and human-induced factors are responsible for the absence of measurable growth in the northern right whale population.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One human-induced factor thought to be a substantial threat to the recovery of the northern right whale, as identified
in the Recovery Plan for Northern Right Whales (NMFS, 1991), developed under section 4(f) of the Endangered Species
Act (ESA), 16 U.S.C. 1533(f), is disturbance by vessels. Northern right whale behavior occurring at the water's surface,
such as resting, skim feeding, and courtship, makes them susceptible to disturbance by vessels. Further, it appears
that vessel traffic has a measurable effect on large whales, including right whales. These effects include overt
changes in direction of swimming, changes in respiration patterns, changes in dive time/surface time ratios, and
changes in acoustic behaviors. In particular, right whale cows with calves and single long-diving whales appear
to be sensitive to sound and have been observed to avoid boats (Kraus and Mayo, unpubl. data). Finally, turbulence
associated with vessel traffic may also indirectly affect northern right whales by breaking up the dense surface
zooplankton patches in certain whale feeding areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 5, 1994, NMFS received a petition from Greenworld, Inc. requesting that, in order to address this perceived
problem, NMFS issue regulations establishing a 500&hyph;yard (yd) (460 meter(m)) radius protection zone around
every right whale and, citing the similarity of appearance provision of section 4(e) of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. 1533(e),
a 100&hyph;yd (90m) radius protection zone around all other whales. The petition also suggested that any vessel approach
of a right whale closer than 500&hyph;yds (or 100&hyph;yds for other whales) be considered an incidental take under
the ESA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS has previously received information suggesting similar actions. During the comment period following the proposed
rule to designate critical habitat for the right whale (final rule at 59 FR 28793, June 3, 1994), several commenters
recommended that a distance buffer be established around each right whale. To allow whales to avoid oncoming vessels
and vessels to avoid whales, commenters indicated that, at the time of critical habitat designation, restrictions
or modifications of shipping lanes and shipping practices needed to be made. Another commenter suggested that a minimum
vessel approach distance of 100&hyph;300m be established around right whales. Finally, a commenter recommended
that NMFS establish a 500m radius protection zone around every right whale in every area designated as critical habitat,
and prohibit any person from knowingly entering or remaining within this zone. This commenter noted that such a buffer
would be consistent with rules already adopted by NMFS, citing, as examples, the minimum distance rules for humpback
whales (

) in Hawaii (50 CFR 222.31) and the 5.5km (5500m) zone established around Steller sea lion rookeries and major haulouts
in Alaska (50 CFR 226.12). The commenter further explained that right whale protective zones for the areas proposed
to be designated as critical habitat in Cape Cod Bay and Stellwagen Bank would be consistent with existing Massachusetts
regulations (322 CMR 12.00

.), which implement a 500&hyph;yd buffer zone between right whales and vessels and prohibit activities of vessels
that negatively impact right whales within Massachusetts waters. (Critical habitat for the northern right whale
was designated by final rule published on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 28793).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the petition and comments, NMFS is soliciting information from the public which confirms or rebuts the
proposition that disturbance from directed vessel interaction, other than collisions, can cause harm to right whales
that is detrimental to recovery of the species. Assuming disturbance from vessel interaction may be harmful, NMFS
seeks suggestions of appropriate measures to minimize the harmful effects of directed vessel interactions on northern
right whales, including possible exceptions and variations.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS announces the intention of the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) to prepare an EIS for proposed
Amendment 1 to the Atlantic Bluefish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). Current stock assessment information indicates
that bluefish are overfished, and the FMP contains no fishing mortality rate reduction strategy. Additional management
measures are necessary for both the recreational and the commercial fisheries. In the development of Amendment 1,
the Council proposes to consider additional management measures for both recreational and commercial fisheries
along with a reevaluation of existing management objectives. The Council also announces a public process for determining
the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues relating to revising the management
of bluefish. The purpose of this document is to inform the public of the commencement of a scoping process and to provide
the opportunity for public participation in the development of Amendment 1 to the FMP. All persons affected by, or
otherwise interested in, the proposed amendment are invited to participate in determining the scope of significant
issues to be considered in the EIS by submitting written comments. The scoping process also will identify and eliminate
from detailed study issues that are not significant.

saltatrix
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) is all bluefish in U.S. waters in the western Atlantic Ocean. Current stock assessment information indicates that
bluefish are overfished. Based on the overfishing definition in the FMP, the exploitation rate would have to be reduced
by 50 percent to end overfishing. Because the FMP contains no strategy for reducing fishing mortality, additional
management measures are necessary in both the recreational and the commercial fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bluefish management is further complicated by the multi-species/multi-gear nature of the fishery. Any management
program developed for this Amendment must recognize that bluefish may continue to be caught and killed if these gears
continue to be fished, even though their use may be directed at other species.

Objectives
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Part of the scoping process is the possible reevaluation of the existing objectives. The major goal of the FMP is to
conserve the bluefish resource along the Atlantic coast. Five major objectives have been adopted to achieve this
goal: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Increase understanding of the stock and of the fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provide the highest availability of bluefish to U.S. fishermen while maintaining, within limits, traditional
uses of bluefish (defined as the commercial fishery not exceeding 20 percent of total catch). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Provide for cooperation among the coastal states, the various Regional Marine Fishery Management Councils, and
Federal agencies involved along the coast to enhance the management of bluefish throughout its range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Prevent recruitment overfishing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Reduce waste in both commercial and recreational fisheries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Measures
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Possible management measures for the commercial fishery include, but are not limited to, minimum and/or maximum
fish size, minimum mesh size, closed seasons and areas, quotas (including adjustments among states), a moratorium
on vessels, individual transferable quotas, dealer and vessel permits and reports, operator permits, trip limits,
and gear restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Possible management measures for the recreational fishery (including that sector of the fishery that carries recreational
fishermen for hire) include, but are not limited to, minimum and/or maximum fish size, maximum possession limit,
closed seasons and areas, gear restrictions, quotas (including adjustment among states), restrictions on the sale
of recreationally caught fish, dealer and vessel permits and reports, and operator permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that permits would be mandatory for: Vessels landing bluefish for sale; dealers purchasing bluefish
from permitted vessels; party and charter boats in the Atlantic bluefish fishery. Further, it is anticipated that
vessels landing bluefish for sale would need to submit logbooks; dealers purchasing bluefish from permitted commercial
vessels would need to submit reports; and operators of charter and party boats would need to submit logbooks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Paperwork Reduction Act forms (SF&hyph;83) prepared by NMFS for Amendment 2 to the Summer Flounder FMP, the
Dealer Purchase Report was estimated to involve 1,255 respondents and 26+ responses per respondent per year, for
a total of 33,135 responses at 0.0448 hours per response, for a total of 1,485 burden hours. The Vessel Logbook was estimated
at 1,314 respondents, 12 responses per respondent, at 0.08 hours per response, for a total of 1,261 burden hours. The
Vessel Permit was estimated at 24,943 annual responses at 0.2878 hours per response, for a total of 7,179 burden hours.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar burden hours should be experienced through bluefish management. There may be a reduction because vessels
with summer flounder permits may qualify for the bluefish fishery. Currently, operating permits are required in
the Northeast Multispecies, Atlantic Sea Scallop, and Summer Flounder FMPs. It is expected that the burden hours
for the operator permit will be similar to those estimated for the Summer Flounder Operator Permit.

Timetable for EIS Preparation and Decisionmaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Council has adopted a tentative amendment preparation, review, and approval schedule for Amendment 1. Under
this schedule, the Draft EIS is planned for completion prior to the Council's September 1995 meeting. If an acceptable
Draft is completed, the Council would decide at that meeting whether to submit the draft EIS for public review. Oral
comments to the Council on their decision could be made at that meeting. If the Council's decision is affirmative,
public review of the draft EIS would occur during 45 days in October and November 1995. At its January 1996 meeting,
the Council would decide on any revisions to the proposed management regime of bluefish, and oral comments on the decision
could be made to the Council at that meeting. If the Council's decision is affirmative, the EIS would be made final and
submitted with the amendment recommendation and other rulemaking documents to NMFS for review and approval. The
Council reserves the right to modify or abandon this schedule if necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Magnuson Act, NMFS review and approval of a proposed amendment is completed in no more than 95 days and includes
concurrent public comment periods on the amendment and proposed regulations. If approved by NMFS under this schedule,
the revised bluefish management measures would be effective in 1996.

The petitions were submitted pursuant to Section 251 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2341). Consequently, the United
States Department of Commerce has initiated separate investigations to determine whether increased imports into
the United States of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by each firm contributed importantly
to total or partial separation of the firm's workers, or threat thereof, and to a decrease in sales or production of
each petitioning firm.

and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217-222). ODFW requested an increase
in the take of this species for the period 1994&hyph;95 only and an expansion of their research sampling area to include
Catherine Creek in the Grande Ronde River Basin for the duration of the permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that on December 15, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the ESA, NMFS issued Modification
4 to Permit 818 for the above taking, subject to certain conditions set forth therein. In Modification 4 to Permit 818,
NMFS included precautions that ODFW are required to implement to prevent accidental listed fish mortalities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issuance of this modification, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such modification: (1) Was applied
for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is the subject of the permit;
and (3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This modification was also issued
in accordance with and is subject to parts 217-222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits.

Import Situation and Conclusion

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
U.S. imports of men's and boys' wool suits, Category 443, from Guatemala began in September of 1993 and reached a 12
month year-ending August 1994 (September 1993-August 1994) level of 63,959 units (5,330 dozen). Guatemala's imports
in calendar year 1993 (September-December) were 7,915 units (660 dozen). There were no Category 443 imports from
Guatemala during the year-ending August 1993 nor during calendar year 1992. Guatemala shipped 1,930 units (161 dozen)
in calendar year 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sharp and substantial increase in Category 443 imports from Guatemala is disrupting the U.S. market for men's
and boys' wool suits.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
U.S. production of men's and boys' wool suits, Category 443, declined from 383,000 dozen in 1992 to 326,000 dozen in
1993, a 15 percent decrease. Production for the first half of 1994, at 164,000 dozen, was flat relative to the 162,000
dozen produced during January-June 1993. U.S. production for the year-ending June 1994 was 9 percent below the year-ending
June 1993 level. By contrast, U.S. imports increased from 278,000 dozen in 1992 to 309,000 dozen in 1993, an 11 percent
increase. Imports continued to increase in 1994, reaching a record level of 334,000 dozen for the year-ending August
1994, 11 percent above the 302,000 dozen imported during the same period a year earlier.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ratio of imports to domestic production increased from 73 percent in 1992 to 95 percent in 1993, and continued to
increase in 1994, reaching 100 percent during the year-ending June 1994_U.S. imports equalled U.S. production.
The U.S. producer's share of the domestic market fell from 58 percent in 1992 to 51 percent in 1993, a decline of seven
percentage points. The U.S. producer's share declined to 50 percent for the year-ending June 1994.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1990 Congress enacted statutory amendments which increased the maximum civil penalty amounts that could be imposed
under the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act and the Flammable Fabrics Act. The amendments
also provided for periodic adjustments to those maximum amounts. As calculated in accordance with the amendments,
the new amounts are $6,000 for each violation, with a maximum of $1,500,000 for any related series of violations.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 1990 (Improvement Act), Public Law 101&hyph;608, 104 Stat. 3110 (November
16, 1990) amended provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act (CPSA), the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA)
and the Flammable Fabrics Act (FFA). The Improvement Act added civil penalty authority to the FHSA and FFA, which had
previously only contained criminal penalties. 15 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;1264(c) and 1194(e). The Improvement Act
also increased the maximum civil penalty amounts that would apply to civil penalties under the CPSA: $5000 per violation
and $1,250,000 for any related series of violations. These same maximum penalty amounts applied to the newly-created
civil penalties under the FHSA and FFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Improvement Act further directed that the maximum civil penalty amounts be adjusted periodically for inflation.
The CPSA, FHSA and FFA were amended to state: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) The maximum penalty amounts authorized in paragraph (1) [the provision that sets the current maximum amounts
of $5,000 and $1,250,000] shall be adjusted for inflation as provided in this paragraph. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Not later than December 1, 1994, and December 1 of each fifth calendar year thereafter, the Commission shall prescribe
and publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 a schedule of maximum authorized penalties that shall apply for violations that occur after January 1 of the year immediately
following such publication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) The schedule of maximum authorized penalties shall be prescribed by increasing each of the amounts referred to
in paragraph (1) by the cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding five years. Any increase determined under the
preceding sentence shall be rounded to_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) in the case of penaties greater than $1,000 but less than or equal to $10,000, the nearest multiple of $1,000; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) in the case of penalties greater than $10,000 but less than or equal to $100,000, the nearest multiple of $5,000;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) in the case of penalties greater than $100,000 but less than or equal to $200,000, the nearest multiple of $10,000;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) in the case of penalties greater than $200,000, the nearest multiple of $25,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) For purposes of this subsection: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The term ``Consumer Price Index'' means the Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department
of Labor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The term ``cost-of-living adjustment for the preceding five years'' means the percentage by which_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(I) the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the adjustment; exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(II) the Consumer Price Index for the month of June preceding the date on which the maximum authorized penalty was last
adjusted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission's Directorate for Economics has calculated that the cost-of-living adjustment increases the maximum
civil penalty amounts to $5,962.93 for each violation and to $1,490,733.28 for any related series of violations.
(The back-up information on these calculations is available from the Office of the Secretary.) Rounding off these
numbers in accordance with the statutory directions, the adjusted maximum amounts are $6,000 for each violation
and $1,500,000 for any related series of violations. These adjusted amounts substitute for the previous amounts
contained in the CPSA, 15 U.S.C. &sect;2069(a)(1); in the FHSA, 15 U.S.C. &sect;1264(c)(1); and in the FFA, 15 U.S.C.

 notice was not published before December 1, 1994. Therefore, the Commission has decided that the new maximum penalty
amounts should apply to violations that occur after January 26, 1995, rather than violations that occur after January
1, 1995. This provides a 30-day effective date; the Improvement Act anticipated that the adjusted penalties would
apply no earlier than one month after public notice in the

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice is to advise interested parties that Wilford Hall Medical Center (WHMC) has been designated as the first
national STS facility for liver transplants. The STS Program establishes new requirements for CHAMPUS beneficiaries
to obtain some highly specialized health care services from selected military and civilian treatment facilities.
These designations will be based on the highly specialized capabilities of those selected facilities. The purpose
of such designations is to concentrate patient referrals for certain highly specialized procedures which are of
relatively low incidence and/or relatively high per-case cost and which require patient concentration to permit
resource investment and enhance the effectiveness of quality assurance efforts.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) requires that the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) provide interested Federal agencies and the public an early opportunity to comment on information collection
requests. OMB may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation
in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal law, or substantially
interfere with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Director of the Information Resources
Group, publishes this notice containing proposed information collection requests prior to submission of these
requests to OMB. Each proposed information collection, grouped by office, contains the following:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
The applications and prepared affidavits are for submission of data necessary to determining dischargeability
of obligations of student borrowers (or their parents). Dischargeability would occur in situations where their
attending schools closed, or where school officials have falsely certified such students as able to benefit or have
forged their signatures. ED will evaluate the data and determine if the borrower is eligible for a loan discharge.

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's
(Commission) regulations, 18 CFR Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed
the application for a original, minor license for the Lake Casitas Power Recovery Facility (project), and has prepared
a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project. The project is located on the Bureau of Reclamation's existing
pipeline between its Casitas dam and its water treatment plant, near the City of San Buena Ventura, in Ventura County,
California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential future environmental impacts of the project and has
concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective measures, would not constitute
a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at
941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any comments should be filed within 30 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary,
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. All comments should
clearly show the following caption on the first page: LAKE CASITAS POWER RECOVERY FACILITY, FERC NO. 11285&hyph;001.

Take notice that on December 16, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas,
77252&hyph;2511, filed in Docket No CP95&hyph;121&hyph;000 an abbreviated application pursuant to Section 7(b)
of the Natural Gas Act, as amended, and Sections 157.7 and 157.18 of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission)
regulations thereunder, for permission to abandon two compressor units and appurtenant facilities located in Chautaugua
County, New York, by sale to Hanover Compressors (Hanover), all as more fully set forth in the application which is
on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tennessee proposes to abandon two 500 horsepower units and appurtenant facilities. Tennessee advises that it acquired
the compressor units on January 1, 1992, under Tennessee's blanket certificate authorization granted in CP82&hyph;413.
Tennessee states that the producer at this facility, Belden &amp; Blake, has advised Tennesee that it plans to install
its own compression, thus obviating the need for Tennessee's compressors altogether. Tennessee indicates that
it no longer has any gas purchase obligations behind these facilities and that the proposed abandonment would not
result in the loss of gas service to any existing transportation customer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before January
10, 1995, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC, 20426, a petition to intervene or a
protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or
385.211) and the regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will
be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make protestants parties
to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to the proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing
therein must file a petition to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and procedure a hearing will be held without further notice before filed within the time required herein, and if the
Commission on its own review of the matter finds that the abandonment is required by the public convenience and necessity.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The National Estuary Program (NEP) was established under section 320 of the Clean Water Act (CWA), as amended by the
Water Quality Act of 1987. The purpose of the NEP is to promote long-term planning and management in nationally significant
estuaries threatened by pollution, development, or overuse. This goal is achieved through the preparation of a Comprehensive
Conservation and Management Plan (CCMP) which documents the problems and recommends approaches for correcting
and preventing problems for each estuary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NEP seeks to protect and improve water and sediment quality and to enhance living resources by helping to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Establish working partnerships among federal, state, tribal, and local governments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Fully utilize scientific and management experience in development of CCMPs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Increase public awareness of pollution problems and ensure public participation in consensus building; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Promote basinwide planning to control pollution and manage living resources; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Oversee development and implementation of pollution abatement and control programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under CWA section 320(a), the Governor of any State may nominate an estuary located wholly or partly within the State
and request that the Administrator of EPA convene a management conference to develop a CCMP for the estuary. Where
Tribal lands are located within estuary boundaries, the nomination should also include a letter of agreement from
the Tribal Governor or equivalent. Nominations must document the national significance of the estuary, the need
for a management conference, its likelihood of success, its ability to streamline, commitment to implement actions
and its organizational ability to oversee implementation. In response to a Governor's nomination or on his own initiative,
the Administrator is authorized to determine whether the attainment or maintenance of a desired level of water quality
in an estuary requires additional pollution abatement and control programs to supplement existing controls. Based
on this determination, the Administrator is authorized to convene management conferences for such estuaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has determined that the addition of new estuaries to the NEP beyond the existing 21 will foster environmental management
efforts in coastal areas. Based on this determination, the Administrator will convene additional management conferences
in Fiscal Year 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Preparation of Nominations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many of the elements of estuarine management employed in the NEP are being applied by public and private parties in
estuaries that are not currently part of the National Estuary Program. Substantial progress towards meeting some
NEP objectives has been realized in some of these estuaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these factors, and experience gained from the existing 21 management conferences, EPA believes it will be
possible to more quickly and economically develop CCMPs for estuaries to be designated in the future. Therefore,
when considering management conferences to be convened in Fiscal Year 1995, EPA will give preference to nominations
that describe actions underway to identify and characterize environmental problems and their causes, established
partnerships among governmental and private groups with natural resource management and protection missions,
public involvement in developing and executing action strategies, and the state's ability to support CCMP implementation.
The information kit provides further details on the information which should be presented in the nomination to allow
the Administrator to determine whether a candidate estuary should be selected for the NEP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nominations should be prepared based on EPA's instruction kit entitled 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Streamlined National Estuary Program: Instructions on the Preparation of a Governor's Nomination. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The EPA will provide an instruction kit upon request to assist interested States in preparing their nominations.
This instruction kit includes background information, a copy of section 320 of the CWA, and nomination content checklist.
Requests for this instruction kit should be made to the US EPA Regional office that serves the interested state. Contact

Discount Tire and Automotive, Inc. ($5,550.50); For Douglas (Transportation Motor Pool) ($20,092.05); and Parley's
Way Conoco ($4,701.60). EPA has determined that it is necessary to reissue the public notice for these settlements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In exchange for payment, U.S. EPA will provide the settling parties with a covenant not to sue for liability under sections
106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, including liability for EPA past costs, the one-time cost of remedy, future EPA oversight
costs, future operation and maintenance of the as-yet unselected remedy, and under section 7003 of the Solid Waste
Disposal Act, as amended (also known as the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount that each individual PRP will pay, as shown above for Settlement 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1, equals $2.97 multiplied by the number of gallons of waste the party sent to the Site (Base Amount), plus a premium
payment of either 30% or 120% of the Base Amount, as specified by each Respondent PRP in the AOC. The per gallon charge
of $2.97 was calculated by dividing the total estimated response costs for the Site ($69,594,403) by the total estimated
volume of waste disposed of at the Site (23,454,592 gallons). For parties paying a 30% premium, the ``Option A'' settlement,
there is an exception to the covenant not to sue if total response costs at the Site exceed $69,594,403. If this amount
were exceeded, EPA could sue these parties for all or a portion of the overage. For parties paying the 120% premium,
the ``Option B'' settlement, the exception to the covenant not to sue does not apply.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By the terms of the proposed AOC for this settlement, these 22 PRPs will together pay $357,111.00 to the Hazardous Substance
Superfund (Superfund). The $357,111.00 represents approximately 0.5% of the total anticipated costs for the Site
upon which this settlement was based.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In exchange for payment, U.S. EPA will provide the settling parties with a covenant not to sue for liability under sections
106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, including liability for EPA past costs, the one-time cost of remedy, future EPA oversight
costs, future operation and maintenance of the as-yet unselected remedy, and under section 7003 of the Solid Waste
Disposal Act, as amended (also known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amount that each individual PRP will pay, as shown above for Settlement #2, has been reduced in consideration of
the ability of the settling party to pay. EPA has determined that the settling parties cannot afford EPA's least expensive

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 parties at the Site; that is, the ``Option A'' settlement. The settlement amount for each settling party has been reduced
to the maximum amount EPA has determined the party is able to pay. Each settling parties' settlement amount equals
$2.97 (derived and described above) multiplied by the number of gallons of waste the party sent to the Site (Base Amount),
plus a premium payment of 30% of the Base Amount, minus an adjustment reflecting EPA's determination that the party
is unable to pay the full settlement amount, referred to in the AOC as the ``inability-to-pay factor.'' The proposed
AOC for all settlors participating in Settlement #2 contains an exception to the covenant not to sue if total response
costs at the Site exceed $69,594,403. If this amount were exceeded, EPA could sue these parties for all or a portion
of the overage.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Farm Credit Act of 1971 (1971 Act), as amended, gives the Farm Credit Administration (FCA) broad powers to issue
and amend the charters of Farm Credit System (System) institutions and regulate the exercise of their powers. The
FCA Board has concluded that institutions should have the maximum degree of flexibility possible in proposing official
names for their institutions and should not have to use trade names that are more commonly accepted than their official
names. At the same time, the official name of an institution should always be one that can be readily identified by the
public as belonging to an institution affiliated with the System. In addition, there must be a simple way for the public
and the FCA to be able to identify the name as belonging to one of the various types of institutions regulated by the FCA.
To reaffirm, by formal FCA Board Action, the continuing validity of the policy statement which requires Farm Credit
Banks and associations to include as a part of their official name their statutory or regulatory designation or the
appropriate acronym, the FCA Board has reaffirmed its policy statement on Farm Credit Institution Names adopted
by the FCA Board and stated in the preamble to the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To ensure that the public can identify the name of the Farm Credit institution as belonging to one of the various types
of institutions regulated by the Farm Credit Administration (FCA). To allow the maximum flexibility possible for
Farm Credit Banks and associations in proposing official names for their institutions. To ensure that the various
types of institutions can be easily identified by the FCA for regulation and examination purposes.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Objective:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 To reaffirm, by formal FCA Board Action, the continuing validity of the policy statement which was first adopted in
1988 and which requires Farm Credit Banks and associations to include as a part of their official name their statutory
or regulatory designation or the appropriate acronym. Also, to ensure that the official names recorded in all charters
and charter amendments that are requested by the Farm Credit Banks and associations and issued by the FCA follow the
policy specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Operating Principles:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 With the exception of the provisions of section 413 of the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (1987 Act) regarding the
National Bank for Cooperatives, the 1987 Act and the Farm Credit Act of 1971 as amended (the Act), do not expressly require
any of the various types of banks and associations to use a specific name in its official title. However, prior to the
1987 Act, the Act referred to each of the different banks and associations by using specific names such as ``production
credit association,'' ``Federal land bank association,'' and ``bank for cooperatives.'' Based on these statutory
references, the FCA, in granting charters to institutions, has required that the official names of institutions
include the appropriate name used in the statute. Thus, for instance, associations chartered under title II of the
Act were required to use ``production credit association'' as part of their official name.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Enactment of the 1987 Act, particularly the provisions authorizing the merger of unlike banks and associations,
has caused the FCA to reevaluate its policies regarding the official names of institutions. The FCA Board has concluded
that institutions should have the maximum flexibility possible in proposing official names for their institutions.
At the same time, the official name of an institution should always be one that can be readily identified as belonging
to one of the various types of institutions regulated by the FCA. For instance, one must be able to know whether a bank
can lend to cooperatives, like a bank for cooperatives, or whether an association can only make short-term loans,
like a PCA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FCA Board has now determined that it will issue charters for institutions which contain the statutorily sanctioned
names ``production credit association,'' Federal land bank association,'' ``bank for cooperatives,'' and ``Farm
Credit Bank.'' If an institution requests an official name that does not incorporate one of those terms, the official
name must include the acronym for the appropriate term after the name. For instance, the Production Credit Association
of North Central Jersey could request a change in its name to ``Farm Credit Services of North Central Jersey, PCA.''
The FCA Board will also issue charters for institutions that contain the name ``agricultural credit association,''
for an association formed by the merger of a production credit association and a Federal land bank association, the
name ``Federal land credit association,'' for a Federal land bank association that has direct lending authority,
and the name ``agricultural credit bank,'' for a bank formed by the merger of a Farm Credit Bank and a bank for cooperatives.
If such an institution requests an official name that does not include the appropriate term, the name must be followed
by the acronym ``ACA,'' ``FLCA,'' or ``ACB.'' For instance, a Federal land bank association that has acquired direct
lending authority could use names such as ``Farm Credit of Central City, FLCA,'' or ``Federal Land Bank Association
of Central City, FLCA.''

Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Reserve proposes to reduce the reporting frequency from once a month to once a year, and to eliminate nine
of the thirteen items on the report. The panel selection criterion for future panel additions would change from the
100 most active issuers to those whose acceptances outstanding exceed $50 million on their quarterly condition reports.
The proposed revisions would reduce the annual reporting burden for this report by 97 percent.

Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each financial institution that acts as a government securities broker or dealer is required to notify its appropriate
federal regulatory agency of its broker-dealer activities by filing an FR G&hyph;FIN, unless exempted from the notice
requirement by Treasury Department regulation. Financial institutions that have previously filed an FR G&hyph;FIN
and that have terminated their broker-dealer activities must notify their appropriate federal regulatory agency
by filing an FR G&hyph;FINW. The revisions involve clarifying the instructions as to the appropriate regulatory
authority for various categories of government securities brokers and dealers to reflect the Government Securities
Act Amendments of 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The filing of this application is required of a Municipal Securities Dealer Bank (MSD) and a person associated with
a MSD, prior to such person functioning in a professional capacity. This application serves to verify compliance
with the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and with related securities and banking laws. It is also
used as a source document for entry into an interagency computer system of records. The MSD&hyph;5 notice must be filed
within 30 days after a person associated in a professional capacity with a bank municipal securities dealer terminates
employment. The notice is a compliance vehicle for rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and for related
securities and banking laws. It is also a source document for updating information on an interagency computer system
of records. The proposed revisions involve changing the phrasing of one item on the FR MSD&hyph;4.

 This interagency form fulfills the statutory registration requirements for entities acting as transfer agents
and enables certain basic information changes concerning the transfer agents to become known by the supervisory
agencies. Minor changes to the form are proposed to clarify the reporting of information relative to the location(s)
where transfer agent activities are conducted and relative to those instances where transfer agents contract to
either perform transfer activities for others or have transfer activities performed for themselves.

System (Board) its approval authority under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as per 5 CFR 1320.9, to approve of
and assign OMB control numbers to collection of information requests and requirements conducted or sponsored by
the Board under conditions set forth in 5 CFR 1320.9. Board-approved collections of information will be incorporated
into the official OMB inventory of currently approved collections of information. A copy of the OMB 83I and supporting
statement and the approved collection of information instrument(s) will be placed into OMB's public docket files.
The following forms, which are being handled under this delegated authority, have received initial Board approval
and are hereby published for comment. At the end of the comment period, the proposed information collection, along

Abstract:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The FR 2915 reporting form collects weekly averages of the amounts outstanding for foreign (non-U.S.) currency deposits
held at U.S. offices of depository institutions, converted to U.S. dollars and included in the FR 2900 (OMB No. 7100&hyph;0087),
the principal deposits report that is used for the calculation of required reserves and for construction of the monetary
and reserves aggregates. Foreign currency deposits are subject to reserve requirements and, therefore, are included
in the FR 2900. However, foreign currency deposits are not included in the monetary aggregates. The FR 2915 data are
used to back foreign currency deposits out of the FR 2900 data for construction of the monetary aggregates. The FR 2915
data also are used to monitor the volume of foreign-currency deposits.

The Federal Reserve proposes to reduce the reporting frequency for current monthly reporters to quarterly. The proposed

Abstract: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This report is filed by bank holding companies that have received the Board's approval by Order to engage in limited
underwriting and dealing in securities of a type which a bank may not underwrite or deal in directly. The report consists
of a balance sheet, statement of income, supporting schedules for securities owned, and a statement of changes in
stockholders' equity. In addition, there are several memoranda items which collect information on intercompany
liabilities and off-balance sheet items, and information that is needed for an alternative measure of indexed-revenue.
The proposed minor change, to become effective as of December 31, 1994, involves the addition of memoranda items on
the income statement to collect year-to-date gross income, total expenses, and net income.

 Notice is hereby given of initial approval, and public comment is requested, by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the Board) under delegated authority from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), as per 5 CFR 1320.9
(OMB Regulations on Controlling Paperwork Burdens on the Public), to the revision of the Consolidated Financial
Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y&hyph;9C; OMB No. 7100&hyph;0128); the extension, with revision, of
the Annual Report of Bank Holding Companies (FR Y&hyph;6; OMB No. 7100&hyph;0124), the Combined Financial Statements
of Nonbank Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies (FR Y&hyph;11Q; OMB No. 7100&hyph;0244) and the Annual Report
of Selected Financial Data for Nonbank Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies (FR Y&hyph;11I; OMB No. 7100&hyph;0218);
and the elimination of the Combined Financial Statements of Nonbank Subsidiaries of Bank Holding Companies, by Type
of Nonbank Subsidiary (FR Y&hyph;11AS; OMB No. 7100&hyph;0244). Following review of public comments, the Board
will take final action. The proposed reporting changes, summarized in this notice, will be effective for the FR Y&hyph;9C,
FR Y&hyph;11Q, and FR Y&hyph;11AS with the March 31, 1995 reporting date and effective for the FR Y&hyph;11I for the
December 31, 1995 reporting date. The Federal Reserve anticipates making the proposed reporting changes to the FR
Y&hyph;6 effective December 1994 unless significant objections from the public are received during the comment
period.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, the Board is responsible for the supervision and regulation
of all bank holding companies. The FR Y&hyph;9 and FR Y&hyph;11 series of reports historically have been, and continue
to be, the primary source of financial information on bank holding companies and their nonbanking activities between
on-site inspections. Financial information, as well as ratios developed from the Y series reports, are used to detect
emerging financial problems, to review performance for pre-inspection analysis, to evaluate bank holding company
mergers and acquisitions, and to analyze a holding company's overall financial condition and performance as part
of the Federal Reserve System's overall analytical effort. The FR Y&hyph;6 report is the Federal Reserve's principal
source of internally generated and independently audited financial data on individual bank holding companies and
their banking and nonbanking subsidiaries. The report enables the Federal Reserve to monitor bank holding company
operations and to ensure that the operations are conducted in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with the provisions
of the Bank holding Company Act and Regulation Y.

The FR Y&hyph;9C consolidated financial statements are currently filed by top-tier bank holding companies with
total consolidated assets of $150 million or more and by lower-tier bank holding companies that have total consolidated
assets of $1 billion or more. In addition, all multibank bank holding companies with debt outstanding to the general
public or engaged in certain nonbank activities, regardless of size, must file the FR Y&hyph;9C. The following bank
holding companies are exempt from filing the FR Y&hyph;9C, unless the Board specifically requires an exempt company
to file the report: bank holding companies that are subsidiaries of another bank holding company and have total consolidated
assets of less than $1 billion; bank holding companies that have been granted a hardship exemption by the Board under
section 4(d) of the Bank Holding Company Act; and foreign banking organizations as defined by section 211.23(b) of
Regulation K. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The report includes a balance sheet, income statement, and statement of changes in equity capital with supporting
schedules providing information on securities, loans, risk-based capital, deposits, interest sensitivity, average
balances, off-balance sheet activities, past due loans, and loan charge-offs and recoveries.

The Federal Reserve proposes the following revisions to the FR Y&hyph;9C. Most of the proposed new items are needed

(2) Modify the reporting instructions for the category labeled ``mortgage-backed securities'' to capture more
securities of this nature. In addition, the caption for the existing item of collateralized mortgage obligations
(CMOs) and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association
(FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) would be modified to explicitly refer to the REMICs
that the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) has recently begun to issue.

The FR Y&hyph;6 is an annual report filed by the top-tier bank holding companies. Foreign banking organizations as
defined by section 211.23(b) of Regulation K are not required to file this form. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The FR Y&hyph;11Q is filed by all bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more, regardless
of whether or not the bank holding companies own any nonbank subsidiaries and by all bank holding companies with total
assets of $150 million or more but less than $1 billion that meet one or more of the following conditions: (a) the assets
of the holding company's nonbank subsidiaries constitute 5 percent or more of the holding company's total consolidated
assets; or (b) the net income of the holding company's nonbank subsidiaries make up 5 percent or more of the holding
company's total consolidated net income; or (c) the holding company's investment in and/or loans and advances to
nonbank subsidiaries exceed 5 percent of the holding company's total consolidated equity capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The report collects basic financial information on nonbank subsidiaries and consists of a balance sheet, income
statement, and a memoranda section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Reserve proposes the following revisions to the FR Y&hyph;11Q:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Expand the report to collect more detailed financial information, comparable to items collected on the FR Y&hyph;9C.
The proposed comprehensive financial statements include a balance sheet, off-balance sheet items, a memoranda
section, an income statement, and a statement of changes in equity capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Revise the reporting criteria for bank holding companies with assets of $150 or more to collect information on
an individual basis from each nonbank subsidiary viewed as having a significant effect on the condition of the bank
holding company. All bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $150 million or more would file a report
for each individual nonbank subsidiary with total assets equal to 5 percent or more of the bank holding company's consolidated
Tier 1 capital, or where the subsidiary's total operating revenue equals 5 percent or more of the bank holding company's
consolidated total operating revenue.

of whether or not the bank holding companies own any nonbank subsidiaries and by all bank holding companies with total
assets of $150 million or more but less than $1 billion that meet one or more of the following conditions: (a) The assets
of the holding company's nonbank subsidiaries constitute 5 percent or more of the holding company's total consolidated

The Board certifies that the above bank holding company reporting requirements are not expected to have a significant
economic impact on small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The
reporting requirements for the small companies require significantly fewer items of data to be submitted than the
amount of information required of large bank holding companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information that is collected on the reports is essential for the detection of emerging financial problems, the
assessment of a holding company's financial condition and capital adequacy, the performance of pre-inspection
reviews, and the evaluation of expansion activities through mergers and acquisitions. The imposition of the reporting
requirements is essential for the Board's supervision of bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act.

This notice invites comments on proposed clauses that will implement industrial funding of the Federal Supply Service,
Federal Supply Schedule Program. As directed by the House of Representatives' Committee on Appropriations, the
Federal Supply Service of GSA has examined a number of alternatives for reimbursable funding of several of its programs
for which it currently receives appropriations. The Federal Supply Schedule Program was identified as appropriate
for conversion to an industrially funded operation. It has been determined that the most viable method of reimbursable
funding of schedule program would be through adjusting the schedule contract prices upward by 1%.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this concept, schedule pricelists would show the adjusted price. Agencies would order from the contractor
at the adjusted price; the contractor would invoice GSA at the award price; GSA would bill agencies the adjusted price
and retain the difference to fund the program. This method of funding is consistent with a National Performance Review
recommendation that GSA service operations be paid for through customer revenues. Under this concept, agencies
would continue to submit purchase/delivery orders directly to the contractor; however, contractor invoices would
be sent to GSA for payment.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Federal Supply Schedule Program is a major contracting program used by the Federal Supply Service (FSS) to provide
a variety of commercial supplies and services to Federal Government agencies. The program accounts for over $2.8
billion in sales annually, and provides lucrative contracting opportunities for over 5,000 commercial contractors,
most of which are small business entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the fiscal year 1994 budget process, Congress directed FSS to review its appropriated activities for conversion
to reimbursable funding. Based upon that review, the schedules program was identified as one of the programs suitable
for reimbursable funding. The GSA fiscal year 1995 budget, therefore, reflected a $7.8 million reduction in operating
expenses for the schedules program. The remaining appropriated monies will be eliminated over the next two fiscal
years. The cost of providing supplies and services through this program must therefore be included in the cost of those
supplies and services. FSS will accomplish this by adjusting each schedule contract award price upwards by 1%. For
example, a retail price for an item is $100.00. GSA negotiates a discount of 10 percent resulting in an award price of
$90.00. The schedule pricelist will reflect an adjusted price of $90.90. The contractor delivers the goods to the
agency and invoices GSA in the amount of $90.90 (the award price). GSA bills the agency the adjusted schedule pricelist
amount of $90.90. GSA retains the $.90 adjustment as it cost recovery allowance charge, thereby funding the program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Currently, schedule contractors must submit invoices to multiple agencies' payment offices. FSS proposes to establish
the GSA Kansas City Finance office as the single payment point for all schedule contractors' invoices. Implementation
of industrial funding for the schedules program will have minimal impact on the basic principles of the program. Schedule
offers will continue to be evaluated and negotiated by GSA. The Government's pricing goal will continue to be most
favored customer status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agencies will continue to place orders directly with the schedule contractors. Agencies will also continue to use
Activity Address Codes (AAC) and Fund codes that they are using in the current supply systems. Agencies without AAC's
can obtain them by following the simple instructions in the GSA FEDSTRIP Operating Guide, or they can contact the FSS
System, Inventory, &amp; Operations Management Center, (703) 305&hyph;7083. Fund codes are assigned within each
individual agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All contract administration matters relating to agencies' orders remain the responsibility of the agencies placing
the orders. As envisioned, the only change in the process will be in the area of payment. Instead of invoicing the individual
agencies, contractors will submit their invoices to GSA for payment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSA has planned a 3-year implementation period for converting all schedules to a full cost recovery program; however,
the implementation plan may be expedited contingent and consistent with changes in GSA's appropriations.

Subject: Industrial Funding of Federal Supply Schedule Program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Purpose. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To provide guidance for industrial funding of the Federal Supply Schedule program in order to recover associated
procurement and administrative costs incurred by the Federal Supply Service (FSS) for contracting through the schedules
program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Background. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During the fiscal 1994 budget process, Congress directed FSS to review its appropriated activities for conversion
to reimbursable funding. Based upon that review, the schedules program was identified as one of the programs suitable
for reimbursable funding. The GSA fiscal year 1995 budget, therefore, reflected a $7.8 million reduction in operating
expenses for the schedules program. The remaining appropriated monies for the program will be eliminated over the
next two fiscal years. The cost of providing supplies and services through this program must therefore be included
in the cost of those supplies and services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal Supply Schedule Program is FSS' largest supply support program, accounting for over $2.8 billion in sales
annually. The program benefits the customer agencies, as well as the contractors who participate in the program.
Federal agencies benefit from the schedules program because it provides an expedited means for acquiring quality
commercial products, including latest technology, at reasonable prices based on the Government's aggregate buying
power. Contractors benefit from the program because it provides them a low cost entry into the Federal market. By obtaining
a schedule contract with GSA, contractors avoid the administrative cost of responding to multiple solicitations
from many different agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to better serve our customers and suppliers, FSS is implementing a single payment office, GSA, to handle schedule
invoices. Agencies will continue to forward delivery/purchase orders directly to the schedule contractors, who
will in turn deliver requisitioned items directly to the agencies. However, instead of invoicing the agencies, the
contractors will submit their invoices (for both supplies and services) to the GSA Office of Finance for payment.
GSA will bill the agencies. (See attached Outline of Payment/Billing Steps.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new payment arrangement eliminates the agencies' responsibilities related to processing and paying thousands
of invoices. Government payment offices will be billed twice a month by GSA. Based on the above, agencies should enjoy
substantial administrative savings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSA, as the single paying office, will be able to maximize timely payments, thus, avoiding interest charges and earning
prompt payment discounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Schedule contractors will benefit by not having to deal with numerous agency accounts payable offices. Further,
they will no longer have to cope with a variety of different accounts payable procedures, since they will only be subject
to GSA's procedures. As the single payment office, GSA's commendable record for timely payment of invoices will result
in contractors being paid much quicker than many are now experiencing from some schedule users.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSA will recover the costs associated with contracting, billing, and payment of schedule purchases by adjusting
the awarded price upward by one percent. This adjusted price will be the price printed in the schedule contract pricelist.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GSA's negotiation objectives will include consideration of the new simplified payment terms and conditions and
will seek discount concessions recognizing the benefits to contractors of streamlined payment procedures. Contractors
will bill GSA at the negotiated contract prices. GSA's billings to ordering activities will be at the printed schedule
pricelist amounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present strategy calls for a 3-year implementation beginning in fiscal year 1995. As current schedules expire,
new basic solicitations will include the new clauses which will provide for funding of the program. At the completion
of the 3-year implementation period, any existing contracts that do not contain the new clauses will be modified to
incorporate these provisions. The implementation schedule may be expedited contingent and consistent with changes
in GSA's appropriations.

Applicability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All Federal Supply Service schedule contracting activities must implement the provisions of this acquisition letter.
All basic schedule solicitations issued on or after the effective date of this letter must contain the new clause and
notice shown in the attachment. Schedule solicitations that have been issued, but not opened/closed, must be amended
to include the new schedule payment and billing procedures. Appropriate solicitation extensions should be provided
to allow offerors sufficient time to consider the new provisions. In addition, multiple award solicitations which
have closed, but have no awards against them yet, should be amended to incorporate the new provisions. Offerors should
be requested to acknowledge, in writing, their acceptance of the new provisions within the terms of their offer, prior
to the award of a contract. If an offeror is unwilling to accept the new single payment arrangements, he/she will be
allowed to withdraw his/her offer.

Instructions/procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Promoting the advantages of a ``one-stop'' payment office will be the responsibility of all persons involved with
schedule contracting. Benefits are realized by customer agencies, schedule contractors, GSA, and the taxpayers.
Every effort should be made to inform contractors and agencies of the advantages of designating GSA as the single payment
point. Equally important is the need to encourage both agencies and contractors to maximize their use of Electronic
Data Interchange (EDI) to transmit purchase/delivery orders and invoices. Contractors may also receive Electronic
Fund Transfer (EFT) payments, whether they submit paper or electronic invoices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. In order to facilitate the payment and billing process by Finance, agencies will be required to include the Activity
Address Code (AAC) to be billed, and a two digit Fund Code to be charged on each purchase/delivery order submitted to
contractors. These codes will expedite GSA's process for billing the agencies for reimbursement of monies paid by
GSA to the contractors. Inclusion of the AAC and Fund code on all purchase/delivery orders is required before invoicing
GSA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. (1) The Catalogs and/or Pricelists clauses will be revised to instruct schedule contractors to adjust the awarded
schedule prices upward by 1%. Purchase/delivery orders will show this adjusted price. Contractors, on the other
hand will invoice GSA at the awarded (unadjusted) prices.) For example:

(2) Contractors will also be instructed to include a statement substantially as follows on the cover page, or in order
instructions on the pricelist: ``Agencies are reminded to include the Activity Address Code (AAC) to be billed and
the Fund code to be charged on each purchase/delivery order. These codes are needed to expedite payment of invoices
and billings by GSA to agencies.'' Contractors may also include a sample order form for informational purposes to
assist agencies in including all pertinent information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. In addition to the AAC and Fund code and other standard information included on the purchase/delivery order, agencies
should provide the following with each order:

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Two agency contact points (including commercial phone number): one from the ordering office, and, one from the
office to receive the billing from GSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Cite GSA as the office to be invoiced for payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. During the initial phase of this changeover to a single payment office, contracting officers may receive inquiries
from agencies and schedule contractors regarding the billing AAC and Fund code. The six-digit AAC is a code assigned
to an agency in order to establish an account with GSA. The AAC identifies the agency to GSA. Agencies may obtain AAC
numbers by writing to: GSA/FSS, Inventory and Requisition Management Division (FCSI), Washington, DC 20406, or
calling (703) 305&hyph;6978. Fund codes are not assigned by GSA but by each individual agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. In addition to submitting purchase/delivery orders directly to the contractor via hard copy or EDI, agencies may
also obtain schedule items by placing requisitions through MUFFIN (Multi-Use File for Inter-Agency News), or normal
FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP ordering procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Agencies shall forward an original and one copy of paper purchase/delivery orders to schedule contractors. Any
oral order placed against a schedule contract must be confirmed with either an electronic (EDI) or hard copy purchase/delivery
order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
h. The Office of Finance, Kansas City, will be the payment office for all schedule invoices. For paper invoices containing
prompt payment discount terms, the address is: General Services Administration, PO Box 419399, Kansas City, MO 64141&hyph;6399.
All other paper invoices should be sent to General Services Administration, PO Box 419029, Kansas City, MO 64141&hyph;6029.
Initial invoices for each purchase/delivery order must be accompanied with a copy of the customer paper or EDI order.
Contractor EDI submissions of order data and invoices must be in accordance with Federal implementation conventions
for EDI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. As is the current practice, ordering activities will resolve any discrepancies concerning purchase/delivery
orders and/or items delivered against such orders directly with the schedule contractors. The GSA contracting officer
may need to intervene in order to settle unresolved issues between an ordering activity, a contractor and/or the Office
of Finance. Any setoffs for collection of monies owed the Government must be handled in accordance with FAR Subpart
32.6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. The contractor represents by submission of an invoice that the supplies have been delivered or services performed
satisfactorily. GSA reserves the right to require proof of shipment or evidence of delivery/performance prior to
payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. Pursuant to the clause, Examination of Records by GSA (552.215&hyph;70) and FAR, Subpart 4.7, contractors are
required to retain files, records, and information relevant to this contract, including records to support shipments
and deliveries for up to 3 years after final payment, or as specified in Subpart 4.705 through 4.705&hyph;3, whichever
of these periods expire first. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
l. GSA, Office of Finance will implement a post payment statistically reliable system to validate agency receipt
of goods or services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
m. The following clause and cover page notice must be included in all new basic Federal Supply Schedule solicitations:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. The General Services Administration (GSA) will be the centralized billing/payment office for all purchases/invoices
issued against the schedule contracts. Paper invoices (with related purchase/delivery order copies) conforming
to the requirements of the Prompt Payment Clause (52.232&hyph;25) and the Invoice Requirements Clause (552.232&hyph;72)
should be submitted to either of the following mailing addresses:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. For paper invoices (with related purchase/delivery order copies) containing prompt payment discounts: General
Services Administration, Office of Finance, P.O. Box 419399, Kansas City, MO 64141&hyph;6399.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. For all other paper invoices (with related purchase/delivery order copies): General Services Administration,
Office of Finance, P.O. Box 419029, Kansas City, MO 64141&hyph;6029.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Inclusion of the Activity Address Code (AAC) and Fund code on all purchase/delivery orders is required before invoicing
GSA. EDI transactions must be submitted in accordance with Federal implementation conventions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Contractors shall submit invoices and copies of the agencies' purchase/delivery orders either by Electronic
Data Interchange (EDI), or mail for non-/EDI transactions. Submission of invoices by EDI is preferred because it
is the most economic and efficient method for the contractor and the Government.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Agencies will submit purchase/delivery orders to contractors in an original and one copy. A copy of the customer
agency EDI or paper purchase/delivery order must accompany each initial invoice submitted to GSA for payment. In
the case of ongoing service arrangements like rental or leasing, this means the contractor must include a copy of the
purchase/delivery order for such arrangements with the initial EDI or paper invoice submitted for payment. It will
not be necessary to submit subsequent copies of the same order unless requested by GSA for a particular case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Proper invoices will be paid within the prompt payment discount terms included in the contract or 30 day payment
cycle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. Electronic submissions must conform to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) X12 standard and the
Federal implementation conventions. Request for these conventions and questions regarding registration in the
Government Electronic Commerce system should be addressed to 1&hyph;800&hyph;EDI&hyph;3414. Registration is
done via your value added network and includes acceptance of the Government Trading Partner Agreement (TPA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
g. Initial invoices (both paper and EDI) cannot be processed for payment without submission of a copy of the corresponding
agency purchase/delivery order. Any data the ordering activity requests for inclusion on the invoice must be included
on the invoice sent to GSA. Include applicable Special Item Numbers (SIN's) and/or part numbers if not referenced
in the customer's order. Pursuant to the Prompt Payment Act, improper invoices will be returned to the contractor.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
h. Ordering activities may purchase open market items on the same purchase/delivery order form used to order items
from the schedule contract if the acquisition is made at the lowest overall cost. The invoiced amount may include allowable
nonschedule items. (However, the invoiced amount for any nonschedule item will also be subject to a 1 percent charge
to the ordering agency.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. All questions concerning invoices shall be addressed to the GSA Office of Finance (816) 926&hyph;7356. Questions
concerning purchase/delivery orders shall be directed to the agency placing the order. Questions regarding GSA
billings shall be directed to the GSA Office of Finance at (816) 926&hyph;7037. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
j. In order to facilitate processing of invoices, contractors are requested to include on the invoice the name and
phone number of a person to contract should questions arise regarding the invoice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
k. The contractor's submission of an invoice constitutes a representation that the supplies have been delivered
to a post office, common carrier, or point of first receipt by the Government; and the contractor agrees to replace,
repair, or correct supplies not received at destination, damaged in transit, or not conforming to the purchase/delivery
order. In the case of services, submission of the invoice means that required services have been satisfactorily performed.
GSA and the ordering activities reserve the right to require proof of shipment or evidence of delivery/performance
prior to payment. GSA, Office of Finance will implement a post payment satistically reliable system to validate agency
receipt of goods or services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
l. Ordering activities will continue to resolve delivery and other performance problems concerning their schedule
orders directly with the contractors. When resolution of disputes remains unresolved, ordering activities may
charge back billings to GSA. GSA will offset claims from future payments to suppliers after notification. Disputes
will continue to be resolved by the applicable GSA Contracting officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
m. Pursuant to the clause, Examination of Records by GSA (552.215&hyph;70) and FAR, Subpart 4.7, contractors are
required to retain files, records, and information relevant to this contract, including records to support/confirm
shipments, deliveries, invoices, and to verify agencies' purchase/delivery orders, for up to 3 years after final
payment, or as specified in Subpart 4.705 through 4.705&hyph;3, whichever periods expire first.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The General Services Administration, Federal Supply Service is pleased to announce the establishment of a single
payment office for receipt and payment of schedule invoices. Invoices submitted for payment for all orders issued
under this Federal Supply Schedule will no longer be paid by the individual ordering activities. Instead, GSA will
be the single payment office for all invoices submitted against contracts under this schedule. This new single payment
procedure relieves contractors of the burden of invoicing numerous billing offices, resulting in a reduction in
administrative costs for contractors. See Clause I&hyph;FSS&hyph;&blank;&blank;&blank;&blank;, Contract

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The following is a brief outline of the steps for paying and billing by the GSA Kansas City Finance Office:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Invoices with copies of purchase/delivery orders will be accepted by GSA either through Electronic Data Interchange
(EDI) or paper.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Proper invoices, with accompanying purchase/delivery orders will be entered into the Finance Information Network
(FINET) data base.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. GSA will pay proper invoices (check or electronic fund transfer (EFT), at negotiated contract terms in accordance
with the Prompt Payment Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. GSA will bill customer agencies for reimbursement. The amount billed will be the contractor's published schedule
price shown on the customer purchase/delivery order. The price published in the schedule pricelist is based on adjusting
the negotiated award price upward by 1 percent (of the awarded price.) This adjustment is accomplished by multiplying
the schedule contract price by 1.01. (See attached example).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Some data captured by GSA will be available to contractors and ordering activities via a bulletin board. such data
will include paying and billing data plus a scanned image of any paper invoice and order in the system. It will also facilitate
communication with the GSA Finance employees via electronic mail box or telephone for any other assistance needed.
Access to the system will require identification of the user by vendor Tax Identification Number (TIN), or ordering
activity paying office Activity Address Code (AAC), and a unique password.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Ordering offices will continue to resolve delivery problems directly with the contractors. When resolution of
disputes is not forthcoming, customers may charge back billings to GSA. GSA will offset claims from future payments
to suppliers after notification. Dispute will continue to be resolved by the applicable GSA contracting officers.

 This is notice, in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i), that the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services,
is contemplating the grant of a limited field of use exclusive license in the United States to practice the invention
embodied in U.S. Patent Number 5,219,991, filed on September 21, 1990, and issued on June 15, 1993, entitled ``Macrophage
Stimulating Protein'', to Toyobo Co., Ltd., having a place of business in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The patent rights
in this invention have been assigned to the United States of America. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The patent claims macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) and further relates to antibodies to MSP. It also claims a
method of purifying MSP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The prospective exclusive license will be royalty-bearing and will comply with the terms and conditions of 35 U.S.C.
209 and 37 CFR 404.7. The prospective exclusive license may be granted unless, within 60 days from the date of this published
Notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the license would not be consistent
with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The field of use would be limited to the use of MSP as an anti-fungal agent, in opportunistic infections in immunocompromised

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(11); 552a(r)), we are notifying the public of our intent
to alter an existing routine use of information maintained in four systems of records: The Claims Folder System, HHS/SSA/OP,
09&hyph;60&hyph;0089 (routine use number 24); the Earnings Recording and Self-Employment Income System, HHS/SSA/OSR,
09&hyph;60&hyph;0059 (routine use number 15); the Master Beneficiary Record, HHS/SSA/OSR, 09&hyph;60&hyph;0090
(routine use number 12); and the Master Files of Social Security Number (SSN) Holders and SSN Applications, HHS/SSA/OSR,
09&hyph;60&hyph;0058 (routine use number 19). The routine use in question presently contains identical text in
all four systems of records and the proposed modification is also identical in all four systems. A notice pertaining
to the Earnings Recording and Self-Employment Income System was last published in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Background of the Proposed Routine Use
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the past 15 years, the United States (U.S.) has established a network of bilateral Social Security agreements
that coordinate the U.S. retirement, survivors and disability insurance (RSDI) program with the comparable programs
of other countries. The agreements, commonly known in the U.S. as ``totalization'' agreements, are authorized by
section 233 of the Social Security Act. Currently, the U.S. has totalization agreements in force with 17 countries,
including Canada and virtually all of Western Europe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the main purposes of the agreements is to help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their
careers between the U.S. and another country. Such workers may fail to qualify for Social Security benefits from one
or both countries because they have not worked long enough to meet minimum eligibility requirements. Under an agreement,
these workers may qualify for partial U.S. or foreign benefits based on ``totalized'' (i.e., combined) credits from
both countries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implementing the totalization agreements has required SSA to share certain personal information in its files with
counterpart social security agencies in the other countries. Generally, this sharing has been limited to personal
information needed to adjudicate claims for benefits under the agreements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present wording of the four routine uses permits disclosure of personal Social Security records for totalization
purposes, which, as discussed above, involves adjudication of claims. Consistent with section 233 of the Social
Security Act, the contemplated revision would expand the field of allowable disclosures by permitting disclosure
of personal information in SSA's files to a foreign Social Security agency essentially for all SSA and foreign program-related
activities in the U.S. or abroad. This will, in addition to the adjudication of claims, include those instances in
which SSA and a foreign country have entered into mutual assistance arrangements under a totalization agreement.
Under a mutual assistance arrangement, the foreign country would assist SSA generally in the administration of its
programs and SSA would provide reciprocal services for the foreign country. This would include post-entitlement
reviews and redeterminations, applications for Social Security numbers, program and operational studies, integrity
reviews and evaluations, research and statistical studies, and the like. It will also include situations where information
from SSA's records is needed by a foreign Social Security agency to implement a provision of an agreement other than
adjudicating a claim for benefits. For example, a foreign agency may need information from SSA's records to determine
if, under the provisions of an agreement, a person has the right to make voluntary contributions to its Social Security
system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed revised routine use provides for disclosure:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``To the Social Security agency of a foreign country, to carry out the purpose of an international Social Security
agreement entered into between the United States and the other country, pursuant to section 233 of the Social Security
Act.''

B. Compatibility of the Proposed Routine Use
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Privacy Act permits us to disclose information about individuals without their consent for a routine use, i.e.,
when the information will be used for a purpose that is compatible with the purpose for which we collected the information.
The proposed routine use, as modified, will be compatible with the purposes for which SSA initially collected the
information to be disclosed, since, by the nature of the totalization agreements the social security agency in the
other country will be administering a program comparable to the social security program of the U.S.; the totalization
agreements will continue to require that the foreign agencies use the information only for compatible, program-related
purposes.

C. Effect of the Proposed Alteration on the Privacy of Individuals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whenever the U.S. enters into a totalization agreement with a foreign country, SSA always requires the other country's
assurance that appropriate laws of that country protect the confidentiality of personal data. SSA always considers
how compatible the other country's privacy laws are with those of the U.S.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unless the other country's laws allow disclosure, the information which SSA furnishes to a foreign country's social
security agency under a totalization agreement must be kept confidential and, to the extent possible, used exclusively
for implementing the agreement (Social Security Ruling 80&hyph;15 and 20 CFR 404.1930). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SSA uses information in these four systems for the purposes of determining age and other evidentiary requirements
of individuals applying for Social Security benefits or Social Security numbers. We will continue to adhere to all
provisions of the Privacy Act, Social Security Act, and other applicable laws in our maintenance and use of the information.
Thus, we do not anticipate that any unwarranted effects on the privacy of individuals will result from the routine
use alteration proposed in this notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure self-sustaining members
of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort
the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery
Plans describe actions necessary for the conservation of the species, establish criteria for the recovery levels
for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost for implementing the recovery measures needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation
of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that public notice, and an opportunity
for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information
presented during a public comments period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other
Federal agencies will take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Florida Manatee, a subspecies of the West Indian manatee, was originally listed under the Endangered Species
Act on March 11, 1967. The Service developed an initial recovery plan for manatees in 1980. The 1980 plan focused primarily,
but not exclusively, on manatees in Florida. In 1986 the Service adopted a separate Recovery Plan for manatees in Puerto
Rico. To reflect new information and planning needs for manatees in Florida, the Service revised the original plan
in 1989 focusing exclusively on Florida's manatees. The revised plan covered a five-year planning period ending
in Fiscal Year 1994. In view of progress since 1989 and planning needs beyond 1994, the Service is once again updating
and revising the plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
West Indian manatees are also protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1461

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). This Act establishes the objective of continued maintenance of the health and stability of marine ecosystems,
and whenever consistent with this primary objective, obtaining and maintaining optimum sustainable populations
of marine mammals. It also establishes a moratorium, with certain exceptions, on harassing, hunting, capturing,
killing, or attempting to harass, hunt, capture, or kill any marine mammal. Section 115(b) requires that conservation
plans be developed for marine mammals, including West Indian manatees, considered ``depleted'' under the Act. The
purpose of conservation plans is to identify actions needed to restore species or populations to optimum sustainable
population levels as defined under the Act. The revised recovery plan meets this planning requirement.

The Florida manatee is found primarily in coastal areas of Florida and southeast Georgia, although individuals range
seasonally westward into Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana on the Gulf coast and north through the Carolinas,
into Virginia and Chesapeake Bay along the east coast.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manatees are large aquatic herbivores that feed opportunistically on a wide variety of submerged, floating, and
emergent vegetation in marine and freshwater habitats. This includes seagrasses, emergent vascular plants, benthic
algae, and various floating plants. Shallow grass beds with ready access to deep channels are preferred feeding areas.
Manatees frequent canals, creeks, embayments, and lagoons, particularly near the mouths of coastal rivers and sloughs,
for feeding, resting, cavorting, mating, and calving.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When ambient water temperatures drop below 20 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C (68 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F) in autumn and winter, manatees aggregate at natural or artificial warm water refuges or move to southern Florida.
Most artificial refuges are created by warm water outfalls at power plants or paper mills. Large winter aggregations
of 50 or more animals occur at these sites in central and southern Florida, and several smaller aggregations with 15
or fewer animals in northern Florida and southern Georgia on the east coast. The northernmost refuge used regularly
on the west coast is at Crystal River. Most manatees utilize the same warm water refuges each year. Some individuals
use different refuges from year to year while others use two or more refuges during the same winter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During summer months, manatees may be found almost anywhere in Florida where water depths are greater than 1&hyph;2
meters. They normally occur alone or in pairs, although interacting groups of five to ten animals are not unusual (in
mating herd situations, for example).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Efforts have been made to develop a reliable estimate of manatee abundance in Florida. When conditions are favorable
a statewide aerial count of manatees at significant aggregation sites is conducted following winter cold fronts,
to assure the greatest likelihood that as many individual manatees as possible will be at these sites. The highest
single-day count of manatees from a statewide aerial survey is 1,856 animals in January 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The long-term survival of manatees in Florida is uncertain. Known mortality, which averaged over 170 animals per
year between 1988 and 1992, is more than double what it was in the late 1970s. Because of current population size estimates
and the species' relatively low reproductive rate (manatees produce only a single calf every 2.5&hyph;5 years per
mature female), present mortality may exceed the populations' ability to produce new animals. The major threats
to Florida manatees are collisions with watercraft, which account for about 25 percent of known manatee deaths in
Florida annually, and destruction and degradation of habitat caused by widespread development throughout much
of the species' Florida range.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Data on manatee mortality in the Southeastern U.S. has been collected since 1974 and indicates a clear increase in
manatee deaths over the last 15 years. Although both natural and human-related causes are significant components
of manatee mortality, most of the increase in mortality can be attributed to increases in watercraft-related deaths
and perinatal deaths.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A prominent cause of natural mortality in some years in cold stress. Following a severe winter cold spell in 1989, 46
manatee carcasses whose death was attributed to cold stress were recovered. Significant mortality from exposure
to cold also occurred in the winters of 1977, 1981, and 1984.

The revised plan is based on recommendations of the Florida Manatee Recovery Team.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``taking'' of endangered species such as the golden-cheeked warbler. However,
the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species incidental to,
and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are at
50 CFR 17.22.

Richard J. Smith plans to construct a single family residence at Lot 37, Section 4, Block D, Jester Point 2 Subdivision,
Travis County, Texas. This action will eliminate one half acre of, and indirectly impact one additional acre of golden-cheeked
warbler habitat. The applicant proposes to compensate for this incidental take of golden-cheeked warbler habitat
by placing $2,000 into the City of Austin Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Fund to acquire/manage lands for the
conservation of the golden-cheeked warbler.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives to this action were rejected because selling or not developing the subject property with federally
listed species present was not economically feasible.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``taking'' of endangered species such as the golden-cheek warbler. However, the
Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species incidental to, and
not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are at 50
CFR 17.22.

The Applicant plans to construct a single family residence at Lot 6 Lake Georgetown Estates II Subdivision, Williamson
County Texas. This action will directly eliminate less than one-half acre of and indirectly impact less than one additional
acre of golden cheeked warbler habitat. The application proposes to compensate for this incidental take of golden-cheeked
warbler habitat by placing $2,000 into the City of Austin Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Fund to acquire/manage
lands for the conservation of the golden-cheeked warbler.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant considered four alternatives but rejected three of them because they were not economically viable.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 826) requires the Attorney General to establish aggregate
production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II each year. This responsibility has been delegated
to the Administrator of the DEA pursuant to Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Administrator,
in turn, has redelegated this function to the Deputy Administrator pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 1, 1994, an interim notice establishing a revised 1994 aggregate production quota for morphine was published
in the Federal Register (59 FR 54629). All interested persons were invited to comment on or object to this proposed
aggregate production quota on or before December 1, 1994. No comments or objections were received. The interim notice
is adopted without change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notices of aggregate production quotas are not subject to
centralized review under Executive Order 12866. This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles
and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this matter does not have sufficient
federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose
interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The establishment of annual
aggregate production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law and by international
treaty obligations. While aggregate production quotas are of primary importance to large manufacturers, their
impact upon small entities is neither negative nor beneficial. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator has determined
that this action does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, under the authority vested in the Attorney General by Section 306 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970
(21 U.S.C. 826), delegated to the Administrator of the DEA by Section 0.100 of Title 28 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
and redelegated to the Deputy Administrator, pursuant to 59 FR 23637 (May 6, 1994), the Deputy Administrator hereby
orders that the 1994 revised aggregate production quota for morphine, expressed in grams of anhydrous base, be established
as follows:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that Baxter Healthcare
Corporation workers in Kingstree, South Carolina were adversely affected by increased imports of articles like
or directly competitive with the surgical gloves and medical trays produced at Baxter Healthcare Corporation in
Kingstree, South Carolina.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 28, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for workers and former workers of the subject firm. The notice was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on October 7, 1994 (59 FR 51211).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The company submitted additional information showing that it sells to dealers not end users and that it has lost market
share.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation findings show declines in sales, production and employment in fiscal year (FY) 1994 compared to FY
1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other investigation findings show that U.S. imports of packaging machinery increased absolutely and relative to
domestic shipments in 1993 compared to 1992 and in 1994 compared to 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other findings show that the workers were previously determined to be adversely impacted by imports and certified
under petition TA&hyph;W&hyph;26,423 which expired on November 25, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Findings on reconsideration show that Weldotron lost market share for its automatic sealer packaging machines to
imported automatic sealer packaging machines in 1994 compared to 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other findings on reconsideration show that several of the dealers surveyed indicated increased purchases of automatic

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the workers at Weldotron

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 7, 1994, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration
for NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance for former workers of the subject firm. This notice will soon be published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation findings show that Scab Rock Feeders, Inc., ceased operations in August 1994, when all workers were
laid off. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The workers were previously certified for trade adjustment assistance (TAA) on July 28, 1989 under petition TA&hyph;W&hyph;23,045
which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

 on August 22, 1989 (54 FR 34834). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On reconsideration, it was found that the workers were negatively impacted by imported Canadian cattle. The Canadian
government subsidizes their cattle industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New findings on reconsideration show that a major declining customer decreased its business with the subject firm
because of increased import purchases of Canadian cattle.

After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that the workers at Scab

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of the Act, I make the following revised certification for the Scab Rock Feeders,
Inc., workers in Othello, Washington.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``All workers of Scab Rock Feeders, Inc., Othello, Washington who became totally or partially separated from employment

9. Abstract: 10 CFR Parts 11 and 25 require that access authorizations expire five years from the date of issuance and
require that applications for renewals be filed with NRC at least 120 days prior to expiration. For those individuals
who have an active Department of Energy (DOE) ``Q'' or ``L'' or comparable access authorizations and who are subject
to the DOE or other Federal agency's Reinvestigation Program, the renewal paperwork submission requirement consists
of an NRC Form 237, ``Request for Access Authorization.'' The expiration date and the use of NRC Form 237 for renewal
are being eliminated for these individuals. The individual's submission of the reinvestigation application required
by DOE or other Federal agency will satisfy NRC renewal submission and paperwork requirement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR&hyph;61, issued to Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company (CYAPCO, the licensee), for operation
of the Haddam Neck Plant, located in Middlesex County, Connecticut.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Identification of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specifications (TS) 3.4.1.1, ``Reactor Coolant Loops and Coolant
Circular,'' TS 3.7.1.1., ``Safety Valves_Self Actuation Function,'' Table 3.7&hyph;1, ``Steam Line Safety Valves
Per Loop,'' and their associated Bases sections. In addition, the TS change will add a new TS 3.7.1.1.2, ``Safety Valves_Remote
Actuation Function,'' with an associated Bases change. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's
amendment request dated May 4, 1993, as supplemented August 9 and 18, 1993, January 25, April 11, and June 22, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated May 4, 1993, CYAPCO informed the staff that during the Cycle 17 refueling outage, four main steam safety
valves (MSSVs) (one per steam line) were replaced with valves that would provide remote manual operation. These valves
have dual capability, as MSSVs (self-actuating function) and as atmospheric dump valves (ADV) (remote-actuation
function). These valves will significantly increase the remote manual atmospheric steam dump capability of the
Haddam Neck Plant. To assure the remote manual operation of the new MSSVs, the licensee has proposed adding the remote
function of the MSSVs to the TS. The licensee is also removing the loop isolation valves from the TS. In addition, the
appropriate Bases sections will be modified to include a discussion of the remote actuation capability of the MSSVs
and remove the discussion regarding the use of the loop isolation valves for mitigation of a steam generator tube rupture
(SGTR) event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The TS changes, hardware modifications, and the associated analysis will change the licensing basis for mitigating
a SGTR event at the Haddam Neck Plant. The new MSSVs can be operated remotely from the main control room, as well as locally
(self-actuating) for steam generator overpressure protection. This modification provides the plant the ability
to rapidly cool down and depressurize without reliance on the main condensor or other nonsafety-related balance
of plant equipment. The plant will now mitigate a SGTR event with the use of the MSSVs as remote ADV rather than the loop
isolation valves. The use of ADVs to limit break flow for a SGTR event is consistent with most other Westinghouse PWR
plants. The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed TS changes and concludes that the new MSSVs still
meet the original design (self-actuating function) and can also be used as atmospheric steam dump valves (remote-actuation
function). The proposed TS changes will provide assurance of the operability of both functions. The removal of the
loop isolation valves are acceptable because the licensee has demonstrated that SGTR events will now be mitigated
with the use of the MSSVs as ADVs rather than the loop isolation valves. The Updated Final Safety Analysis Report will
be revised to reflect the change in the licensing basis associated with the mitigation of a SGTR event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed TS change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in
the types of any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual
or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant
radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed TS amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendment involves features located entirely within
the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other
environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed amendment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed amendment,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the amendment would be to deny the amendment request. Such action would not enhance the protection of the environment.

Alternative Use of Resources
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action does not involve the use of resources not considered previously in the Final Environmental Statement
for the Haddam Neck Plant.

Agencies and Persons Consulted
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff consulted with the Connecticut State official regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.
The State official had no comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the proposed action, see the licensee's letter dated May 4, 1993, as supplemented
August 9, and 18, 1993, January 25, April 11, and June 22, 1994, which are available for public inspection at the Commission's
Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the local public document room

<DOCTITLE>Arizona Public Service Company, et al.; Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1, 2, and 3; Receipt of Petition
for Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that by petition dated November 14, 1994, Florida Energy Consultants, Inc. (FEC) and Linda
E. Mitchell (petitioners), in a petition signed by Mr. Thomas J. Saporito, Jr., request that they be granted (1) an
administrative public hearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Atomic Safety and Licensing Board
(Board) and (2) leave to intervene in such a hearing. The petitioners also request that the NRC (3) issue a confirmatory
order requiring the Arizona Public Service Company, et al. (licensee) to immediately bring all three units at the
Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station to 0 percent power until such time as the licensee can demonstrate corrective
actions obviating any inference of a hostile work environment and (4) issue a demand for information (DFI) to the licensee
seeking an explanation as to why the NRC can have confidence that the licensee will ensure that an environment exists
free of harassment, intimidation, and discrimination, both in general throughout its organization and in particular
with respect to certain named individuals. In addition, with respect to these individuals, the NRC interprets the
petition as also requesting that the NRC require the licensee to provide (5) a description of these individuals' current
employment duties and responsibilities, (6) an explanation as to why the NRC can have confidence that these individuals
will comply with NRC requirements, (7) information as to why the Commission should not take action to prohibit these
individuals from being involved in NRC-licensed activities, (8) information as to why the NRC should have reasonable
assurance that these individuals will abide by NRC regulations that protect individuals who engage in protected
activities, and (9) any other information the licensee believes to be relevant to the Commission's decision in this
matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners assert as a basis for their requests that the licensee has been the subject of numerous complaints
filed under the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 and adjudicated by the Department of Labor under the employee protection
provisions found in 29 CFR part 24. In addition, the petitioners assert that a hostile work environment is pervasive
and encompasses all three units at Palo Verde, as well as being condoned and fostered by license management to dissuade
employees at Palo Verde from identifying safety concerns internally or directly to NRC representatives. The petitioners
also assert that they are subject to physical harm and the loss of personal property should Palo Verde experience a
nuclear accident as a direct or indirect result of the hostile work environment at this facility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioners' current requests are similar to those in a petition dated May 12, 1993, as supplemented on May 28,
1993, in which Mr. Saporito requested that the NRC institute a proceeding pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202 to modify, suspend,
or revoke the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station operating licenses; initiate actions to immediately shut down
the three nuclear reactors at Palo Verde; take escalated enforcement action against the licensee and/or licensee
management personnel; and take immediate actions to cause an exhaustive survey of licensee employees at Palo Verde
to ascertain the scope and breadth of any chilling effect that may exist at the nuclear station and to discover if licensee
management actions, if any, were effective in limiting any chilling effect at the nuclear station. In addition, the
bases for the petitioners' current requests are similar to those in Mr. Saporito's request of May 12, 1993. Mr. Saporito
asserted as bases for his prior requests, in part, that the licensee had violated 10 CFR 50.7, ``Employee Protection'';
alleged that the licensee had a reputation for leading the nation in whistleblower complaints; pointed to the Department
of Labor discrimination cases involving licensee employees, Linda Mitchell and Sarah Thomas, and the resulting
issuance by the NRC of a notice of violation and proposed imposition of civil penalties on September 20, 1992; and asserted
continuing discrimination by the licensee against the petitioner in denying him employment at the Palo Verde Nuclear
Generating Station. Since the requests of May 12, 1993, and November 14, 1994, are similar, the staff is addressing
the current petition together with the petition of May 12, 1993, as supplemented, for purposes of preparing a director's
decision. The petition has been referred to the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206. As provided
by Section 2.206, appropriate action will be taken with regard to the specific issues raised by the petition in a reasonable
time.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, has taken action with respect to two related Petitions filed
by Paul M. Blanch. Notice is hereby given that by letter dated December 31, 1992, Mr. Blanch requested that the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (Commission) impose immediate enforcement action against Rosemount Nuclear Instruments,
Incorporated for a knowing and intentional failure to submit, as required by 10 CFR Part 21, a notice to the Commission
that ``basic components supplied'' to its customers ``contained defects,'' as defined by 10 CFR &sect;21.3. In a
second letter dated March 28, 1994, the Petitioner requested the Commission to inform all users of Rosemount 1150-series
pressure transmitters and trip units of ``significant safety problems'' identified in Commission Inspection Report
99900271/93&hyph;01, and that the Commission take ``prompt and vigorous'' enforcement action against Rosemount
for careless disregard of the reporting requirements of 10 CFR Part 21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) has granted these Petitions in part and denied them
in part. The reasons for the Director's actions are set forth in the ``Director's Decision under 10 CFR &sect;2.206''
(DD&hyph;94&hyph;12), which is available for public inspection in the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120
L Street, NW. (Lower Level), Washington, DC 20555&hyph;0001.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the Director's Decision will be filed with the Secretary for the Commission's review in accordance with 10
CFR &sect;2.206(c) of the Commission's regulations. As provided by that regulation, the Decision will constitute
the final action of the Commission 25 days after the date of issuance of the Decision unless the Commission on its own
motion institutes a review of the Decision within that time.

I. Introduction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 31, 1992, Mr. Paul M. Blanch (the Petitioner) filed a Petition with the Executive Director for Operations,
pursuant to Section 2.206 of Title 10 of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Code of Federal Regulations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 (10 CFR 2.206), in which he requested that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) impose immediate enforcement
action against Rosemount for a knowing and intentional failure to submit, as required by 10 CFR Part 21, a notice to
the Commission that ``basic components supplied'' to its customers ``contained defects,'' as defined by 10 CFR 21.3.
On March 2, 1993, the Petitioner sent a letter to the NRC in which he stated, in part, that he ``was requesting enforcement
action against Rosemount for failing to report defects as required by 10 CFR 21,'' and making ``a simple request that
[the NRC] investigate a potential cover-up and a failure to report a defect in accordance with the requirements of
10 CFR 21.'' On March 28, 1994, the Petitioner filed a second Petition in which he requested that the NRC inform all users
of Rosemount 1150-series pressure transmitters and series 510 and 710 DU trip devices of ``significant safety problems''
identified in NRC Inspection Report 99900271/93&hyph;01 (which addressed principally the NRC staff inspection
of Rosemount's 10 CFR Part 21 and Appendix B to 10 CFR Part 50 established programs), and that the NRC take ``prompt and
vigorous'' enforcement action against Rosemount for careless disregard of the reporting requirements of 10 CFR
Part 21. In a letter dated May 2, 1994, the Petitioner reiterated his request that the NRC take action to inform all users
of Rosemount 1150-series pressure transmitters and series 510 and 710 DU trip devices of the ``significant safety
problems'' identified in NRC Inspection Report 99900271/93&hyph;01,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letters dated February 2 and April 7, 1993, in response to the Petition of December 31, 1992, and letter of March 2,
1993, the NRC staff stated that the request for immediate action was denied because the actions it had already taken
to address the problems with Rosemount transmitters were sufficient to ensure that the problems did not constitute
an immediate safety concern for any nuclear power plant. The NRC staff also stated in those letters that, as provided
by 10 CFR 2.206, action would be taken on the Petition within reasonable time. By letters dated April 25 and June 3, 1994,
in response to the Petitioner's letters of March 28 and May 2, 1994, the NRC staff stated that the NRC inspection report
was included in the April 1994 publication of NUREG&hyph;0040,
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 ``which is sent to all nuclear power plant licensees,''
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 and that none of the identified issues were considered significant enough to warrant immediate notification of the
nuclear industry.

NUREG&hyph;0040, ``Licensee Contractor and Vendor Inspection Status Report,'' is distributed to NRC licensed
facilities, manufacturers, suppliers, architect engineer firms, nuclear steam supply system suppliers and is
publicly available at NRC public document rooms, National Technical Information Services (NTIS) and through the
Government Printing Office (GPO) sales office.

Subsequently, NRC staff identified the NUREG&hyph;0040 was not distributed to ``all nuclear power plant licensees''
as stated to the Petitioner by letter dated April 25, 1994, because of an NRC staff error that was made concerning the
NUREG&hyph;0040 distribution process. Therefore, the NRC staff directed in October 1994 that Inspection Report
99900271/93&hyph;01 be sent to all power reactor licensees and construction permit holders. NRC staff has verified
that the distribution of the inspection reports was completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In regard to the Petitioner's second request,``to take prompt and vigorous enforcement action against Rosemount
for careless disregard of 10 CFR Part 21 requirements,'' the Petitioner was informed in the April 25, 1994, letter,
that ``[t]he NRC will make its determination as to enforcement action, [against Rosemount] should such enforcement
action be warranted, following the enforcement conference.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) has granted these Petitions in part. Specifically,
pursuant to the ``General Statement of Policy and Procedure for NRC Enforcement Actions'' (Enforcement Policy),
10 CFR Part 2, Appendix C, a Severity Level II notice of violation was issued to Rosemount on November 15, 1994. On the
basis of the conclusions and findings in NRC Office of Investigations (OI) Investigation Report 4&hyph;90&hyph;009,
dated November 12, 1993, in NRC Inspection Report 99900271/93&hyph;01, and NRC staff deliberations on a Rosemount
presentation of its relevant information regarding the Rosemount pressure transmitter sensor cell oil-loss problem
during the enforcement conference on June 23, 1994, the NRC staff concluded that Rosemount acted in careless disregard
of 10 CFR Part 21 requirements and its own procedures by failing to adequately evaluate or to inform its customers of
the potential for degraded transmitter operation as a result of the oil-loss problem.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Additionally, on October 11, 1994, the NRC staff received an unsolicited letter from Rosemount, dated September
28, 1994. In this letter, Rosemount stated that it agreed with the NRC ``views'' expressed at the June 23, 1994, enforcement
conference on the importance of 10 CFR Part 21. However, Rosemount stated that it could not concur in the view that Rosemount
acted in careless disregard of NRC requirements by failing to adequately identify and report potential defects in
its Model 1153 pressure transmitters prior to December 1988. Rosemount attached a 40 page enclosure to its letter
that takes exception to a number of statements and conclusions delineated in the NRC inspection report. These exceptions
included Rosemount's position that early (1984) transmitter failure mechanisms were never established as resulting
from oil loss, and the oil loss problem could have resulted from other factors unrelated to transmitter design. Rosemount
additionally disagreed with the position in the inspection report that early non-nuclear grade Model 1151 transmitter
failures should have made Rosemount aware of a potentially generic problem affecting its nuclear grade transmitters.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Further, Rosemount disagreed with the portion of the inspection report that identifies the time that Rosemount began
to track field returns of failed transmitters.

During this particular period of time, the sensor cell for both Model 1151, non-nuclear grade transmitters, and Models
1152 and 1153, nuclear grade transmitters, were manufactured in the same production line, utilizing the same manufacturing
and production line process controls.

The staff reviewed the information in the Rosemount letter and determined that the letter did not provide new information
or arguments that would cause any change in the staff's position. The inspection report and the OI investigation identified
numerous instances where problems with transmitters implicating the transmitter design, manufacturing or test
processes were brought to Rosemount's attention but were not properly addressed by Rosemount for their generic or
common-mode failure implications. The staff concluded that Rosemount failed to address these generic or common-mode
failure implications, initially because it improperly dispositioned the failures as random rather than using available
information to identify deviations that clearly, in the staff's view, represented a common mode failure potential.
Despite having, as the OI investigation identified multiple examples of transmitter failures and several members
of the Rosemount staff convinced that the failures were a result of manufacturing problems common to all the transmitter
sensor cells, Rosemount failed to inform NRC licensees of the deviation.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The staff concluded that Rosemount's knowledge of this deviation, coupled with its failure to inform licensees,
constituted careless disregard for the requirements of 10 CFR Part 21.

As defined in 10 CFR 21.3, deviation means a departure from the technical requirements included in a procurement document.
The identified oil-loss problem was considered a deviation because sensor cell oil-loss caused Rosemount transmitters
to depart from technical performance specifications that were delineated in Rosemount product data sheets.

II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the mid-1980s, the NRC staff had been aware of several potential problems with Rosemount Models 1152, 1153,
and 1154 transmitters (1150-series transmitters). In 1987, the NRC conducted an inspection at Rosemount because
of a potential generic problem concerning degraded transmitter operation associated with contaminants in sensor
cell oil, a condition referred to as ``latch-up'' identified in the early 1980s. During the same period that Rosemount
was trying to resolve the latch-up problem, another sensor cell related problem was identified that also caused degraded
transmitter operation. The second problem involved transmitter sensor cell oil-loss, which was not readily detectable
because the sensor cell was sealed inside the transmitter. Rosemount pressure transmitter sensor cell oil-loss
problems in nuclear applications occurred in a number of instances and at varying frequencies from 1984 on, indicating
a potential generic problem with the transmitters. Rosemount nevertheless treated each licensee or Rosemount-identified
oil-loss problem as an isolated occurrence, and handled the problems essentially on an individual basis as they arose.
Although Rosemount indicated to the NRC staff and licensees that the failures resulting from oil loss appeared to
be random and unrelated to any generic problem with Rosemount 1150-series transmitters, the staff nevertheless
issued NRC Information Notice 89&hyph;42, ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Failure of Rosemount Models 1153 and 1154 Transmitters,''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 21, 1989, to alert licensees to this potentially generic problem. On May 10, 1989, Rosemount issued the first
of four technical bulletins in which it discussed loss of oil in its pressure transmitters. The NRC staff continued
to monitor the oil-loss problem and discuss the potentially generic problem with Rosemount and the industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff remained concerned that the transmitter oil-loss problem did not appear to be isolated, as Rosemount
had been informing licensees. Therefore, on March 9, 1990, it issued Bulletin 90&hyph;01, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
``Loss of Fill-Oil in Transmitters Manufactured by Rosemount,''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 to ensure that all licensees were adequately informed about the problem and would take appropriate corrective action.
After obtaining additional information, the staff issued 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
Supplement 1 to Bulletin 90&hyph;01
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 22, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In February and March 1993, NRC staff performed an inspection at Rosemount. On March 4, 1994, the staff issued Inspection
Report 99900271/93&hyph;01, in which it identified an apparent violation of 10 CFR Part 21 regarding the transmitted
oil-loss problem and asked Rosemount to participate in an enforcement conference on the matter. In the report, the
staff also identified several other violations of 10 CFR Part 21 and several nonconformances regarding Appendix
B to 10 CFR Part 50. On June 23, 1994, an enforcement conference was held at NRC headquarters in Rockville, Maryland.

III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the evidence developed during the investigation, OI determined that two allegations were partially
substantiated. Regarding the first partially substantiated allegation, OI determined that Rosemount presented
incomplete and inaccurate information to the NRC during a public meeting on April 13, 1989. However, the evidence
developed during OI's investigation did not substantiate that this presentation of incomplete and inaccurate information
was deliberate. Although the NRC staff recognized that the inaccurate and incomplete statements made to the NRC during
the public meeting on April 13, 1989, were not deliberate, it had substantial concerns about this matter and emphasized
to Rosemount in the letter of November 15, 1994, that the submittal of inaccurate or incomplete information to the
NRC is unacceptable and that the NRC expects all licensee and vendor communications to be complete and accurate and
to properly reflect situations that could have implications for public health and safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the second partially substantiated allegation, OI determined that Rosemount acted with careless disregard
when, in violation of 10 CFR Part 21, it failed to adequately identify and report a deviation regarding sensor cell
oil-loss that was known to Rosemount staff and to inform its customers of the problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This violation was of concern because Rosemount did not fulfill its basic 10 CFR 21.21 responsibility of ``informing
the licensee or purchaser of the [transmitter oil-loss] deviation in order that the licensee or purchaser may cause
the deviation to be evaluated unless the deviation has been corrected.'' Rosemount was aware that its manufacturing
processes and testing were causing and allowing slow leaking sensor cells to be used in nuclear transmitters, but
Rosemount did not apprise NRC licensees of those circumstances. Although the different causes of the oil-loss problem
were known to the Rosemount staff, that information was not accurately or completely transmitted to individual licensees
for their use in performing an evaluation pursuant to Part 21. As a result, the licensee Part 21 evaluations that were
performed with the information which was provided to them by Rosemount did not encompass all of the known circumstances
surrounding the oil-loss problem. The objective evidence indicated that Rosemount field service staff became concerned
after the discovery of several transmitters with degraded operation that exhibited oil-loss at one NRC-licensed
facility in 1984. Additional instances of oil-loss in the nuclear transmitters continued to be documented by Rosemount
between 1984 and 1988. It appeared to the NRC staff that Rosemount's emphasis was on correcting the manufacturing
and testing weaknesses which allowed degraded transmitter operation due to oil-loss without much consideration
of candidly informing NRC licensees of the potential for degraded operation of Rosemount transmitters installed
in safety-related applications at NRC licensed operating nuclear power plants. Between 1984 and 1988, Rosemount
received many of the failed units from its nuclear customers, performed failure analyses, and determined that the
degraded operation of these units was caused from sensor cell oil-loss. Despite these numerous indications of potential
problems with the Rosemount Models 1152, 1153 and 1154 transmitters, Rosemount failed to comply with 10 CFR Part 21
requirements and its own internal policy and procedure and inform its customers of the potential problem in a timely
fashion. The NRC inspectors concluded, partly on the basis of Rosemount internal memoranda, discussions with past
and present Rosemount staff and correspondence between Rosemount and licensees, that weaknesses in Rosemount's
10 CFR Part 50, Appendix B, quality assurance (QA) program and the reluctance of Rosemount managers to be candid in
their communications with customers contributed to Rosemount's failure to promptly inform customers of the oil-loss
problem. If Rosemount had established effective measures to ensure that conditions adverse to quality, such as failures,
malfunctions, deficiencies, deviations and nonconformances, were promptly identified and corrected, Rosemount
management could have seen the developing trend of degraded transmitter response caused by inadequate or inconsistent
controls over the sensor cell manufacturing process. Rosemount did not begin to inform its nuclear power plant customers,
as required by 10 CFR Part 21 and its own procedures, of the deviation regarding the oil-loss problem until December
1988. The NRC staff believes that Rosemount's failure to take action between 1984 and 1988_as a result of its failure
to avail itself of the multiple opportunities to recognize the generic implications of sensor cell oil-loss in its
1150-series transmitters, repeated failure to recognize the problems identified by experienced Rosemount personnel,
and the reluctance of Rosemount personnel to allow candid communications with customers of the circumstances surrounding
the deviations_reflects careless disregard of the requirements of 10 CFR Part 21.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the NRC staff concluded that the failure of Rosemount to provide timely and complete notification of NRC
licensees in the more than four years that the company was aware, or should have been aware, of the problem indicates
a careless disregard of the reporting requirements of 10 CFR Part 21. In accordance with the Enforcement Policy, Supplement
VII, Section C.5, the failure either to perform an adequate Part 21 review or to inform Rosemount customers about the
problem would be classified as a Severity Level III violation. However, in accordance with Section IV.C of the Enforcement
Policy, the severity level was increased to Severity Level II because of the careless disregard of 10 CFR Part 21 by
the Rosemount nuclear department management between 1984 and 1988. No civil penalty was proposed because the staff
had not found that the requirements of 10 CFR 21.61 for issuance of a civil penalty_that a director or other responsible
officer knowingly and consciously failed to provide the notice required by 10 CFR 21.21_have been met in this case.

Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation (NMPC or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License No. DPR&hyph;63,
which authorizes operation of Nine Mile Point Nuclear Station Unit No. 1 (the facility or NMP1), at a steady-state
reactor power level not in excess of 1850 megawatts thermal. The facility is a boiling water reactor located at the
licensee's site in Oswego County, New York. The license provides among other things, that it is subject to all rules,
regulations, and Orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission or NRC) now or hereafter in effect.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section III.D.1.(a) of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 requires the performance of three Type A containment leakage rate
tests, at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service period of the primary containment. The third
test of each set shall be conducted when the plant is shutdown for the 10-year inservice inspection of the primary containment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated August 26, 1994, NMPC requested temporary relief from the requirement to perform a set of three Type
A tests at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service period of the primary containment. The requested
exemption would permit a one-time extension of the second 10-year service period of approximately 24 months (from
the 1995 refueling outage, currently scheduled to begin in February 1995, to the 1997 refueling outage). The requested
temporary relief would permit the third test of the containment's second 10-year inservice inspection period to
correspond with the end of the current American Society of Mechanical Engineers Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME
Code) inservice inspection interval.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section III.D.1.(a) of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50 states that a set of three Type A leakage rate tests shall be performed
at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year service period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement to perform a set of three Type A leakage rate tests at approximately equal intervals during each 10-year
containment service period provides assurance that the containment is leak tight. Type A leakage rate tests were
performed as required by Appendix J during the first 10-year containment service period (1974&hyph;1984). The second
10-year containment service period is scheduled to end in December 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to a lengthy outage for the replacement of reactor recirculation piping, the first ASME Code required Inservice
Inspection (ISI) 10-year interval was extended to June 1986. An extended refueling outage (January 1987 to July 1990)
resulted in the second 10-year ISI interval being extended to December 1998. These extensions were made in accordance
with the provisions of Section XI of the ASME Code and have resulted in the ISI intervals being decoupled from the Type
A leakage test intervals since Appendix J does not contain any provisions for adjusting the 10-year intervals as does
the ASME Code for extended outages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two Type A tests have already been performed (May 1990 and April 1993) during the second 10-year containment service
interval. Since this second interval is scheduled to end in December 1994, the third test would be required during
the next refueling outage (February 1995). However, in an attempt to recouple the schedule for the Type A tests with
the ISI schedule and to avoid performing an additional Type A test, the license has proposed to extend the third Type
A test of the second interval until the 1997 refueling outage and to perform the final tests of the second ISI interval
at that time. This action would eliminate the need to perform an extra Type A test which could otherwise be required
(one test in 1995 and another in 1997) while recoupling the Type A test schedule with the ISI schedule.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined that pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(1) this exemption is authorized by law, will not present
an undue risk to the public health and safety, and is consistent with the common defense and security. The Commission
further determines that special circumstances, as provided in 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), are present justifying the
exemption; namely, that application of the regulation in the particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve
the underlying purpose of the rule. The underlying purpose of Section III.D.1.(a) of the Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50
is to provide an interval short enough to prevent serious deterioration from occurring between tests and long enough
to permit testing to be performed during regular plant outages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last Type A test was performed in April 1993. Performance of another Type A test in February 1995 would result in
a test interval of only 22 months. Whereas if the 10-year interval was equally divided into three intervals, each test
interval would be 40 months. Delaying the next Type A test until the 1997 refueling outage would result in a test interval
of approximately 46 months since NMP1 is currently operating on a 24-month fuel cycle. The 46-month test interval
would be consistent with the NRC staff's current position (as reflected in the NRC's Standard Technical Specifications)
that Type A test intervals should be 40

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 10 months. Furthermore, the licensee has presented the following information which gives a high degree of confidence
that the containment will not degrade to an unacceptable extent while this exemption is in effect:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The two most recent Type A test data show that the ``as left'' leakage rates (0.463% wt/day and 0.4634% wt/day, respectively)
were well within the acceptance limit of 0.75 Lt (0.892% wt/day).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. There have been no permanent or temporary modifications to the containment structure, liner, or penetrations
since the last Type A test that could adversely affect the Type A test results.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. No modifications that require a Type A test are planned prior to the 1997 refueling outage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There have been no pressure or temperature excursions in the containment which could have adversely affected containment
integrity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that granting this Exemption will not have a significant impact
on the environment (59 FR 62752).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This Exemption is effective upon issuance and shall expire at the completion of the 1997 refueling outage.

Summary:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The President's Council on Sustainable Development, a partnership of industry, government, and environmental,
labor, and civil rights organizations, will convene its seventh meeting in Washington, DC. Council members will
further discuss PCSD's role in developing recommendations to the President toward the integration of environmental
and economic policy and, ultimately, establishing a long-term path toward a sustainable United States by the year
2040. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council will revisit the problem statement, in terms of achieving a sustainable future_identifying what types
of practices the United States has employed that have taken us down a path of unsustainability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Council members will discuss at length draft goals for a sustainable future, which have been developed by each of the
PCSD's task force_Eco-Efficiency; Energy and Transportation; Natural Resources Management and Protection; Population
and Consumption; Public Linkage, Dialogue, and Education; Sustainable Agriculture; and Sustainable Communities.
The task forces have generated these goals based on information gleaned from programs, initiatives, and efforts
currently occurring around the United States and observations of what business and manufacturing practices are
sustainable. The Council will also engage in spirited debate about the economic incentives for developing and maintaining
ecologically-sound business and manufacturing practices.

II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1988, the Commission adopted Rule 19c&hyph;4, the Shareholder Disenfranchisement Rule, in response to concerns
that had been raised regarding the practice by some companies of restricting the voting rights of existing shareholders
through the issuance of shares with multiple, low or no voting rights.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 Generally, Rule 19c&hyph;4 prohibited self regulatory organizations (``SROs'') from listing on an exchange or
quoting on an interdealer quotation system an issuer's securities if the issuer had issued securities or taken other
corporate action that had the effect of nullifying, restricting, or disparately reducing the voting rights of existing
common shareholders. Rule 19c&hyph;4 also specified certain transactions that were deemed non-disenfranchising
to existing shareholders. In 1990, in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated the Commission's rule on grounds that the basis on which the Commission
had adopted the rule was beyond the scope of the Commission's regulatory authority.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 The court, however, did not address other statutory provisions on which the Commission had not relied, but that might
provide a basis for promulgating similar regulation.

 market participants, the Commission, and Congress have encouraged the exchanges and the NASD to formulate their

Commission approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. Although based upon the similar in many respects to former
SEC Rule 19c&hyph;4, the Policy is more flexible and seeks to accommodate shareholder protection concerns with the
needs and changing circumstances of capital markets and issuers.

III. Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SROs are proposing to adopt a minimum voting rights rule that would prohibit continued listing on the NYSE or Amex,
or inclusion in the Nasdaq System, of companies that disenfranchise shareholders of public common stock.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rule states that:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Specifically: (1) the NYSE is proposing to amend its Listed Company Manual; (2) the Amex is proposing to amend its Company
Guide with respect to common stock voting rights in general as well as that portion applicable to its Emerging Company
Marketplace (``ECM''); and (3) the NASD is proposing to adopt a voting rights rule for the Small Cap Nasdaq segment
of the Nasdaq System and to adopt an interpretive policy to be applicable to the voting rights rules in the Nasdaq National
Market System (``NMS'') segment and the Small Cap Nasdaq segment of the Nasdaq System. The NMS segment currently has
a voting rights rule that mirrors the language of former Rule 19c&hyph;4. By adopting the proposed Policy, the NASD
will acquire more flexibility in interpreting voting rights issues for Nasdaq NMS companies and create minimum voting
rights standards throughout the Nasdaq System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Voting rights of existing shareholders of publicly traded common stock registered under Section 12 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 cannot be disparately reduced or restricted through any corporate action or issuance of stock.
Examples of such corporate action or issuance include, but are not limited to, the adoption of time-phased voting
plans, the adoption of capped voting rights plans, the issuance of super voting stock, or the issuance of stock with
voting rights less than the per share voting rights of the common stock through an exchange offer.

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Policy also contains additional guidelines as well as extensive interpretive language to supplement and clarify
the application of the Policy to, among other things, (1) issuers with existing dual class structures; (2) review
of past voting rights activities; and (3) foreign issuers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Policy specifies that the restriction against the issuance of super voting stock is primarily intended to apply
to the issuance of a new class of super voting stock. Companies with existing dual class capital structures generally
will be permitted to issue additional shares of a class of existing super voting stock consistent with the Policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, under the Policy, the SROs will continue to permit corporate actions or issuances that would have been
permitted under former Rule 19c&hyph;4. In evaluating other forms of actions or issuances, the SROs will consider,
among other things, the economics of the transaction and the voting rights being granted. The SROs intend to be flexible
in their interpretations under the Policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the Policy encourages issuers to consult with their respective SROs prior to engaging in any action or committing
to take any action that may be inconsistent with the Policy. While the Policy will continue to permit actions previously
permitted under former Rule 19c&hyph;4, issuers are urged not to assume, without first discussing the matter with
their respective SRO staff, that a particular issuance of common or preferred stock or the taking of some other corporate
action necessarily will be consistent with the Policy. The SROs also suggest that copies of preliminary proxy or other
material concerning matters subject to the Policy be furnished to the appropriate SRO for review prior to formal filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionaly, the Policy provides for a review procedure for companies that apply to list on the NYSE or Amex, or to be
included in the Nasdaq System. Under the procedure, the applicable SRO will review the issuer's past voting rights
actions to determine whether another SRO has (1) found any of the issuer's actions to have been a violation or evasion
of that SRO's voting rights policy, or (2) been approached by the issuer for a ruling or interpretation regarding the
application of that SRO's voting rights policy with respect to a proposed transaction. Based on the above, the SRO
may take any action it findings appropriate in assessing the issuer's listing application.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, it will consider any such prior interpretations issued by other SROs in response to any request by the issuer
on the same or similar transaction in making its own determination.

Such action includes, but is not limited to, the denial of the listing or the placing of restrictions on such listing.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Policy exempts issuances or actions by non-U.S. companies. Specifically, the SROs will accept any action
or issuance relating to the voting rights structure of a foreign company that is either (1) in compliance with the SRO's
requirements for domestic companies, or (2) not prohibited by the company's home country law. This is consistent
with past SRO action acknowledging the need for separate treatment of foreign issuers under their qualitative listing
standards.

B. Interpretation of the Policy: Presumptively Permitted Transactions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Former Rule 19c&hyph;4 enumerated certain corporate actions that presumptively were not disenfranchising, but
nevertheless affected shareholder voting rights.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Actions presumptively permitted under former Rule 19c&hyph;4 will continue to be presumptively permitted under
the Policy. In addition to these specific provisions of former Rule 19c&hyph;4, in the release adopting Rule 19c&hyph;4
the Commission specified that the rule would not apply in certain circumstances. As discussed below, these actions
also will be permitted under the Policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
These corporate actions include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Initial Public Offerings (``IPO'');
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Issuances of lower vote stock;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Issuances of securities to effect a bona fide merger or acquisition with voting rights not greater than the per
share voting rights of any outstanding class of the common stock of the issuer; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Actions taken pursuant to state control share acquisition statutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Initial Public Offerings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Policy, companies can issue dual classes of stock with unequal voting rights in an initial public offering
and thereafter issue additional shares of those classes.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the issuance of disparate voting rights stock pursuant to an IPO is not a disenfranchising action because
there are no existing public shareholders that are being affected by the transaction. For example, a company could
offer Class 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, lower voting stock, and Class 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, higher voting stock, to the public in an initial public offering. Under the Policy, additional issuances of Class

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, super voting stock, could be issued in the future because the dual class structure resulted from the IPO. The issuances
could be made without additional issuances of Class 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 stock. In contrast, if a company offers only Class 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 stock to the public in an initial public offering it could not subsequently issue a new Class 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
B
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 super voting stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
13
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The term ``initial public offering'' is intended to mean the offering of securities by a company by which it goes public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Lower Voting Stock
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Policy, a company that already has gone public may issue a new class of lower voting rights stock.
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Although former Rule 19c&hyph;4 permitted new lower vote issuances, the Policy will provide an issuer with additional
flexibility to issue ``regular vote'' stock following the issuance of lower voting stock. Specifically, the Policy
will permit such issuances because shareholders purchasing a new issue of lower voting stock are fully aware of the
limits on their voting power, both individually and collectively, at the time of purchase. Similarly, existing shareholders
of lower voting stock are cognizant of the possibility that their voting power may decrease through subsequent issuances
of regular or lower voting stock. By restricting subsequent offerings to equal or lesser voting stock,
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 no existing individual or class of shareholder is disenfranchised by this form of capitalization. Thus, under the
Policy, an issuer may continue to issue new classes of lower voting stock (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, stock with 1/2 vote per share followed by 1/4 vote per share, and so on).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Lower vote stock has voting rights less than the per share voting rights of any outstanding class of the common stock
of the issuer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As indicated earlier, a company with an existing structure composed in part of super voting stock, may continue to
issue additional shares of the super voting stock without being in violation of the Policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Policy, however, will clearly prohibit the issuance of a new class of stock with voting rights greater than the
outstanding existing classes. For example, a company with a one vote class and 1/2 vote class could not later issue
a new class of super voting stock with votes higher than the one vote class. There are certain limited situations, however,
where a company with multiple classes may be able to issue a new class of stock with voting rights higher than one of the
existing classes. For example, a company with classes of one vote and 1/4 vote stock outstanding may be able to issue
a new class with 1/2 vote stock even if it was not part of its original capital structure. The SROs should analyze such
issuances on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration the information disclosed to shareholders in the creation
of the existing outstanding classes, the purposes and economics of the issuance of the new class of stock, and the disenfranchising
effect on each outstanding class.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notwithstanding the above, there are certain issuances of lower voting stock that would clearly violate the Policy
because they are constructed in a manner to disenfranchise shareholders. For example, if a company issued lower voting
stock with a divided sweetener in exchange for stock of an outstanding class with higher votes but lower dividends,
this exchange offering would be violative of the Policy. Thus, the SROs will review issuances of new classes of lower
voting stock to determine if they are consistent with the Policy.

3. Bona Fide Mergers and Acquisitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The issuance of lower voting rights stock in connection with a business combination to effect a bona fide merger or
acquisition, in which the voting rights of the securities issued would not be greater than the voting rights of any
existing class of common stock, will be presumed to be accepted under the Policy. For example, when the lower voting
rights stock is structured so that dividends or other substantive rights (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, election of directors) are based on the assets or performance of the acquired company, such a recapitalization generally
should be considered bona fide and consistent with the purposes of the Policy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
A merger or combination between a company with a disparate voting rights plan and a company with a one-share, one-vote
capitalization would be scrutinized to ensure that it is being effected for a bona fide business purpose.

4. Application of the Policy to Control Share Acquisition Statutes and Other Takeover Defenses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Policy will not apply to corporate action taken pursuant to state law requiring a state's domestic corporation
to condition the voting rights of a beneficial or record holder of a specified threshold percentage of the corporation's
voting stock on the approval of the corporation's independent shareholders. These statutes generally are referred
to as state ``control share acquisition statutes.'' They are designed to prevent unwanted acquisitions of the corporations
by limiting the voting rights of large shareholders, unless specifically approved by the disinterested shareholders
or unless the corporation amends its articles of incorporation or by-laws to opt out of the statute.

In addition, the Policy will continue to permit issuers to take corporate action pursuant to other shareholder rights
plans such as ``poison pills''
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 and ``lock-ups.''
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Shareholder rights plans usually are adopted by corporations to discourage tender offers, or to encourage the development
of an auction for the company resulting in shareholders receiving a higher price for their stock. They are not adopted
to disenfranchise an existing class or classes of shareholders.

Use of a ``poison pill'' is a strategy, generally employed by a potential takeover-target company, to make acquisition
of its stock more costly to an acquirer. For instance, a firm may issue a new series of preferred stock that provides
shareholders the right to redeem it at a premium price after a takeover. Such measures raise the cost of an acquisition,
and cause dilution, hopefully deterring a takeover bid.

A ``lock-up'' is a privilege offered to a friendly acquirer by a target company of buying the target's most valuable
assets or additional equity, often at a discount. The aim is to discourage a hostile takeover by granting such an option
to a friendly acquirer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Similarly, lock-up options or agreements generally are utilized by a corporation as a defensive tactic and entered
into with a friendly potential acquirer often referred to as a ``white knight.'' Nevertheless, lock-up effected
by the sale of a new class of super voting preferred stock generally would be prohibited under the Policy because they
would involve an issuance of a new class of super voting stock. Accordingly, the SROs will have the flexibility to analyze
the facts of each lock-up option or poison pill on a case-by-case basis for consistency with the Policy.

For example, if the issuer's existing capital structure included the super voting class being issued pursuant to

the Policy.

C. Interpretation of the Policy: Other Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Prior Interpretations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following the initial adoption of former Rule 19c&hyph;4, the SROs issued a number of policy interpretations regarding
corporate actions that they believed were permitted under the rule. These interpretations will continue to apply
under the Policy with respect to the specific corporations for which the interpretations were issued. In addition,
they will be available as guidance to other corporations seeking authorization, from the SRO that issued the interpretation,
to engage in similar corporate activity. With respect to the specific company for which the interpretation was issued,
this provision is a reassurance that its action will not be re-evaluated under the Policy. With respect to other corporations
seeking to implement similar transactions, this provision grants the interpretation some precedential value to
be used when discussing the potential transaction with the SRO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Adoption of New Voting Rights Structures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In certain circumstances, the Policy also will provide greater flexibility than Rule 19c&hyph;4 for companies initially
adopting a new voting rights structure or altering their existing capital structure in such a fashion that might otherwise
be prohibited under the Policy. For example, if a company is in financial distress, the company might issue preferred
stock with heightened voting protection necessary to protect the interests of the preferred stock purchasers. The
SROs will evaluate the application of the Policy to such transactions on a case-by-case basis. In other situations,
issuances of preferred stock that have special voting rights attached would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to
determine if they are consistent with the Policy. In this regard, traditional varieties of preferred stock would
be permitted under the Policy. In contrast, blank-check preferred stock with unlimited voting rights generally
would be viewed as creating a new class of super voting rights and impermissible under the Policy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Issuers With Existing Dual Class Structures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of companies currently have multiple class structures. In addition, after the approval of the Policy, additional
companies may adopt multiple class structures consistent with the Policy. For example, a company could have a dual
class structure that it implemented prior to adoption of the Policy, or could have a permissible dual class structure
resulting from an initial public offering or the issuance of lower voting stock. Under former Rule 19c&hyph;4, such
a company generally was prohibited from issuing additional amounts of the higher voting stock unless such issuance
did not further disenfranchise existing shareholders. In effect, a company's existing dual class capital structure
was permitted only as to securities previously issued that were then outstanding in the market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Policy, there will be no restrictions on the ability of a dual class company to issue additional shares of
an existing class of higher voting stock in a capital-raising transaction, via a stock dividend, through the issuance
of stock options, or in a stock split. Such a company would not be permitted, however, to adopt a different capital structure
that reduces or restricts voting rights, such as a time-phased voting plan, or the issuance of a third class of stock
with greater voting rights than shares of any existing class.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Grandfather Provision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Policy, the SROs will ``grandfather'' all companies listed on the NYSE or Amex or included in the Nasdaq System
that have taken action inconsistent with the Policy prior to its approval by the Commission.
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 This will cover NYSE, Amex, or Nasdaq companies that either have (1) issued securities that would have violated the
new Policy, or (2) taken all corporate action necessary to authorize such an issuance. Such corporate action includes
the required shareholder approval as mandated by the state of incorporation, the corporation's by-laws or articles
of incorporation, or the home market. In addition, as noted above, contrary to former Rule 19c&hyph;4, which grandfathered
only existing securities, the Policy will in effect grandfather a company's dual class capital structure in its entirety.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, the NYSE proposal also specifically states that it will grandfather all NYSE companies that have taken action
inconsistent with former Rule 19c&hyph;4 since that rule was vacated.

Because Nasdaq NMS securities have been subject to a Rule 19c&hyph;4 standard which was adopted and has been enforced

Small Cap Nasdaq segment of the Nasdaq System.

D. Implementation of the Policy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Interaction With Other Markets
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
SRO interpretations under the Policy will be flexible, recognizing that both the capital markets and the circumstances
and needs of listed and Nasdaq issuers change over time. At the same time, the Policy will give the SROs broad discretion
in reviewing past voting rights actions by companies seeking to list on the Exchanges, or qualify for inclusion in
the Nasdaq System. Subject to the foregoing, the SROs will apply the following procedures in providing interpretations
under the Policy:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;An issuer seeking to list its securities on an Exchange, or qualify for inclusion in the Nasdaq System, may seek
advice from the respective SRO with respect to a proposed transaction. In such a case, the SRO would not provide advice
under the Policy if the issuer already had sought and received advice from its home market on the transaction. In that
instance, the SRO would honor the home market's interpretation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;If an SRO delists or deregisters an issuer's securities for violation of the Policy, the other SROs would not
subsequently list or include in Nasdaq the issuer's securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The SROs will publish their interpretations under the Policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These procedures essentially ensure that each SRO will have primary jurisdiction to provide advice to issuers in
its own market.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. SRO Review of Past Issuances
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SROs will have flexibility in reviewing the circumstances of the original issuance of any class of stock, including
non-voting stock, in determining whether to list such stock or permit its inclusion in the Nasdaq System. For example,
if a company issues stock shortly before seeking to list or qualify for inclusion, and such an issuance would have been
a violation of the Policy had the issuer been listed on the Exchange or included in the Nasdaq System, the Exchanges
generally would not list the stock and the NASD would not include the stock in the Nasdaq System. Similarly, if the issuer
voluntarily delisted from an Exchange or withdrew from the Nasdaq System in order to effect such an issuance, the SROs
also generally would not list the stock or include it in the Nasdaq System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are other situations, however, in which such a prior issuance would not necessarily be a bar to listing on the
Exchanges or inclusion in the Nasdaq System. For example, a company whose stock is traded over-the-counter but not
included in the Nasdaq System, such as on the NASD's Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, might effect such an issuance
well before the issuer contemplated listing on an Exchange or seeking to be qualified for inclusion in the Nasdaq System.
Under certain circumstances, it may be appropriate for the SRO to permit the listing or inclusion of such stock. To
maintain necessary flexibility, this area will be left open to the SROs for application to the particular facts and
circumstances of each case.

IV. Summary of Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission received two comment letters regarding the proposed uniform voting rights policy: one in favor of
the Policy
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 and one against the Policy because it was not sufficiently restrictive.
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 In addition to generally supporting the Policy and favoring the flexibility accorded to SROs in interpreting the
new Policy, the ABA letter urges regular, periodic, fully informed, and generally consistent interpretations by
the SROs. Further, it favors prompt publication of any meaningful distinctions in interpretation by the SROs. The
HFRRF letter principally opposes the ability under the Policy for corporations with dual class structures to an unlimited
right to issue additional shares of super voting stock. The HFRRF letter believes this aspect of the Policy will permit
further disenfranchisement of lower vote shareholders. It recommended that the SROs adopt certain structural safeguards
for those limited instances where multiple capitalization is permitted.

The recommendation includes: (1) Ensuring the voting disparity between the classes is not greater than 10&hyph;1;
(2) providing the low-vote class with the exclusive right to elect at least 25% of the board; and (3) at any time the high
vote class represents less than 12.5% of equity, providing the low vote class shares with the right to vote in the election
of the 75% of the board that they did not elect directly.

In addition, the NYSE previously solicited comments on an earlier version of the proposed rule change before it submitted
the proposal to its board of directors. The NYSE received 93 letters supporting, 39 opposing, and 14 taking a neutral
position towards the Policy.
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 According to the NYSE, the negative comment letters generally opposed the proposal for the following reasons: The
NYSE does not have jurisdiction in this area; the Policy is too restrictive and should permit any shareholder voting
policy that shareholders ratify; the Policy is too flexible and the NYSE should revert to a strict ``one-share, one-vote''
standard; and the Policy lacked specificity, thus not providing sufficient guidance as to what voting rights structures
the Policy would permit. The letters in favor of the Policy supported its adoption primarily for the following reasons:
the Policy protects the interests of shareholders; the Policy allows issuers responsible flexibility in the issuance
of lower voting stock; the Policy provides greater certainty in the U.S. capital markets; the Policy provides publicly
traded companies flexibility with respect to formulating their capital structures; and the Policy and its application
will result in uniformity among the markets, while providing the SROs needed flexibility in certain circumstances
to conduct a case-by-case analysis. The NYSE circulated a revised draft to various of its advisory committees to address
some of these concerns and received 12 written comments_eight in support, four offering various technical suggestions.

Finally, the Commission notes that several commenters to the NYSE draft proposal expressed concern that it could
conflict with the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Business Roundtable
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision, although no commenters raised this concern directly to the Commission. The Commission believes such concerns
are misplaced. Each of the three SROs is adopting the Policy into its own rules, whereas former Rule 19c&hyph;4 was
adopted by the Commission. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Business Roundtable
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 court merely rejected the basis offered by the Commission in adopting the Rule pursuant to Section 19(c) of the Act,
holding that the Commission's justification had exceeded its statutory authority thereunder. Although the substance
of former Rule 19c&hyph;4 is similar to the Policy, this has no bearing on the validity of SRO action taken pursuant
to Section 19(b) of the Act. In fact, the court in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Business Roundtable
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 decision specifically noted that exchanges and securities associations have the authority to propose rules, including
listing standards, pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act, even through in its opinion the Commission may not itself
impose similar rules under Section 19(c) of the Act.

V. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities association and national securities exchanges
and, in particular, the requirements of Sections 6 and 15A of the Act. Specifically, the Commission believes that,
consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act, the Policy does not unfairly discriminate among issuers
and will foster investor confidence in the markets thereby protecting investors and the public interest. In addition,
the Commission believes that the Policy and the procedures for its implementation further the maintenance of a fair
and orderly market. Finally, for the reasons set forth below, the Commission finds that, consistent with Sections
6(b)(8) and 15A(b)(9) of the Act, the proposal does not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the Act.

A. Shareholder Protection and the Public Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the issue of shareholder voting rights has far-reaching implications for shareholder
protection and the public interest, and that an SRO rule ensuring a minimum level of shareholder protection from disenfranchising
actions is appropriate and consistent with the Act. More specifically, it is reasonable for the SROs, in providing
a market to trade securities, to ensure that shareholders in that market are treated fairly. Widespread occurrences
of shareholder disenfranchisement could undermine investor confidence in the market and diminish investor participation.
As discussed below, the Policy, which was independently proposed by the NYSE, Amex, and NASD, and which will operate
through their respective listing standards, is drafted to provide public shareholders as much protection as possible
from disenfranchisement, while minimizing intrusion into traditional areas of state regulation and not unduly
interfering with the ability of public corporations to set their own capital structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the minimum standard for voting rights contained in the Policy will help prevent abusive
disenfranchisement of public shareholders and provide guidance to issuers that either currently have other than
a standard one-share, one-vote capital structure or that are contemplating a capital reorganization that may come
under the scrutiny of the Policy. The SROs have identified as narrowly as possible those corporate actions or issuances
that would disenfranchise shareholder voting rights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, as discussed above, the new Policy is similar, in part, to former Rule 19c&hyph;4, which was designed
to discourage issuers from engaging in activity involving corporate issuances or other corporate actions that nullified,
restricted, or disparately reduced the voting rights of existing shareholders of common stock and would continue
to permit transactions permitted under that standard. Based on the SROs' experience in applying former Rule 19c&hyph;4,
and in light of feedback they have received from various groups, the SROs have designed the Policy to be more flexible
than Rule 19c-4, especially in addressing certain business or economic situations which would warrant a corporation
to issue disparate voting rights stock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result, the Policy, in addition to permitting transactions that had been permitted under former Rule 19c&hyph;4,
generally will permit corporate actions or issuances that are consistent with the corporation's existing capital
structure in addition to allowing the SROs more flexibility in evaluating new issuances on a case-by-case basis.
The Commission believes that by assuring the continued permissibility of those corporate actions permitted under
former Rule 19c&hyph;4 release and under the interpretations issued pursuant to that rule, the SROs have provided
consistency for issuers.
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 On the other hand, the Commission believes that the Policy will provide the SROs useful flexibility in evaluating
transactions on a case-by-case basis and permitting issuers to adopt certain new voting rights structures consistent
with the Policy.

In this regard, the Commission has considered the suggestions presented in the HFRRF letter and does not believe that
the absence of additional ``structural safeguards'' is inconsistent with any requirements of the Act or the rules
and regulations thereunder. As stated earlier, the Policy recognizes that an investor in a dual class corporation
invests knowing and accepting the capital structure in place and the possibility of additional issuances of disparate
voting rights securities.

There may be valid business or economic reasons for corporations to issue disparate voting rights stock. The Policy
provides the SROs with a voting rights standard which will provide issuers with a certain degree of flexibility in
adopting corporate structures, so long as there is a reasonable business justification to so doing, and such transaction
is not taken or proposed primarily with the intent to disenfranchise.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Commission believes that the SROs' decision to ``grandfather'' the capital structure
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 of all listed (or qualified for inclusion in the Nasdaq System) companies that have taken action inconsistent with
the new Policy is reasonable and, for the reasons discussed herein, consistent with the purposes of the Act. First,
the Commission believes that it would be unduly burdensome upon issuers to require them to go back in time and unwind
transactions in order to come into compliance with the Policy. Second, the Commission believes that the Policy is
a forward looking proposal to prevent disenfranchising transactions and that it would not be equitable to force issuers
to try to undo transactions previously effected. Finally, the Commission believes that the grandfather provision
of the Policy is necessary to avoid unfair discrimination between issuers, in that issuers will not be required to
change their capital structures in order to come into compliance with rules to which they were not subject when creating
such a capital structure.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Policy's grandfather provision, issuers can continue to issue additional amounts of any security which
is a part of the capital structure being grandfathered. This would include super voting stock, time phased voting
plans, and capped voting plans so long as the characteristics of such stock remains unchanged. For instance, if pursuant
to an existing time-phased voting plan, the trigger date is four years, the issuer could not issue a new class of stock
with a different trigger date or change the trigger date of the existing class.

B. Statutory Requirements Applicable to Securities Exchanges and Associations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the Commission has reviewed the proposed rule changes to ensure that they ``are not designed to permit
unfair discrimination between *&blank;*&blank;* issuers'' pursuant to Sections 6(b)(5) and 15(A)(6) of the Act
and ``do not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of [the Act]''
pursuant to Sections 6(b)(8) and 15A(b)(9).
<FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are appropriate in the public interest, and necessary
for the protection of investors. For several reasons, the Commission believes that the Policy fulfills these requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, the Policy is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among issuers. As noted above, the Policy will be
applicable to all Section 12 registered securities listed or quoted on the respective markets. On Nasdaq this includes
both Nasdaq NMS and Nasdq Small Cap companies and on Amex this includes EM listed companies. In addition, although
an issuer participating in a violative transaction may no longer be listed on any of the three markets, this is not the
result of unfair discrimination. The nature of a listing or eligibility requirements is to set standards with which
all issuers must comply in order to have ready access to the market. Indeed, the Act recognizes that U.S. securities
markets will develop their own eligibility standards for securities traded on their markets and duelist those companies
which do not comply. Thus, the Commission believes that the adoption of the Policy as a listing or eligibility standard
for the respective Eros does not unfairly discriminate among issuers and thus is consistent with the provisions of
Sections 6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Commission believes that the Policy will enhance the ability of the Exchanges and the NASA to fulfill their
responsibilities under Sections 6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act. In particular, the Commission believes that the
Policy is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practice, and to promote just and equitable principles
of trade. Moreover, the Policy is designed to protect investors and the public interest.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 As discussed above, the Policy protects investors from disparate voting rights plans that result in disenfranchisement,
which eliminates a shareholder's right to have any effect on future corporate decisions through transactions that
are not fully subject to market discipline. At the same time, however, the Policy is crafted to permit disparate voting
rights plans that do not disenfranchise existing shareholders and assure that the creation of shares with lesser
voting rights are subject to market discipline. This avoids unduly rights are subject to market discipline. This
avoids unduly burdening issuers and allows for flexibility in devising a corporation's capital structure.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Third, the Commission also believes the Policy will not pose an inappropriate burden on competition among markets
because the Policy only sets a minimum threshold standard common to all three SROs. Each SRO is free to adopt a stricter
standard in competing for listings, if it chooses to do so. Further, the Policy still permits the SROs to compete for
listings based upon a variety of other factors such as the quality of their markets, services offered, and fees charged.
Finally, in regard to competition among issuers, the Policy only restricts issuers to the extent that they act to disenfranchise
shareholders but allows them to adopt a panopoly of non-disenfranchising structures.

C. Implementation Provisions and Commission Oversight
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As discussed above, the SROs intend to adopt consistent procedures on providing advice under the Policy to prevent
inconsistent interpretations that might invite abuse. In this regard, the SROs intend to publish their respective
interpretations and honor each other's interpretations, with the home market having primary jurisdiction over
transactions proposed by its issuers. Generally, if the NYSE or AMEX delist or the NASD deregisters an issuer's securities
for violation of the Policy, the issuer will not be accepted subsequently for listing on the NYSE or Amex or qualify
for inclusion in the Nasdaq System. In addition, during a new listing application process, each SRO will review past
corporate action regarding voting rights, including action undertaken shortly prior to applying for listing or
inclusion, in an attempt to flag such activity entered into solely in order to circumvent the Policy.
<FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
34
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the Policy will not be applied retroactively. Nevertheless, the SROs intend to scrutinize closely
any disenfranchising actions taken shortly before a listing request.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that these consistent interpretative procedures are necessary to prevent degradation
of the Policy and provide consistency and predictability for issuers.
<FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>
 The SROs would not be able to proffer issuers an open, flexible voting rights standard and at the same time retain a meaningful
voting rights Policy if they were open to unlimited issuer pressure to eviscerate the Policy. The SROs recognize that,
with the implementation provisions, there is less likelihood that issuer pressure could create a ``loophole'' that
will defeat the purpose of the Policy of each SRO. The Commission agrees that the SROs' action is necessary here to prevent
abuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In this regard, the Commission agrees with the ABA letter in that consistency and reliability of interpretations
is fundamental to the success of the Policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, without the implementation procedures, the erosion of the minimum standard, with the consequent occurrences
of shareholder disenfranchisement, could reduce investor confidence and participation in these markets. On the
other hand, consistent interpretation of the Policy will increase investor confidence in the quality and reliability
of the securities traded in these markets. Thus, the provisions of the Policy regarding implementation and interaction
with other markets, including the proposed procedures to honor interpretations under the Policy, are an integral
and necessary means of assuring meaningful implementation of the Policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Commission's extensive oversight over the enforcement of all SRO rules, including listing standards,
will help to ensure that the Policy is not implemented in an anticompetitive or discriminatory manner. For example,
the Commission inspects SROs for, among other things, compliance with SRO rules, and is authorized to bring enforcement
action against an SRO for failure to comply with its own rules (including listing standards).
<FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, any action by an SRO to apply and enforce the Policy unfairly or in an anticompetitive manner could subject
the SRO to an enforcement action by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<FOOTNOTE>
<FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
36
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 19(h) of the Act, the Commission is authorized to bring an enforcement action against any SRO that fails
to comply with its own rules. Therefore, failure by an SRO to apply its listing standards, or action by an SRO to enforce
them in a manner inconsistent with its rules, would subject the SRO to discipline by the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Finally, the Commission's authority in approving delistings and in reviewing appeals by issuers whose securities
are delisted from an Exchange or terminated from inclusion in the Nasdaq System should further ensure fair application
of the Policy. For example, before a security can be delisted by an Exchange under Section 12 of the Act, the Commission
must enter an order granting the application to delist,
<FOOTCITE>37</FOOTCITE>
 and may order a hearing to determine whether such application has been made in accordance with the rules of the Exchange.
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 Moreover, under Section 19(d)(2) of the Act, the Commission is authorized to review any SRO action that prohibits
or limits any person in respect to access to services offered by the SRO.
<FOOTCITE>39</FOOTCITE>
 In summary, the Commission's pervasive oversight over the implementation of SRO listing standards, in addition
to the right of any issuer delisted, terminated from quotation, or denied listing as a result of an interpretation
under the Policy to have the action reviewed by the Commission, will help to ensure that the Policy will not be implemented
in an anti-competitive or discriminatory manner.

Section 19(f) of the Act sets forth the applicable standard of review of any such action taken by an SRO, which would
require the Commission to (1) ascertain if the action was taken in accordance with the rules of the SRO and (2) ensure
that such rules are, and were applied in a manner consistent with the purposes of the Act.

The Commission believes that the NYSE's, Amex's, and NASD's proposals to adopt the Policy as set forth above is an important
step toward increasing shareholder protection, thereby enhancing investor confidence in the U.S. securities markets.
The Commission continues to encourage the adoption of such standards by the remaining SROs, and remains confident
that such a voting rights listing standard is a beneficial step toward strengthing the U.S. securities markets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with Sections 6(b)(8) and 15A(b)(9)
<FOOTCITE>40</FOOTCITE>
 of the Act, which provide that an SRO's rules must not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate
in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Commission recognizes that, under the Policy, issuers with capital
structures that do not conform to the requirements of the Policy will not be permitted to list or include their securities
on three major U.S. markets. Nevertheless, the Commission is persuaded by the SROs' stated objectives_to enhance
investor protections
<FOOTCITE>41</FOOTCITE>
; and to provide investors with the protections the Policy affords and the benefit of knowing that issuers cannot avoid
the effects of a market's voting rights policy by seeking an interpretation in another market
<FOOTCITE>42</FOOTCITE>
_that the Policy and procedures for interpretations under the Policy do not place an undue burden on competition and
that any burden on competition that may result from the Policy is appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the
Act.

Similarly, as discussed in this order, the Commission believes the proposed rule changes do not violate Sections
6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>
 which provide, among other things, that the rules of an SRO may not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between

For the reasons stated above, as well as the analysis contained in this order, the Commission believes that the protections
afforded shareholders by the adoption of SRO proposals that will prohibit certain disparate voting rights plans
that disenfranchise existing shareholders is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder pertaining to a national securities association and to national securities exchanges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>
 that the proposed rule changes (SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;20, SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;29, and SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;95)

In 1984, the Commission approved the first phase of a southbound linkage between the BSE and the ME for the routing of
orders for the purchase and sale of securities listed on the BSE.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The initial phase of the linkage permitted ME members to direct to the BSE marketable limit orders in approximately
forty U.S.-listed Canadian national stocks available for trading on the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'').
In 1985, phase two of the linkage was approved permitting the BSE to expand the list of securities eligible to be traded
on the linkage to include most ITS securities traded on the BSE.

The proposed rule change establishes a trading linkage for the transmission of orders in certain Canadian securities
from the BSE to the ME (``northbound linkage''). The linkage will be administered pursuant to the Linkage Plan agreement
between the BSE and ME. The Linkage Plan contains provisions relating to management of the linkage, resolution of
trade disputes, comparison and settlement of trades, and surveillance of transactions.

As a result of the northbound linkage, BSE members will be able to route orders for dually traded Canadian securities
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 directly to the ME for execution. The broker-dealers may enter orders for Canadian securities into their in-house
electronic systems, which are linked to the BSE's BEACON system. BEACON receives and records the details of each order
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 before routing them directly to the ME's automated order-routing and execution system.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 The ME system then logs each order and directs it to the ME specialist's electronic book.

Upon the execution of a U.S. customer's order on the ME, a customer report is sent from the ME specialist's book through
the ME system to the BEACON system, with both systems logging in the details of the report. BEACON then sends the report
to the U.S. broker-dealer's in-house system. The trades are cleared in Canada pursuant to the BSE member's agreement
with a Canadian correspondent to clear and settle trades at the Canadian Depository for Securities (``CDS'') on its
behalf.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements
of Section 6(b).
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5), which requires that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.

The Commission generally views agreements between the United States and foreign securities exchanges as positive
developments that reflect and contribute to the increasing internationalization of the world's securities markets.
<FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>
 Linkages, in particular, facilitate the flow of capital and financial services across borders. Currently, when
a BSE member has customer orders for Canadian securities to be traded on the ME, it must make arrangements with a Canadian
broker-dealer (ME member) to place the orders on the ME for execution. The linkage proposed by the BSE will establish
an order routing mechanism for the transmission of orders from BSE members to the ME involving Canadian securities
traded on the ME and also registered under Section 12(b) of the Act. As a result, the linkage should improve the efficient
handling of such orders routed by BSE members on behalf of their customers to the ME.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21441 (October 31, 1984), 49 FR 44575 (November 7, 1984), and a linkage between
the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Midwest Stock Exchange (now the Chicago Stock Exchange),

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

The Commission notes that the northbound linkage is not intended to create a single market or to ``link'' the BSE and
ME marketmaking functions for dually listed securities.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Although the northbound trading linkage uses the BSE's BEACON system to communicate orders to the ME, trading between
the ME and BSE specialists will not be coordinated, nor will a BSE specialist be allowed to interact with U.S. customer
orders entered by broker-dealers into the northbound linkage for routing to the ME. Nevertheless, agency duties
will require BSE members to route orders to the market that will provide the best execution.
<FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, customers should not be disadvantaged by a BSE member's decision to route their orders to a particular
market.

For example, as with trading in any security dually listed on a U.S. exchange and a foreign exchange, the BSE and ME specialists'

A broker-dealer must seek to obtain the best execution for customer orders. Best execution generally means that a
broker-dealer must obtain the most favorable terms available under the circumstances for a customer's transaction.
A broker-dealer's duty to seek to obtain the best execution of customer orders derives from the common law agency duty
of loyalty, which obligates an agent to act exclusively in the principal's best interest. This common law agency principle
has been incorporated into case law and Commission decisions under the federal securities laws.

The Commission has reviewed the Linkage Plan for the northbound linkage between the BSE and ME to ensure that it will
provide U.S. investors with protection against fraudulent and manipulative acts. The Commission believes that
a surveillance sharing agreement between markets proposing to develop linkages for order routing purposes is an
essential element to any Linkage Plan. Such agreements ensure the quality of information necessary to detect or deter
potential manipulation and other trading abuses. In this regard, the BSE is a member and the ME is an affiliate members
of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG''), which provides for the exchange of necessary surveillance information.
ISG coordinates surveillance and investigative information sharing arrangements in the stock and options markets.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that this structure should enhance the level of cooperation between the BSE and ME surveillance
departments with regard to transactions executed through the northbound linkage.

In addition, the Commission notes that each northbound trade will be entered into the ME's electronic book, and will
therefore be subject to the ME's on-line stock trading monitoring system (``SECMA'').
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, the BSE and ME have developed a trade execution monitoring program for the surveillance of orders directed
to the ME from the BSE's BEACON system. These surveillance procedures should also help to detect as well as deter any
potential manipulation.

The ME currently focuses its trading reviews on insider trading, trading on non-public market information (``front
running''), price manipulation (market fraud of various types, short squeeze, short sales down ticking, normal
course issue of bid up ticking, and restrictions on trading by members involved in a distribution. In conducting these
types of trading reviews, the ME utilizes price alerts, volume alerts, exception reports based on high-lows and closing
prices, as well as other technical information analysis and graphics that are available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In summary, the Commission believes that the BSE has set forth a reasonable proposal. In particular, by limiting the
northbound linkage to securities that are traded on the BSE and registered under Section 12(b) of the Act, the linkage
will provide customers with access to executions on the ME, while ensuring that such customers continue to receive
the protection of the federal securities laws and the rules thereunder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the rule change prior to the thirtieth day after publication
of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 1 restricts the securities that may be traded through the northbound linkage
to securities that are registered under Section 12(b) of the Act
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 and therefore limits the scope of the rule change as originally proposed. The broader proposed rule change was published

described in Items I and II below, which items have been prepared primarily by MSTC. The Commission is publishing this

In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission recently approved certain changes to MSTC's Rules and By-laws relating to the election of MSTC's Board
of Directors.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 MSTC's 1994 annual meeting was originally postponed because of the pending rule filing. Pursuant to the Commission's
order approving the filing, the size of the MSTC Board was expanded to thirty-one, the same size as the Board of its parent,
the Chicago Stock Exchange (``CHX''). The filing also amended MSTC's By-laws to make the members of the MSTC Board
and nominating committee the same as those of the CHX.

Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34608 (October 13, 1994), 59 FR 46074 [File No. SR&hyph;MSTC&hyph;94&hyph;09].
The Commission concluded at that time that the new rules were consistent with the fair representation requirements
under the Act.

The CHX/MSTC nominating committee imminently will be commencing deliberations for its slate of candidate for the
1995 annual meetings, of CHX, MCC, and MSTC to be held in April 1995. Because of this, MSTC and its shareholder CHX do
not believe that it is in the best interests of MSTC to have a 1994 annual meeting in such close proximity to the 1995 annual
meeting. To do so will not only make the nominating committee's work extremely difficult (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 preparing for two meetings at once) but also could confuse participants of MSTC. Thus the purpose of the proposal is
to avoid the confusion and burden of holding a 1994 annual meeting within a few months of the scheduled date of the 1995
annual meeting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17(A)(b)(3)(F) of the Act in that it fosters cooperation and coordination
with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that the rules of the clearing agency foster cooperation and coordination
with persons engaged in the clearance and settlement of securities transactions.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The proposal to not hold the 1994 annual meeting so close to the regularly scheduled 1995 annual meeting should avoid
confusion among the participants arising from having to consider two director elections within a few months. (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
I.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
directors elected in 1994 would only serve for the few months prior to the 1995 election held during the 1995 Board meeting.)
In addition, the limited term of a few months for a Board elected at this time could create confusion for participants.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal to not hold the 1994 annual meeting also should avoid the financial burden of holding two annual meetings
within such a short period of time. The Commission agrees with MSTC that the burden and costs of holding a 1994 annual
meeting at this time would be greatly in excess of its usefulness.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 17A(b)(3)(C) of the Act requires that the rules of the clearing agency assure fair representation of its shareholders
and participant in the selection of its directors.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Because the current Board was elected pursuant to MSTC rules designed to assure such fair representation, the Commission
believes that retaining the current Board for a few additional months until the successor Board can be elected in an
orderly fashion is consistent with the fair representation requirements under the Act.

MSTC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule changes prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed
rule because in order to hold their 1995 annual meeting in April, MSTC must begin preparations now.

The Commission recently approved NSCC's proposed rule change which facilitates NSCC's daily distribution of a Consolidated
Trade Summary that reports both Continuous Net Settlement (``CNS'') and Non-CNS trades due for settlement the next
day. NSCC continues to distribute each day its current CNS and non-CNS Compared Trade Summaries which also report
in greater detail the trades due to settle the next day. On December 31, 1994, NSCC intends to eliminate the CNS and non-CNS
Compared Trade Summaries and distribute only the Consolidated Trade Summary. Securities Exchange Act Release No.

In its filing with the Commission, NSCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary purpose of the proposed rule change is to change all references to the Continuous Net Settlement (``CNS'')
and Non-CNS Compared Trade Summaries contained in NSCC's Procedures Section II(D), governing the Trade Comparison
Service for debt securities, Section II(E), governing the Trade Comparison Service for when-issued securities,
and Section V(C), governing net balance orders, to references to the Consolidated Trade Summary. The proposed rule
is necessary because such changes were inadvertently omitted from NSCC's recently approved rule change regarding
the Consolidated Trade Summary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule corrects and conforms NSCC's procedures regarding the Consolidated Trade Summary. The proposed
rule change, therefore, is consistent with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 and the rules and regulations thereunder because it will facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement
of securities transactions.

the rights of persons using the services of NSCC. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such rule change, the
Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes
of the Act.

The proposed rule change, as amended, was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34849 (October
18, 1994), 59 FR 53695 (October 25, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule change adopts Commentary .05 to PSE Rule 5.14(b), which governs the execution of stock cross transactions,
to facilitate the execution of large agency crosses. The proposed Commentary is designed to permit the execution
of ``clean'' agency crosses of 25,000 shares or more at or within the prevailing quotation without regard to the priority
of existing bids or offers where both the buy and sell orders are for accounts other than that of a member or member organization
or non-member broker dealer. The proposal, however, would allow the cross to be broken up at a price that is better than
the proposed cross price for one side or the other, but in doing so the member must satisfy all other existing bids and
offers at that price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission notes that similar rules are in place at the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'')
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and at the American Stock Exchange (``Amex'')
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The NYSE and Amex rules, like the PSE proposal, restrict clean crosses to agency orders, of 25,000 shares or more,
and permit such crosses to be broken up only if price improvement will result therefrom and all other bids and offers
at that price are satisfied.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The clean cross proposal should facilitate the ability of PSE members to execute block agency cross transactions
on the PSE by giving such orders priority over orders at or within the prevailing quotation. At the same time, the proposal
preserves the auction market principle of price improvement by permitting the cross transaction to be broken up at
a better price. The proposal also preserves the principle of priority by requiring that a member who breaks up a cross
by providing a better price must first satisfy all existing market interest having priority at that better price before
trading with any part of the cross.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission recognizes that approval of the clean cross proposal could disadvantage orders on the book, or in the
trading crowd, at the same price as the cross transaction. This is the only aspect of the proposal that really represents
a departure from existing auction market principles. Thus, under the proposal, a clean cross could be executed while
a public investor's limit order on the book remains unexecuted. For example, if a public customer left a limit order
on the specialist's book at 10 a.m., bidding for 500 shares of XYZ at 40, a so-called clean cross could be executed at
10:10 at a price of 40 without satisfying the public customer order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously noted in the approval of the NYSE and Amex proposal, the Commission still believes that a preferable
approach would be to establish a means of intermarket price protection for all limit orders in all market centers.
However, with no means of intermarket price protection for public limit order, and given Commission approval of the
NYSE's and Amex's identical clean cross proposals, as well as other regional exchange proposals designed to minimize
interference with cross transactions, it could be unfair to preclude the PSE from adapting to the present competitive
environment by facilitating the execution of agency block cross transactions on the Exchange. Thus, the Commission
believes that it is not unreasonable or inconsistent with the Act for the PSE to react to competitive pressures for
block business by permitting large agency crosses to occur at or within the bid or offer price. In this regard, the proposed
rule change should further competition among exchanges and other competing market centers and increase opportunities
for the more efficient execution of block-sized agency cross transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the proposal restricts sufficiently the circumstances in which members may execute
clean cross transactions on the Exchange. In particular, the Commission believes that the share size threshold of
25,000 shares or more should help to ensure that the clean cross proposal will apply primarily to large block-sized
orders where the depth of the prevailing bid or offer may be less likely to satisfy either side of the clean cross. In
addition, because the proposal is limited to agency orders only, the proposal should assist public customers in effecting
cross transactions on the Exchange and should not give any special advantage to members, member organizations, and
non-member broker dealers in their proprietary trading.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the Commission believes that the clean cross proposal should allow the Exchange to compete with other
exchanges for block-sized orders more fairly while upholding the auction market principle of price improvement.
In this context, while the proposed Commentary allows market interest of any size to break up a cross transaction,
the Commentary also requires that a member breaking up a cross must provide a better price than the cross price to one
side of the cross and he or she must satisfy in their entirety any bids or offers that have priority at that better price
before taking any part of the cross.

For the above reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with
the requirements of Sections 6(b) and 11A.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the
rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public; the Section 6(b)(8) requirement that the rules of an exchange
do not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the Act; and the Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(ii)
mandate for fair competition among exchange markets.

I. Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PHILADEP and SCCP are amending Article IV, Section 2 of their respective By-Laws to remove the requirement that the
two vice chairmen of the board of governors of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'') serve as ex-officio
members of their boards of directors. The amendments install the chief operating officer of the PHLX both as an ex-officio
member of both of the boards of directors and also as the vice chairman of the boards. The amendments reduce the requisite
number of PHLX governors who must serve on the PHILADEP and SCCP boards of directors from a majority of the fifteen to
seventeen directors to six of the directors. The amendments also change the term of office for the boards of directors
to synchronize the term of office for the chairman of the PHLX's board of governors with his terms of office on the PHILADEP
and SCCP boards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PHILADEP and SCCP also are amending Article III, Section 4(a) of their By-Laws which currently require that each nominating
committee consist of five ex-officio members of the board of directors and two other persons appointed by the chairman
of the board. Under the amended rules, each nominating committee will consist of four ex-officio members of the board
of directors and three other persons appointed by the chairman of the boards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PHILADEP and SCCP Boards of Directors will continue to provide the PHLX, as the sole shareholder of both PHILADEP
and SCCP, with adequate representation. The PHLX will be represented by both senior exchange staff personnel and
by members of the PHLX board of governors, who typically also represent PHILADEP and SCCP participant firms. In accordance
with PHILADEP's and SCCP's amendment processes delineated in By-Law Article XI, the Chairman of the PHLX board of
governors, as agent for the sole shareholder and parent corporation, has signed a unanimous consent in lieu of a special
meeting to effectuate the foregoing changes.

II. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the proposed rule changes are consistent with Section 17A of the Act and specifically
with Section 17A(b)(3)(C).
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Section 17A(b)(3)(C) requires that a clearing agency assure fair representation of its shareholders or members
and participants in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. As stated above, the proposed
rule changes provide the PHLX with continued fair and adequate representation in its capacity as the sole shareholder
of both PHILADEP and SCCP. The proposed rule changes also afford fair representation to the participants by continuing
to require their representation on the boards of directors and nominating committees of both PHILADEP and SCCP.

III. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements
of the Act, and in particular with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
It is therefore ordered, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR&hyph;PHILADEP&hyph;94&hyph;01
and SCCP&hyph;94&hyph;03) be, and hereby are, approved.

Applicant's Representations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. PaineWebber, a Delaware corporation, is a registered broker-dealer and registered investment adviser. PaineWebber
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Paine Webber Group Inc. (``PWG''). PaineWebber serves as the investment adviser and
principal underwriter of registered investment companies and proposes to act as investment adviser and principal
underwriter to additional investment companies in the future. A wholly owned subsidiary of PaineWebber, Mitchell
Hutchins Asset Management Inc. (``Mitchell Hutchins'') serves as sub-advisor and sub-administrator to the registered
investment companies underwritten and advised by PaineWebber. In addition, Mitchell Hutchins is the investment
adviser and principal underwriter for a number of open-end and closed-end registered investment companies, and
anticipates serving in similar capacities with regard to additional registered investment companies in the future.
PaineWebber is also the sole depositor, or a co-depositor, and/or underwriter of numerous unit investment trusts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. General Electric Company (``GE''), the parent company of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. Incorporated (``Kidder''),
and Kidder have entered into an asset purchase agreement, dated October 17, 1994, with PWG. The asset purchase agreement
provides for the purchase by PWG and certain of its subsidiaries of certain assets of Kidder and its subsidiaries,
and contemplates the employment by PaineWebber of Kidder employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. PaineWebber currently is not disqualified from acting in any of the capacities specified in section 9(a) of the
Act.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Subject to receiving the requested exemption, however, PaineWebber proposes to employ Stanley S. Trotman, Jr. (``Mr.
Trotman'') in the health sciences group within its investment banking department. Mr. Trotman is subject to a securities
related injunction. Absent relief, Mr. Trotman's employment would cause PaineWebber to become disqualified under
section 9(a) of the Act from acting in any of the capacities specified in that section. Accordingly, PaineWebber seeks
the requested relief so that applicant, and any affiliated person of applicant, will not be disqualified from acting
in any of the capacities specified in section 9(a) by reason of employing Mr. Trotman.

4. Mr. Trotman currently co-heads the health care group within the investment banking department of Kidder. Prior
to holding this position, Mr. Trotman was a director of Charter Medical Corporation, T2 Medical, Inc., and Salick,
Healthcare, Inc. Until February 16, 1990, when Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, the parent of Drexel Burnham Lambert,
Incorporated (``Drexel''), filed for bankruptcy protection, Mr. Trotman was a managing director of Drexel in charge
of the health care group in its corporate finance department.

5. On or about December 19, 1985, Drexel and Mr. Trotman consented to the entry of a final judgment and order of permanent
injunction (the ``Injunction'') in an action commenced by the SEC. Civil Action No. 85&hyph;9855 (United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York). The activities forming the basis for the Injunction took place
from approximately November 1981 to June 14, 1982, during which time Drexel acted as co-lead manager for two public
offerings of securities issued by Flight Transportation Corporation (``Flight''). The SEC's complaint alleged
that Drexel and Mr. Trotman violated sections 17(a) (2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with Drexel's
due diligence investigation for the underwriting of approximately $25.6 million of securities issued by Flight
in June 1982. The complaint alleged that the registration statement Flight filed with the SEC for these securities
contained materially false and misleading statements relating to the group charter business, including among other
things, the statement that Flight's $23 million group charter business comprised approximately one-third of Flight's
revenues, when, in fact, the group charter business did not and never had existed. The complaint alleged that Drexel
and Mr. Trotman placed undue reliance on the statements of Flight's management and failed to verify independently
the existence of Flight's group charger business by not contacting the customers or suppliers of the group charter
business. The terms of the Injunction required Mr. Trotman to submit his due diligence work for review by Drexel's
underwriting assistance committee for a period of four months and for Drexel to submit its written due diligence procedures
for review by outside counsel for an opinion as to the adequacy of the procedures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. On December 20, 1985, the SEC issued a temporary order under section 9(c) of the Act which exempted Drexel from section
9(a) with respect to the Injunction. On February 24, 1986, the SEC granted Drexel a permanent order under section 9(c)
of the Act.

order under section 9(c) granting Kidder relief from the prohibitions of section 9(a) resulting from the Injunction.
On June 20, 1990, the SEC granted Kidder a permanent order under section 9(c).

8. In the capacity of his employment with PaineWebber, Mr. Trotman would be expected to advise and assist PaineWebber's
corporate clients with their corporate financing, acquisition, and disposition needs. Together with a team of investment
banking specialists, Mr. Trotman would solicit investment banking clients, perform due diligence investments
of corporation in connection with proposed underwritings, acquisitions, or dispositions, work with counsel to
prepare underwriting documents, solicit prospective investors in connection with securities offerings, and structure,
price, and otherwise negotiate the terms of securities offerings.

90 days following the date of the order to relieve it from any ineligibility under section 9(a) by reason of the employment
by applicant of Mr. Trotman; and (b) a permanent order granting the request relief.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 9(a)(2) of the Act, in pertinent part, disqualifies any person from acting in the capacity of employee,
officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser, or depositor for any registered investment
company, or principal underwriter for any registered open-end company, registered unit investment trust, or registered
face-amount certificate company, if such person is, by reason of any misconduct, permanently or temporarily enjoined
from acting as an underwriter, broker, dealer, or investment adviser, or from engaging in or continuing any conduct
or practice in connection with any such activity or in connection with the purchase or sale of any security. A company
with an employee or other affiliated person ineligible to serve in any of these capacities under section 9(a)(2) is
similarly ineligible by reason of section 9(a)(3).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Section 9(c) of the Act provides that, upon application, the SEC shall grant an exemption from the disqualification
provisions of section 9(a), either unconditionally or on an appropriate temporary or other conditional basis, if
it is established that the prohibitions of section 9(a), as applied to the applicant, are unduly or disproportionately
severe or that the conduct of such person has been such as not to make it against the public interest or protection of
investors to grant such application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In support of its position that the SEC should grant the requested exemptions from the prohibitions of section 9(a),
PaineWebber asserts that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Neither PaineWebber nor any affiliated person of PaineWebber was the subject of the Injunction, and the facts
and circumstances to which the Injunction relate do not involve any activities of PaineWebber or its affiliates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) None of the PaineWebber investment companies were in any way involved in any of the circumstances referred to in
the Injunction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) As an employee in PaineWebber's investment banking department, Mr. Trotman will have no involvement with, or
responsibilities for, the PaineWebber investment companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) The allegations in the Commission's complaint against Mr. Trotman and the terms of the Injunction and the circumstances
to which they relate in no way involve any activities of an investment company. During Mr. Trotman's tenure with Kidder
and Drexel, he was not involved with the activities of any of Kidder's or Drexel's investment companies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Since the entry of the Injunction, Mr. Trotman has not been subject to any similar actions, or sanctioned in any
way by the SEC, any self-regulatory organization, or any state securities commission, nor are there any customer
complaints, lawsuits, or regulatory actions pending against Mr. Trotman.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The prohibitions of section 9(a) deprive Mr. Trotman of the opportunity to serve as an employee of any company,
such as PaineWebber, that serves as an investment adviser, principle underwriter, or depositor of investment companies,
in circumstances in which he would have no involvement in investment company operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) The prohibitions of section 9(a) would be unduly and disproportionately severe as applied to applicant because
they would deprive PaineWebber of Mr. Trotman's services in an area totally unrelated to the activities of an investment
company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Because the Commission has previously considered and granted, to both Drexel and Kidder, temporary and permanent
exemptions from the provisions of section 9(a) operative as a result of the Injunction, it is appropriate in the public
interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions
of the Act that the temporary exemption be granted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The temporary exemption is appropriate as it would: (i) permit Mr. Trotman to commence his employment with PaineWebber
and thus avoid loss of income which could occur if he were forced to forego this employment pending the final disposition
of the application; (ii) permit PaineWebber to provide investment banking services to former clients of Kidder that
wish to continue to utilize Mr. Trotman's services as an employee of PaineWebber; (iii) provide continuity of services
for such clients; and (iv) allow PaineWebber to provide continuity of service to its investment company clients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In making the application, PaineWebber acknowledges, understands, and agrees that the application and any exemption
issued by the SEC to applicant shall be without prejudice to, and shall not limit, the SEC's rights in any manner with
respect to any SEC investigation or enforcement action under the federal securities laws, or the consideration by
the SEC of any application for exemption from statutory requirements, including, without limitation, the consideration
of the instant application for a permanent exemption pursuant to section 9(c) from the provisions of section 9(a)
of the Act or the revocation or removal of any exemption granted in connection with the application.

Applicant's Condition

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a condition of the requested relief, neither PaineWebber, nor any affiliated person of PaineWebber relying upon
relief granted pursuant to the application, will employ Mr. Trotman in any capacity related directly to the provision
of investment advisory services to, or acting as a depositor for, any registered investment company or to acting as
a principal underwriter for any registered open-end investment company, unit investment trust or registered face
amount certificate company without first making further application to the SEC.

The Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority, has considered the matter and finds that,

It is ordered, under section 9(c) of the Act, that applicant is hereby temporarily exempted from the provisions of
section 9(a) of the Act, for a period to expire on the earlier of ninety days from the entry of the temporary order, the

1. Anchor National, a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of California, is an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of SunAmerica Inc., a financial services company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Anchor National established the Separate Account on June 25, 1981, to fund variable annuity contracts. The Separate
Account is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc. (``SEC''), the principal underwriter for certain of the existing Contracts,
is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. SCS also is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SunAmerica Inc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Contracts are or will be issued by Anchor National or other Affiliated Insurers and offered through the Separate
Account or any other separate account (as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the 1940 Act) of the issuing Affiliated Insurer
that is registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act (collectively, ``Eligible Account(s)''). The Contracts
will provide for accumulation of contract values and payment of benefits on a variable basis. Fixed accumulation
and/or payment options also may be available under the Contracts. (In the case of group Contracts, the term ``Contract,''
as used herein, will include a certificate issued to a participant in the group; the term ``Contract owner'' will include
such a participant.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Various fees and charges may be deducted from contract values or the assets of an Eligible Account to pay for expenses
incurred in connection with administering and selling the Contract and for assuming certain risks thereunder. All
such charges will be permitted either pursuant to rules adopted under the 1940 Act or by order of the Commission, and
will be fully disclosed in the prospectuses for the Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') may be imposed upon certain withdrawals from the Contracts. The
CDSC may vary in amount, according to a schedule contained in the applicable Contract and described in its prospectus,
depending upon the contribution year of the purchase payment being withdrawn. Purchase payments withdrawn after
a specified period of time will not be subject to the CDSC and may be withdrawn free of such charge. The applicable Contracts
prescribe the circumstances in which the CDSC may be reduced or waived, including in connection with the ``Confinement
Waiver benefit'' described below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Under a Contract to which the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' applies, the CDSC will be waived upon the Contract
owner's request for full or partial surrender of the Contract value prior to the annuity date. This ``Confinement
Waiver benefit'' will be available if:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The Contract owner is confined to an eligible nursing home and/or hospital for at least 60 consecutive days
while the Contract is in force;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A surrender or partial withdrawal request and adequate proof of confinement are received by the Affiliated
Insurer either while the Contract owner is confined or within 90 days of the Contract owner's discharge from the nursing
home or hospital; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Confinement in the nursing home and/or hospital is prescribed by a physician and is medically necessary.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
8. The ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' may not be exercised before the expiration of 90 days from the date the Contract
is issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. A new 60 day confinement period must be satisfied each time the Contract owner becomes newly confined (whether for
the same unrelated causes), if services by an eligible nursing home and/or hospital have not been provided for a period
of at least six months. A new 60 day confinement need not be satisfied, however, if services for related causes were
provided within six months of current receipt of services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Anchor National and SunAmerica Inc. have determined that the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' is a desirable feature,
and beneficial to variable annuity contract owners. Accordingly, they wish to have the flexibility to incorporate
such a feature in both existing and new Contracts, in jurisdictions where permitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. In jurisdictions where permitted, Affiliated Insurers will make the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' available
to all new owners of affected Contracts. The Affiliated Insurers reserve the right not to make the ``Confinement Waiver
benefit'' available to certain of their existing Contracts. Alternatively, an Affiliated Insurer may make the ``Confinement
Waiver benefit'' available to existing Contracts subject to the satisfaction of eligibility requirements uniformly
applied to owners of such Contracts_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the making of an additional purchase payment under the Contract within a specified period of time, and in a prescribed
amount (which may vary depending on whether the Contract is held in connection with a tax-qualified plan).

Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, the Commission may, by order upon application, conditionally or unconditionally
exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions, from
any provision or provisions of the 1940 Act or from any rule or regulation thereunder, if and to the extent that such
exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and
the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. Pursuant to Section 6(c), the Applicants
request that the Commission issue an order to provide the exemptive relief set forth below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants submit that granting the requested relief not only to variable annuity contracts issued by Anchor National
and funded in the Separate Account, but also to variable annuity contracts funded in other separate accounts that
Anchor National has or may establish, will eliminate the necessity for filing multiple applications for relief under
circumstances where no new issues would be presented by the subsequent applications. Similar reasoning applies
to extending the relief to apply to Contracts issued by other Affiliated Insurers as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 22(d) of the 1940 Act provides that no registered investment company shall sell any redeemable security
issued by it to any person except either to or through a principal underwriter for distribution, or at a current public
offering price described in the prospectus. Applicants recognize that the proposed waiver of the withdrawal charge
in connection with the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' described above could be viewed as causing the Contracts to
be sold at other than a uniform offering price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Under certain prescribed conditions, Rule 22d&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act provides an exemption from Section 22(d)
to the extent necessary to permit the sale of redeemable securities issued by a registered investment company at prices
that reflect scheduled variations in, or elimination of, the sales load to particular classes of investors or transactions.
However, to the extent that it has been interpreted by the Commission as granting relief only for scheduled variations
in front-end sales loads_not deferred sales loads such as the CDSC_Rule 22d&hyph;1 is not directly applicable to
Applicants' proposed waiver of the withdrawal charge in connection with the ``Confinement Waiver benefit.'' Applicants
nevertheless submit that by adopting Rule 22d&hyph;1, the Commission has decided that variations in front-end sales
loads should be permitted universally, subject to the standards embodied in that Rule, and that similar considerations
should apply with at least the same force for the requested variation in deferred sales charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Rule 22d&hyph;2 under the 1940 Act exempts registered variable annuity accounts, their principal underwriters,
dealers and sponsoring insurance companies from Section 22(d) to the extent necessary to permit variations in the
sales load or in any administrative charge or other deductions from the purchase payments, provided that any such
variations reflect differences in costs or services, are not unfairly discriminatory, and are adequately described
in the prospectus. Applicants do not represent that the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' reflects differences in
sales costs or services, however, and for that reason do not rely on Rule 22d&hyph;2 for the requested relief, even
assuming that Rule 22d&hyph;2 does apply to deferred sales loads.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants note that while Rule 6c&hyph;8 under the 1940 Act permits variable annuity separate accounts to impose
a deferred sales charge, it neither imposes any conditions on the ability of an investment company to provide for variations
in the deferred sales charges nor provides an exemption from Section 22(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicants submit that the proposed waiver is consistent with the policies of Section 22(d) and the rules promulgated
thereunder. One of the purposes of Section 22(d) is to prevent an investment company from discriminating among investors
by charging different prices to different investors. Applicants represent that because the ``Confinement Waiver
benefit'' will be available prospectively to any new Contract owner who becomes confined to a hospital or nursing
home for 60 days or more (as is described more fully above), the benefit will not unfairly discriminate among Contract
owners in jurisdictions where it is permitted by state law. Applicants further represent that the benefit advantages
Contract owners by permitting them to surrender their Contracts without imposition of the withdrawal charge, upon
the occurrence of the contingency described above, and that the benefit will not result in dilution of the interests
of any other Contract owner. Applicants also represent that waiving the withdrawal charge under such circumstances
will not result in the occurrence of any of the abuses that Section 22(d) of the Act is designed to prevent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicants represent that the ``Confinement Waiver benefit,'' if offered in connection with a particular Contract,
would comply with the substantive provisions set forth in Rule 22d&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act. More specifically represent
that the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' will be: uniformly available to all Contract owners who are eligible therefor;
and adequately described in the applicable prospectus for the Contracts (or supplements thereto) before being made
available to Contract owners. If the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' is made available to existing Contracts, the
Affiliated Insurers will inform owners of the relevant Contracts of the availability of the benefit by transmitting
a copy of the endorsement or rider for attachment to their Contracts (as well as by supplementing the prospectus for
such Contracts), as soon as is reasonably practicable. If the ``Confinement Waiver benefit'' is made available to
existing Contracts subject to the satisfaction of eligibility requirements, the Affiliated Insurers will inform
the owners of the relevant Contracts of the availability of the benefit and the relevant requirements by transmitting
a current prospectus or supplement thereto that adequately describes the benefit and the requirements.

13 CFR 107.302 limits maximum annual Cost of Money (as defined in 13 CFR 107.3) that may be imposed upon a Small Concern
in connection with Financing by means of Loans or through the purchase of Debt Securities. The cited regulation incorporates
the term ``Debenture Rate'', which is defined elsewhere in 13 CFR 107.3 in terms that require SBA to publish, from time
to time, the rate charged on ten-year debentures sold by Licensees to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, Licensees are hereby notified that effective the date of publication of this Notice, and until further
notice, the Debenture Rate for computation of maximum cost of money pursuant to 13 CFR 107.302 is 8.50 percent per annum.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13 CFR 107.302 does not supersede or preempt any applicable law imposing an interest ceiling lower than the ceiling
imposed by its own terms. Attention is directed to Section 308(i) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended,
to that law's Federal override of State usury ceilings, and to its forfeiture and penalty provisions.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FFA) announces its findings on the noise compatibility program submitted
by the City South Lake Tahoe, California, under the provisions of Title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement
Act of 1979 (Public Law 96&hyph;193) and 14 CFR Part 150. These findings are made in recognition of the description
of federal and nonfederal responsibilities in Senate Report No. 96&hyph;52 (1989). On November 14, 1994 the FAA determined
that the noise exposure maps submitted by the City under Part 150 were in compliance with applicable requirements.
On November 14, 1994, the Assistant Administrator for Airports approved the Lake Tahoe Airport noise compatibility
program. Thirteen (13) of the proposed action elements were approved and four (4) elements were disapproved for purposes
of Part 150.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces that the FAA has given its overall approval to the noise compatibility program for the Lake Tahoe
Airport, effective November 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 104(a) of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''),
an airport operator who has previously submitted a noise exposure map, may submit to the FAA, a noise compatibility
program which sets for the measures taken or proposed by the airport operator for the reduction of existing noncompatible
land uses and prevention of additional noncompatible land uses within the area covered by the noise exposure maps.
The Act requires such programs to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties including local
communities, government agencies, airport users and FAA personnel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each airport noise compatibility program developed in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part
150 is a local program not a federal program. The FAA does not substitute its judgment for that of the airport proprietor
with respect to which measures should be recommended for action. The FAA's approval or disapproval of FAR Part 150
program recommendations is measured according to the standards expressed in Part 150 and the Act and is limited to
the following determinations:

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The noise compatibility program was developed in accordance with the provisions and procedures of FAR Part 150;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Program measures are reasonably consistent with achieving the goals of reducing existing noncompatible land
uses around the airport and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Program measures would not create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, unjustly discriminate against
type or classes of aeronautical uses, violate the terms of airport grant agreements, or intrude into areas preempted
by the federal government; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Program measures relating to the use of light procedures can be implemented within the period covered by the program
without derogating safety, adversely affecting the efficient use and management of the navigable airspace and air
traffic control systems, or adversely affecting other powers and responsibilities of the Administrator prescribed
by law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific limitations with respect to FAA's approval of an airport noise compatibility program are delineated in
FAR Part 150, Section 150.5. Approval is not a determination concerning the acceptability of land uses under federal,
state, or local law. Approval does not by itself constitute an FAA implementing action. A request for federal action
or approval to implement specific noise compatibility measures may be required, and an FAA decision on the request
may require an environmental assessment of the proposed action. Approval does not constitute a commitment by the
FAA to financially assist in the implementation of the program nor a determination that all measures covered by the
program are eligible for grant-in-aid funding from the FAA. Where federal funding is sought, request for project
grant must be submitted to the Airports District Office at the location identified in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

clause above. The City of South Lake Tahoe submitted to the FAA on September 24, 1992, the Noise Exposure Maps, descriptions,
and other documentation produced during the noise compatibility planning study conducted from January 1984 through
December 1991. The Lake Tahoe Airport noise exposure maps were determined by FAA to be in compliance with applicable
requirements on May 18, 1994. Notice of this determination was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on June 8, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Lake Tahoe Airport Study contains proposed noise compatibility program comprised on actions designed for phased
implementation by airport management and adjacent jurisdictions from the date of study completion to (or beyond)
the year 2000. It was requested that the FAA evaluate and approve this material as a noise compatibility program as
described in Section 104(b) of the Act. The FAA began its review of the program on November 14, 1994, and was required
by a provision of the Act to approve or disapprove the program within 180-days (other than the use of new flight procedures
for noise control). Failure to approve or disapprove such program within the 180-days period shall be deemed to be
an approval of such a program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The submitted program contained seventeen (17) proposed actions for noise mitigation on and off the airport. The
FAA completed its review and determined that the procedural and substantive requirements of the Act and FAR Part 150
have been satisfied. The overall program, therefore, was approved by the Associate Administrator for Airports effective
November 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Outright approval was granted for thirteen (13) of the specific program elements. The approved elements included

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice informs interested parties that the Department of the Treasury has directed its fiscal agent, the Federal
Reserve, to change the method of determining the value of collateral pledged by depositaries to secure Treasury Tax
and Loan (TT&amp;L) deposits. Current regulations published in the Code of Federal Regulations provide that collateral
will be accepted at values assigned by the Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs). This change in collateral valuation is being
implemented concurrently and in a manner consistent with the FRBs' new valuation methodology for collateral pledged
by financial institutions to secure borrowings from the Federal Reserve. The current FRB methodology for TT&amp;L
and the discount window generally values securities at par value to which margins may be applied; the new methodology
will value collateral at market prices, where available, to which margins may be applied. In addition, the FRBs are
currently developing a uniform methodology to value definitive collateral for which no market prices are available.
These changes will assign more equitable values to collateral.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Financial Management Service (Service), acting through the Federal Reserve as fiscal agent of the United States,
designates Treasury Tax and Loan (TT&amp;L) depositaries. Current regulations promulgated in the Code of Federal
Regulations provide that collateral will be accepted at values assigned by the Federal Reserve Banks (FRBs). 31 CFR
203.14(d). Currently, the FRBs value pledged collateral at the outstanding principal balance or the outstanding
principal balance reduced by a margin. A margin, or haircut, is the deduction of a certain percentage of the value of
the collateral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces the FRBs' new methodology for valuing TT&amp;L collateral. Under the new methodology, the
FRBs will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value the collateral using market prices, where available, or determine a value based on risk characteristics. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The resulting final collateral value assigned by the FRBs may be more or less than par value. This new valuation system
is intended to increase the accuracy of the value assigned to collateral in relation to the deposits at risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new valuation methodology will be implemented in phases, beginning January 1, 1995. Phase 1 will encompass definitive
securities for which reliable and active markets exist, and for which market pricing is available to the FRBs. Initially,
the margin applied in phase 1 will be the existing margins. These margins may be modified later. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Phase 2, to be implemented later in 1995, will cover all remaining definitive collateral. The FRBs will value this
definitive collateral, for which a reliable and active market does not exist, using an enhanced valuation methodology.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lastly, the FRBs will value collateral held in book-entry form at the FRBs using a market based methodology in approximately
2 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has sent to all TT&amp;L depositaries, a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Special Notice to Depositaries,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 which provided additional information on this change in the method of collateral valuation. In addition, the Federal
Reserve has provided depositaries a separate information package.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Veterans Affairs gives notice under Public Law 92&hyph;463 (Federal Advisory Committee Act) as
amended, by section 5(c) of Public Law 94&hyph;409 that a meeting of the Rehabilitation Research and Development
Scientific Review and Evaluation Board Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee for Cooperative Studies, and Health
Services and Rehabilitation Research and Development will be held at the Vista International Hotel, 1400 ``M'' Street
NW., Washington, DC, on January 10 through January 13, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The session on January 10, 1995, is scheduled to begin at 6:30 p.m. and end at 9:30 p.m. The sessions on January 11, 12,
13, 1995, are scheduled to begin at 8 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. The purpose of the meeting is to review rehabilitation research
and development applications for scientific and technical merit and to make recommendations to the Director, Rehabilitation
Research and Development Services, regarding their funding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meeting will be open to the public up to the seating capacity of the room for the January 10 session for the discussion
of administrative matters, the general status of the program, and the administrative details of the review process.
On January 11&hyph;13, 1995 the meeting is closed during which the Board will be reviewing research and development
applications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This review involves oral comments, discussion of site visits, staff, and consultant critiques of proposed research
protocols, and similar analytical documents that necessitate the consideration of the personal qualifications,
performance and competence of individual research investigators. Disclosure of such information would constitute
a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Disclosure would also reveal research proposals and research
underway which could lead to the loss of these projects to third parties and thereby frustrate future agency research
efforts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the closing is in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 522b(c)(6), and (c)(9)(B) and the determination of the Secretary
of the Department of Veterans Affairs under Sections 10(d) of Pub. L. 92&hyph;463 as amended by Section 5(c) of Pub.
L. 94&hyph;409.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the limited seating capacity of the room, those who plan to attend the open session should write to Ms. Victoria
Mongiardo, Program Analyst, Rehabilitation Research and Development Service, Department of Veterans Affairs,
103 South Gay Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21202 (Phone: 410&hyph;962&hyph;2563) at least five days before the meeting.

Notice of Vote to Close Meeting
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By telephone vote on December 21, 1994, a majority of the members contacted and voting, the Board of Governors of the
United States Postal Service voted to add to the agenda of its meeting closed to public observation on January 9, 1995,
in Washington, D.C. (see 59 FR 64014, December 12, 1994), consideration of a funding request for the Santa Barbara,
California, Processing &amp; Distribution Center.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The meeting is expected to be attended by the following persons: Governors Alvarado, Daniels, del Junco, Dyhrkopp,
Mackie, Pace and Winters; Postmaster General Runyon, Deputy Postmaster General Coughlin, Secretary to the Board
Harris, and General Counsel Elcano.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c)(9)(B) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(i) of
Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the discussion of this matter is exempt from the open meeting requirement of
the Government in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose information, the premature
disclosure of which would significantly frustrate proposed procurement actions. The Board further determined
that the public interest does not require that the Board's discussion of the matter be open to the public.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal
Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting
may properly be closed to public observation pursuant to section 552b(c)(9)(B) of Title 5, United States Code and
section 7.3(i) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice provides instructions to applicants for Federal assistance under JTPA Title IV, Migrant and Seasonal
Farmworker Programs for PY 1995, and consists of: Part I_Introduction; and Part II_Solicitation for Grant Application
(SGA). Part II constitute invitations from the Department of Labor (DOL) for public agencies, and private nonprofit
organizations authorized by their Charters or Articles of Incorporation to provide training and employment and
other services described in this notice to submit funding applications for Migrant and Seasonal Farmworker Programs
for PY 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Part I_Introduction and Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
JTPA establishes programs to prepare youth and unskilled adults for entry into the labor force, and to afford job training
to those economically disadvantaged individuals and others facing serious barriers to employment who are in special
need of such training to obtain productive employment. In accordance with 29 U.S.C. 1501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., regulations promulgated by DOL to implement JTPA are set forth at parts 626 through 638 and 1005 of Title 20, Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated at 20 CFR 633.102, it is the purpose of section 402 of JTPA, 29 U.S.C. 1672, to provide job training, employment
opportunities, and other services for those individuals who suffer chronic seasonal unemployment and underemployment
in the agriculture industry. These conditions have been substantially aggravated by continual advancements in
technology and mechanization resulting in displacement and contribute significantly to the Nation's rural employment
problem. These factors substantially affect the entire national economy. Because of the special nature of farmworker
employment and training problems, such programs are centrally administered at the national level. Programs and
activities supported under this section shall, in accordance with section 402(c)(3) of JTPA: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Enable farmworkers and their dependents to obtain or retain employment;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Allow participation in other program activities leading to their eventual placement in unsubsidized agricultural
or nonagricultural employment;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Allow activities leading to stabilization in agricultural employment; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Include related assistance and supportive services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations promulgated by DOL to implement the provisions of Title IV, section 402, of JTPA are set forth in 20 CFR
part 633 and part 636. In addition, State and local governments and Native American applicants must conform to Administrative
Requirements at 29 CFR part 97. Non-profit organizations must conform to Administrative Regulations at 29 CFR part
95. Migrant and other seasonally employed farmworker programs are also subject to 29 CFR parts 93 (New Restrictions
on Lobbying), 96 (Audit Requirements for Grants, Contracts and other agreements), and 98 (Disbarment, Suspension
and Drug-free Workplace requirements). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should the regulations at parts 633 and 636 conflict with regulations elsewhere in 20 CFR, the regulations at parts
633 and 636 shall control with respect to programs and activities governed by these Parts. 20 CFR 633.103(b). Further,
should any instructions in this notice conflict with JTPA regulations, the JTPA regulations shall control. Applicants
should consult and be familiar with 20 CFR part 633 in its entirety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 20 CFR 633.201, DOL will not consider any funding application when fraud or criminal activity has been
proven to exist within the applicant organization, or when efforts by the DOL to recover debts established by final
agency action have been unsuccessful. Prior to the final selection of an applicant as a potential grantee, DOL will
conduct a Responsibility Review of the available records to establish an organization's overall responsibility
to administer Federal funds in accordance with 20 CFR 633.204. Any applicant which is not considered or selected as
a potential grantee because of these provisions shall be advised of its appeal rights.

Comments From the States
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' and the implementing regulations at
29 CFR part 17, are applicable to this program. Pursuant to these requirements, in States which have established a
consultation process expressly covering this program, applications shall be provided to the State for comment.
Since States also may participate as competitors for this program, applications shall be submitted to the State upon
the deadline for submission to DOL. 20 CFR 633.202(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To strengthen the implementation of E.O. 12372, DOL specifies the following timeframe for its treatment of comments
from the State's Single Point of Contact (SPOC) on JTPA section 402 applications: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. As required by 29 CFR 17.8(a)(2), the SPOC must submit comments, if any, to DOL no later than 60 days after the deadline
date for applications;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. DOL will forward those comments to the applicant within 10 days of their receipt from the SPOC;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The applicant must submit its response to the SPOC's comments, if any, to DOL no later than 10 days after the date of
receipt from DOL; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. DOL will notify the SPOC of its decision regarding the comments and response, but will not implement that decision
for at least 10 days after the SPOC has been notified.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
DOL is soliciting applications for grants under the provisions of JTPA Title IV, section 402, to provide training,

Review of Funding Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications will be reviewed and rated by a competitive review panel, using the specific review standards cited
at 20 CFR 633.203. Panel results are advisory in nature and are not binding on the Grant Officer. In addition, prior
to the final selection of an applicant as a potential grantee, DOL will conduct a Responsibility Review of the available
records pursuant to 20 CFR 633.204. This review is intended to establish overall responsibility to administer Federal
funds and is independent of the competitive process. Applicants failing to meet the requirements of that or other
sections of the regulations will not be selected as potential grantees irrespective of their standing in the competition.

and representatives of Government employee organizations, conduct periodic investigations of the cost of operating
privately owned vehicles (automobiles, airplanes, and motorcycles) to Government employees while on official
travel and report the results to Congress at least once a year. The law further requires that a determination of the
