SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board is adopting a final rule amending the anti-tying provisions of Regulation Y to permit a bank holding company
or its nonbank subsidiary to offer a discount on its product or service on condition that a customer obtain any other
product or service from that company or from any of its nonbank affiliates. Thus, the final rule would generally remove
Board-imposed restrictions on tying when no bank is involved in the arrangement and the products are separately available
for purchase by the customer. The Board believes that the amendment will relieve bank holding companies of a competitive
disadvantage, promote efficiency in the delivery of services, and provide benefits for consumers.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1972) generally prohibits a bank from
tying a product or service to another product or service offered by the bank or by any of its affiliates. A bank engages
in a tie for purposes of section 106 by: (1) Offering a discount on a product or service (the ``tying product'') on the
condition that a customer obtain some additional product or service (the ``tied product'') from the bank or from any
of its affiliates; or (2) allowing the purchase of a product or service only if a customer purchases another product
from the bank or from any of its affiliates. Although section 106 applies only when a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bank
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 offers the tying product, the Board in 1971 extended section 106 to products offered by bank holding companies and
their nonbank subsidiaries. 12 CFR 225.7(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On July 27, 1994, the Board proposed an amendment to conform the anti-tying provisions of Regulation Y more closely
to section 106 and its focus on banks. 59 FR 39709 (August 4, 1994). The proposed amendment would permit bank holding
companies and their nonbank subsidiaries to offer discounts on packaged products when: (1) Both the tying and tied
products are offered by bank holding companies or their nonbank subsidiaries_in other words, when no affiliated
bank was involved in the arrangement; and (2) both the tying and tied products are separately available for purchase
at competitive prices. If the package arrangement included a product offered by an affiliated bank, the proposed
amendment would not apply (although the arrangement might qualify for another exception adopted by the Board).

General Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board received 31 comments on its proposal. Those commenting included 17 banking organizations, eight trade
associations, and five Reserve Banks. Commenters overwhelmingly supported the proposed amendment. One banking
trade association opposed the Board's proposal because it believed that a blanket exception could have anti-competitive
effects in small towns. This commenter recommended that the Board act on exemption requests on a case-by-case basis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board is adopting the amendment substantially as proposed. It is important to note that the amendment is not an
exception to section 106, which applies only when a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bank
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 offers the tying product_that is, when a bank is varying the consideration or conditioning the availability of a product
in order to create an incentive for the customer to purchase another product.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
offer all of the packaged products_a case that would otherwise be covered by the Board's extension of section 106 to
tying within a bank holding company organization.

The purpose of section 106 was to prevent banks from using their market power over certain products to gain an unfair
competitive advantage in other products. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See, e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
, S. Rep. No. 1084, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 16 (1970). Although banks, like their nonbank competitors, already were subject
to general antitrust prohibitions on tying, Congress concluded that special restrictions were necessary given
the unique role of banks in the economy. Section 106's restrictions on banks are broader than those of the antitrust
laws, as no proof of economic power in the tying product or anti-competitive effects in the tied product market are
required for a violation to occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment will not permit the types of anti-competitive practices that the Board's regulatory extension was
designed to prevent. Neither bank holding companies nor their nonbanking subsidiaries generally appear to possess
sufficient market power in the products that they offer to impair competition.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Moreover, bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries will continue to be restricted by the antitrust
laws_the same restrictions that bind their non-bank holding company competitors_and the Board will retain the authority
to terminate or modify any arrangement that resulted in anti-competitive practices. Section 106 will continue to
restrict tying by banks, and Regulation Y will continue to restrict tying by a nonbank when the tied product is offered
by an affiliated bank. Finally, the amendment will rescind Regulation Y's restrictions on tying between nonbanks
only where discounting is involved and the products are separately available.

For example, the ``laundry list'' activities in which bank holding companies and their nonbanking subsidiaries
are permitted to engage are generally conducted in competitive national or regional markets that are characterized
by large numbers of actual or potential competitors and low barriers to entry.

The final rule is further justified by the competitive environment in which bank holding companies and their nonbank
subsidiaries operate nationwide. The amendment will relieve bank holding companies of a competitive disadvantage,
promote efficiency in the delivery of services, and provide benefits for consumers. In particular, the amendment
will provide customers with greater choices and potentially lower costs by allowing bank holding companies to offer
the same types of discounts that their competitors already offer.

Other Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board sought public comment on several particulars of the proposed amendment, including: (1) The Board's requirement
that all products offered in a package arrangement be separately available for purchase; (2) that these products
be separately available ``at competitive prices''; and (3) the Board's clarification that its authority to revoke
an exception that is resulting in anti-competitive practices includes authority to halt such practices at an individual
institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters were split on the proposed requirement that all products in a package arrangement be separately available
for purchase, with five in favor and seven opposed. The requirement of separate availability, like the requirement
that the arrangement involve a discount, effectively prevents a bank holding company from conditioning the availability
of one product on the purchase of another. In a competitive market, a company should be unable to profit from such an
arrangement_as customers are free to purchase the desired, tying product from a competitor without having to purchase
the less desired, tied product. Although, as noted, the markets for products offered by bank holding company affiliates
are generally competitive, there may be a few markets that are less competitive, and the discounting and separate
availability restrictions would therefore act as a further safeguard to protect against anti-competitive practices
in such markets. Accordingly, these requirements will be retained.

 The proposed rule contained specific language emphasizing that all products in a package arrangement must be separately
available for purchase by the customer. Because all anti-tying exceptions granted by the Board already are subject
to this requirement, this language has been deleted in the final rule to avoid redundancy.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters generally opposed the addition of a clarifying phrase providing that products be separately available
``at competitive prices,'' with four in favor and seven opposed. The purpose of this clarification was to prevent
evasion of the separate availability and discounting requirements. Such an evasion could occur by establishing
the price of a product so far above its package price that customers would effectively be required to purchase the package
in order to obtain the product. The effect would be the same as an explicit conditioning of the availability of the product,
as described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters expressed concern about the difficulties of determining what constitutes a competitive price, particularly
in products that are unusual or unique. Because of these concerns, the Board has not adopted this clarification but
will continue to interpret ``separately available'' to mean available at a price that would generally attract customers
and therefore leaves customers desiring a product a meaningful choice between purchasing the product alone or through
a package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters did not object to the Board's retained authority to revoke an exception that is resulting in anti-competitive
practices or the Board's ability to halt such practices at an individual institution. The Board has retained such
authority in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Additional Relief Requested by the Commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters suggested that the Board grant additional relief from the tying restrictions of section 106 and
Regulation Y. In particular, nine commenters recommended that the Board completely repeal the extension of section
106 to bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. Commenters also suggested that the Board extend the
proposed amendment to allow a nonbank subsidiary of a bank holding company to offer a discount on a product or service
to a customer who purchases a product or service from a bank affiliate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven commenters recommended revisions to the regulatory traditional bank product exception recently adopted
by the Board.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The commenters requested that the Board extend the regulatory traditional bank product exception beyond cases where
only traditional bank products are part of the package. These commenters noted that the statutory traditional bank
product exception permits a bank to tie any product (not just a traditional bank product) to a traditional bank product,
and suggested that the same exception should apply to ties between affiliates. Finally, several commenters requested
that the Board clarify the treatment of operating subsidiaries of banks under section 106 and further expand the definition
of traditional bank products.

 12 CFR 225.7(b)(1). Section 106 contains an explicit exception (the ``statutory traditional bank product exception'')
that permits a bank to tie any product or service to a loan, discount, deposit, or trust service (a traditional bank
product) offered by that bank. The regulatory traditional bank product exception partially extends the statutory
traditional bank product exception by permitting a bank or any of its affiliates to vary the consideration for a traditional
bank product on condition that the customer obtain another traditional bank product from an affiliate. In other words,
a bank may offer a customer a discount on one product (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 a deposit account) if the customer obtains another product (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is classifying four temporomandibular joint (TMJ) implants, the total temporomandibular
joint prosthesis, the glenoid fossa prosthesis, the mandibular condyle prosthesis, and the interarticular disc
prosthesis (interpositional implant), into class III (premarket approval). These actions are being taken under
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (the 1976 amendments)
and the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (the SMDA).

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 18, 1992 (57 FR 43165), FDA issued a proposed rule to classify certain TMJ implants into class III. Initially,
FDA provided for interested persons to submit written comments on the proposal by November 17, 1992. In response to
a request for an extension of the comment period, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of December 1, 1992 (57 FR 56876), FDA extended the comment period until December 8, 1992. Subsequently, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 14, 1994 (59 FR 6935), FDA reproposed to classify two TMJ implants, the mandibular condyle prosthesis
and the glenoid fossa prosthesis, into class III (premarket approval) to reflect the recommendation of the Dental
Products Panel (the panel) with respect to the classification of these devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Response to Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency received 54 comments responding to the proposed rule and one comment responding to the reproposed rule.
These comments were submitted by a law firm, oral and maxillofacial surgeons who placed TMJ implants, manufacturers
and distributors of TMJ implants, and TMJ implant recipients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. In the preamble to the proposed rule, FDA advised interested persons that the agency lacked evidence that the total
TMJ prosthesis was legally in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. If the device was first introduced into
interstate commerce after May 28, 1976, it would be in class III in accordance with section 513 of the act (21 U.S.C.
360c). FDA specifically requested comments on this issue. In response, FDA received several comments stating that
the total TMJ prosthesis was legally in commercial distribution in the United States before May 28, 1976, and one comment
to the contrary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has determined, from information submitted in comments, that two firms, TMJ Implants, Inc., Golden, CO, and the
Temporomandibular Joint Research Foundation, La Cresenta, CA, were commercially distributing the total TMJ prosthesis
in the United States on or before May 28, 1976. Thus, the agency has concluded that the total TMJ prosthesis is, in fact,
a preamendments device and should be classified along with the other TMJ implants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Several comments stated that classification of TMJ implants into class III (premarket approval) might result
in the unavailability of these devices for clinical use or in a movement to ban them. One manufacturer of total TMJ implants
stated that, if the total TMJ implant is classified into class III, the expense of preparing a PMA would force that manufacturer
to discontinue marketing the device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the statute, FDA classifies a device into class III, and subsequently requires submission of PMA's for the device,
when FDA has determined that premarket approval is necessary to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness
of the device. The classification of a device, therefore, is based on considerations related to the safety or effectiveness
of the device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees that classifying TMJ implants into class III will necessarily result in the unavailability and/or
the banning of these devices because of the procedural safeguards contained in the statute. The effect of classifying
a device into class III is to provide each manufacturer of the device with sufficient time to conduct necessary testing
of the device (a minimum of 30 months) and then to submit a PMA to FDA by a date to be set in a future regulation under section
515(b) of the act (21 U.S.C. 360e(b)(1)). That regulation is promulgated using notice-and-comment rulemaking,
in conjunction with which manufacturers are permitted to petition for reclassification. Moreover, pursuant to
section 501(f) of the act (21 U.S.C. 351(f)(1)), a preamendments device may continue to be sold throughout this time
period and while a PMA is pending. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is not attempting to ban TMJ implants by classifying them into class III. In fact, by eventually requiring submission
of PMA's for these devices, FDA will be giving manufacturers the opportunity to establish that the devices are safe
and effective. The classification of a device into class III neither results in nor is it related to the banning of a
device under section 516 of the act (21 U.S.C. 360f). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Several comments stated that, for reconstruction of the temporomandibular joint, non-Proplast
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 TMJ implant devices are superior to autogenous materials. One comment stated that partial fossa protheses are safe
and effective. Comments from patients and TMJ prostheses manufacturers stated that they experienced favorable
results following implantation of the total TMJ prosthesis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In classifying these devices, FDA is determining the level of regulatory control needed to provide reasonable assurance
of their safety and effectiveness. Whether non-Proplast
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 TMJ implants are superior in safety and effectiveness to autogenous materials, or whether partial fossa prostheses
are perceived as safe and effective, is not relevant to this determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 513(a)(3) of the act, the agency relies on valid scientific evidence to determine the classification
of a device. According to &sect;860.7(c)(2) (21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)), valid scientific evidence includes evidence
from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched
controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience
with a marketed device. Valid scientific evidence does not include isolated case reports, random experience, reports
lacking sufficient details to permit scientific evaluation, or unsubstantiated opinions. Thus, the isolated case
reports, random testimonials, and unsubstantiated opinions received in response to the proposed rule cannot be
regarded as valid scientific evidence upon which the classification of TMJ implants can be based. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. One comment stated that the agency's failure to provide the panel information relating to TMJ devices made of materials
other than Proplast
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 limited the panel's consideration and should limit the scope of its classification recommendation accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with this comment. As stated in the legislative history of the Medical Device Amendments of 1976: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In requiring a panel's classification recommendation to include a summary of the reasons for the recommendation
and a summary of the data upon which the recommendation is based, the objective is to assure that the record accurately
reflects the basis for the panel's recommendations. The use of the term ``data'' is not intended to refer only to the
results of scientific experiments but should also consist of less formal evidence, other scientific information,
or judgments of experts when available. The requirement is not intended to imply that a panel must have received evidence
with respect to safety and effectiveness of a device before it can make a classification recommendation. Under this
premise, the burden of providing evidence substantiating the safety and effectiveness of a device rests on the manufacturers,
and the absence of sufficient data may be referred to in a panel's recommendation as the reason for classification
of a device into class III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(See H. Rept. No. 94&hyph;853, 94th Cong., 2d sess. 40 (1976), p. 40).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. One comment asserted that the references cited by FDA in the proposed rule classifying the total TMJ implant did
not exist at the time of the panel meeting and, therefore, could not have been evaluated by the panel when making its
recommendation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with this comment. It is true that some of the information cited by FDA in support of its proposed classification
of the total TMJ implant did not exist at the time of the panel's April 21, 1989, meeting. However, the proposed rule
reflected not only the panel's recommendations, but also FDA's determinations regarding the proper classification
of these devices. The proposed rule did not state or imply that the panel relied on all the data cited by the agency in
support of the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Several comments suggested that, when classifying these devices, FDA should distinguish TMJ prostheses containing
Proplast
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from those not containing that material. These comments recommended that only devices containing Proplast
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should be classified. Some comments stated that the risks to health identified in the proposed rule are based only
on data associated with the failure of TMJ prostheses containing Proplast
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. One comment stated that Proplast
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 implants and non-Proplast
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 implants (specifically cobalt chrome and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) prostheses) should be classified separately
because the difference in the material used in these implants significantly affects their safety and effectiveness.
Several comments stated that surgeons and TMJ implant manufacturers had observed no specific cases of the risks to
health identified in the proposed rule in several patients implanted with a non-Proplast
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 total TMJ prosthesis. Some comments stated that these risks to health were not observed in patients implanted with
TMJ prostheses manufactured by specific manufacturers. In contrast, several comments said that these risks were
observed often in patients implanted with TMJ implants containing Proplast
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to &sect;860.5(c)(3), when FDA initially classifies a device, it may consider safety and effectiveness
data developed for other devices of the same generic type. A generic type of device includes devices that do not differ
significantly in purpose, design, material, energy source, function, or any other feature related to safety and
effectiveness, and for which similar regulatory controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety
and effectiveness (see &sect;860.3(i)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The transcript of the April 21, 1989, panel meeting demonstrates that the panel considered TMJ implants composed
of various materials, i.e., silicone, Proplast
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
TM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, dural grafts, fascia, vitallium, acrylic, meniscle and silastic, before making its recommendations with respect
to classification. Evidence submitted during the panel meeting revealed that similar risks and similar safety and
effectiveness concerns are associated with all TMJ implants, regardless of material composition. Based on the evidence
provided, the panel concluded that TMJ devices composed of different materials raise the same safety and effectiveness
questions. Thus, the panel concluded, and FDA agrees, that TMJ implants of all materials should be regulated within
the four generic types of devices identified because the devices do not differ significantly in the safety and effectiveness
questions raised and, consequently, similar regulatory controls will be needed to provide reasonable assurance
of their safety and effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Comments stated that one of the health risks identified in the proposed rule, loosening of the total TMJ prosthesis,
is directly related to the health of the bone at the implant interface. These comments asserted that loosening of the
device does not occur unless there is a void of suitable bone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, FDA has determined that the screws used to anchor the implant may loosen,
resulting in implant loosening or displacement which may cause changes in bite, difficulty in chewing, limited joint
function and unpredictable wear on implant components (see Refs. 2 through 5). The agency has not received any new
information to cause FDA to change its opinion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Some comments asserted that FDA should classify all the TMJ implants into class II because special controls would
allow the agency to impose special conditions on these devices, such as postmarket surveillance. One of these comments,
received from a TMJ implant manufacturer, recommended that FDA classify TMJ cobalt-chrome-PMMA implants into class
II.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with these comments. FDA believes that insufficient information exists to establish that special
controls would provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of these devices. FDA believes that
a PMA is necessary to provide such assurance. Furthermore, postmarket surveillance is not limited to class II devices.
Thus, at some future time, FDA may request that manufacturers of TMJ implants conduct postmarket surveillance of
these devices.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. One comment urged that the total temporomandibular joint prosthesis and the interarticular implant be given high
priority in calling for PMA's. One comment disagreed, stating that FDA cannot give the total TMJ prosthesis high priority
in calling for PMA's when the panel recommended low priority. Another comment expressed concern that manufacturers
of these prostheses will not have to submit PMA's to FDA for at least 21/2 years and will be permitted to market the devices
in the interim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to sections 501(f) and 515(b) of the act, TMJ implant manufacturers may continue to commercially distribute
their devices without filing a PMA for 30 months after the effective date of the final rule classifying these implants
into class III or until 90 days after FDA issues a final rule requiring premarket approval for the devices, whichever
is later. Moreover, section 515(i) of the act shows a clear congressional intent that FDA move forward with requiring
the submission of PMA's for all preamendments devices. Thus, regardless of the priority assigned for calling for
PMA's, eventually PMA's will be required for all class III preamendments devices that are not reclassified. Furthermore,
it should be noted that a panel recommendation is only a recommendation that FDA may adopt or reject. FDA believes that
it is appropriate to require PMA's for all TMJ implants as soon as possible under the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Two comments objected that the glenoid fossa prosthesis and the mandibular condyle prosthesis should not be classified
into class III because the panel did not recommend that they be classified into class III. Subsequent to issuing the
proposed rule, the panel reconvened on February 11, 1993, and recommended that the mandibular condyle prosthesis
and the glenoid fossa prosthesis be classified into class III. Based on this recommendation, FDA issued a reproposed
rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of February 14, 1994 (59 FR 6935), to classify the devices into class III. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. One comment stated that the classification process for the TMJ implants was flawed and should be reinitiated because
of events which transpired between the April 1989 panel recommendation and the issuance of the proposed rule. During
this time, the SMDA was passed. Among other things, the SMDA changed the classification definitions for medical devices.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with this comment. It is the agency's position that the SMDA does not require the agency to obtain a new
classification recommendation from a panel which had recommended classification under the previous standard.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated previously, the agency is not bound to adopt a panel's recommendation. Moreover, in light of the significant
risks to health identified by the panel, FDA believes it is extremely unlikely that the panel would have recommended
that the devices be classified into class II under the new definition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. On its own initiative, FDA has deleted the words, ``naturally occurring'' from the identifications of glenoid
fossa prosthesis and mandibular condyle prosthesis because the standard of care now indicates that these devices
may now interface not only with naturally occurring surfaces but also with artificial surfaces.

IV. Environmental Imapct

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(e)(2) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Analysis of Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;54). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the regulatory philosophy and principles identified
in the Executive Order. In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive
Order and so is not subject to review under the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Because this rule does not impose any new requirements, the agency certifies that
the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is required.

 With this action, EPA allocates potential production allowances to producers who have baseline allowances for the
production of methyl bromide. These potential production allowances are intended solely for the production of methyl
bromide for export to Article 5 countries, as defined under Article 5 of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete
the Ozone Layer. In drafting the accelerated phaseout rule, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 10, 1993, the Agency inadvertently omitted methyl bromide from the list of chemicals for which potential
production allowances were granted. Today's action correctly allocates potential production allowances for all
control periods beginning January 1, 1994, and ending before January 1, 2001, equal to 10 percent of a company's baseline
production allowances. The Agency may propose potential production allowances for methyl bromide for control periods
after January 1, 2001, at a later date. Today's action makes the above-mentioned correction while maintaining the
goals of the accelerated phaseout to protect human health and the environment.

When Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (the Protocol) first met in 1987,
they agreed in Article 2H to allow additional production of controlled substances beyond the levels being set for
the developed countries for developing countries. The United States, as well as other Parties to the Protocol, recognized
the need to continue to supply controlled substances to developing countries during the period of scheduled reductions
and for a limited time after the phaseout of production of controlled substances. Under Article 5 of the Protocol,
developing countries are defined as Parties to the Protocol consuming less than 0.3 kilograms per capita of class
I, Group I and II controlled substances. These Article 5 countries have limited resources to adopt alternative technologies
to replace the phased out controlled substances. To ensure that such countries do not purchase the technologies to
produce controlled substances and otherwise bypass controls on controlled substances, the Parties to the Protocol
agreed to provide a set-aside level of production for Article 5 countries. Article 5 countries must ensure that these
imported controlled substances are used to meet basic domestic needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implements a program domestically that limits and monitors production
and consumption of controlled substances, including methyl bromide. Production for Article 5 countries in the United
States is monitored by allocating potential production allowances to those companies that have baseline production
allowances. Since 1989, EPA has allocated potential production allowances equal to 10 percent of baseline production
allowances for specific controlled substances. EPA grants authorization to producers to convert potential production
allowances to production allowances once they have exported to an Article 5 country. The July 30, 1992,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the October 14, 1994 proposal to grant potential production allowances for methyl bromide, EPA discussed the inadvertent
omission of the allocation of these allowances in the final rule published December 10, 1993 (58 FR 65018). In drafting
the December 10, 1993 final rule, EPA focused on the level of control of methyl bromide and its phaseout, but inadvertently
failed to allocate additional production allowances of methyl bromide for exports to Article 5 countries. Due to
this oversight, EPA proposed on October 14 to allocate potential production allowances to methyl bromide producers
equal to 10 percent of their baseline production allowances beginning in the current control period (which began
January 1, 1994). Because section 82.11 indicates that authorizations to convert potential production allowances
to production allowances are valid during the control period in which the controlled substance departed the United
States, companies may use these potential production allowances for methyl bromide only for the control period in
which the shipment departed the United States. The 10 percent level of additional production for Article 5 countries
would continue until the effective date of the phaseout of production of methyl bromide, January 1, 2001. Section
602(d) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 establishes the phaseout date for methyl bromide by stating that production
may not extend beyond ``a date more than seven years after January 1 of the year after the year in which the substance
is added to the list of class I substances.'' Methyl bromide was added to the list of class I substances in 1993. With
this proposal, EPA is reserving action in allocating potential production allowances for control periods starting
January 1, 2001, and beyond.

a. General Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received three comments on the proposed allocation of potential production allowances for methyl bromide. Two
of these comments support the allocation of potential production allowances for methyl bromide for export to Article
5 countries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The two supporting comments agree with EPA's proposal stating that: ``(1) The Agency has the legal authority to adopt
this amendment; (2) there is a serious need for this amendment; and (3) this amendment will have no adverse environmental
consequences.'' The legal authority to grant potential production allowances for methyl bromide was discussed
in the proposal published October 14, 1994 (59 FR 52126). One of the two supporting comments acknowledged that, ``there
is no contrary authority (within the Montreal Protocol or the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990) to these provisions;
therefore, EPA has the legal authority to promulgate this amendment to 40 CFR Part 82.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The two comments state, and EPA agrees, that the need for this amendment to allocate potential production allowances
for methyl bromide stems from a need to maintain competitiveness in world markets for U.S. methyl bromide producers.
Without the additional production allowances, U.S. companies are placed at a competitive disadvantage relative
to other producers of methyl bromide in developed countries for the methyl bromide markets in Article 5 countries.
The demand within Article 5 countries for methyl bromide is smaller than the potential global supply as currently
allowed under the Montreal Protocol (100 percent of 1991 levels plus the 10 percent to meet basic domestic needs in
Article 5 countries). Therefore, methyl bromide will be produced and exported to Article 5 countries, regardless
of whether it is supplied by U.S. companies or another Party. EPA believes that it is important for U.S. producers of
methyl bromide to continue to maintain their position in these markets as international contacts will enable U.S.
companies to lead the global transition to alternative pesticides other than methyl bromide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The two comments state, and EPA agrees, that the allocation of potential production allowances to U.S. companies
for the export of methyl bromide to Article 5 countries will not have a detrimental environmental impact. The allocation
of potential production allowances for methyl bromide to U.S. companies will not change global emissions; nor will
global emissions increase if such additional allowances are granted. Because the demand for methyl bromide from
Article 5 countries is limited, the percent of methyl bromide that will be emitted during the use and application of
methyl bromide will be the same, regardless of the supplier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The provisions in the Protocol for additional production to meet the basic domestic needs of Article 5 countries were
included by the Parties for sound environmental policy reasons. The additional production provided in the U.S. by
potential production allowances is designed to meet the basic domestic needs of Article 5 countries. The Parties
felt it would be preferable to meet the basic domestic needs of Article 5 countries through production and exports
from existing facilities than through construction of new production facilities in Article 5 countries. If Article
5 countries were to build new production facilities, the level of production would not be subject to the same controls
as those in developed countries and more methyl bromide would potentially be produced over a longer time period because
Article 5 countries have a 10-year grace period beyond the phaseout date for the various ozone-depleting substances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The third comment EPA received on the October 14, 1994, proposal was from an environmental group that also expressed
support for the Montreal Protocol and the potential production allowances for Article 5 countries. However, the
commenter expressed concern about EPA's argument justifying the quantity of allowances allocated. EPA does not
believe this is a valid concern as the quantity of allowances authorized to be allocated (the 10 percent additional
production for export to Article 5 countries) is not set unilaterally by EPA, but is derived from provisions of the
Protocol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The commenter also expressed concern with EPA's argument that if U.S. companies do not produce methyl bromide for
Article 5 countries, another Party will. The commenter indicated that if this view is adopted by other Parties, it
would encourage increased use and dependence on methyl bromide by Article 5 countries. EPA disagrees with these comments.
As stated above, the potential global supply of methyl bromide far exceeds current demand in Article 5 countries.
Therefore, there is no environmental benefit in denying U.S. companies the 10 percent additional production which
is granted under the Protocol. Protecting stratospheric ozone can only be achieved through a cooperative global
effort and EPA does not wish to put U.S. companies at a disadvantage in competing in the global methyl bromide market
unless there is an environmental benefit. In this case, EPA does not believe an environmental benefit would accrue
from a lesser allocation of potential production allowances for methyl bromide. Furthermore, denying the potential
production allowances intended by the Parties to the Protocol to be allocated to all producers of class I substances
at the 10 percent rate would be disadvantage producers without evidence of significant environmental detriment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The third comment also urged EPA to revisit the issue and ``to craft a more stringent regulation regarding the production
of methyl bromide for export to Article 5 countries.'' EPA believes that the 10 percent allocation of potential production
allowances for the export of methyl bromide to Article 5 countries in today's notice does not preclude future consideration
of more stringent regulations for methyl bromide. In fact, EPA is continuing to analyze methyl bromide's role in stratospheric
ozone depletion and the potential environmental and health benefits that could potentially be obtained through
further regulatory controls.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
b. Use of Allocation and Conversions During the Control Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the proposal of October 14, 1994, EPA stated that the allocation of potential production allowances for Article
5 countries may be retroactive to the beginning of the control period starting January 1, 1994. In this final action,
EPA allocates potential production allowances for the control period starting January 1, 1994, to those companies
with baseline production allowances for methyl bromide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received a comment that further clarification is needed that conversions of potential production allowances
into production allowances should also be made retroactive for the 1994 control period. As noted earlier, authorizations
to convert potential production allowances to production allowances are valid during the control period in which
the controlled substance was exported. Thus, EPA agrees with this comment and will process requests to convert potential
production allowances to production allowances for exports that occurred in the 1994 control period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will process authorizations to convert potential production allowances into production allowances for exports
that occur within the 1994 control period (before midnight of December 31, 1994) as long as the paperwork is received
by EPA before the final day of the first quarter of 1995. The current regulations refer to control periods and do not
prohibit companies from seeking authorizations to convert for quantities of methyl bromide exported, as long as
the export occurs in the same control period in which the production allowances are used. The export, conversion and
use of the production allowances must all occur within the same control period. Therefore, a company that receives
production allowances through a conversion during the first quarter of the year following the export will not be able
to use these allowances for production, but may use them to ensure compliance for the control period in which the export
occurred.

c. Production Levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With this amendment, EPA allocates to companies that produced methyl bromide in 1991 production up to 10 percent of
their baseline allowances for Article 5 countries for the control periods starting January 1, 1994, and ending before
January 1, 2001. EPA is setting the level at 10 percent to be consistent with Article 2H of the Montreal Protocol, and
to be consistent with the approach used for all Class I controlled substances except for Group VII, the hydrobromofluorocarbons
(no additional production for Article 5 countries is granted under the Protocol for these chemicals.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
d. Use of 1994 Potential Production Allowances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received a comment that requests a change in the procedures for the use of 1994 production allowances and/or consumption
allowances for methyl bromide exports to Article 5 countries. The commenter makes two proposals to rectify the granting
of potential production allowances late in the 1994 control period. The commenter requests that companies be able
to use production allowances converted from 1994 potential production allowances for six months into 1995. As a less
desirable alternative, the commenter suggests that, ``production using the converted potential production allowances
could occur in the 1994 control period without the requirement that consumption allowances be available at the time
of production.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with the suggestions for rectifying the late granting of potential production allowances in 1994 because
the Protocol establishes strict limits on production for Parties to the Protocol for each control period. Therefore,
EPA may not alter the definition of a control period, nor exceed the limits on production for a control period. EPA's
regulations lay out a system for allocating production and consumption allowances in accordance with the Protocol
to limit production and importation within control periods. Both production allowances and consumption allowances
are needed simultaneously, to be able to produce within a control period. To extend the use of allowances from one control
period into the following control period would be a violation of the United States commitments under the Montreal
Protocol to limit production. EPA will also not allow production without consumption allowances. This would set
an unacceptable precedent that is contrary to existing regulatory requirements and the Protocol. EPA suggests that
the companies continue to apply for consumption allowances for exports to Article 5 countries and use these to produce
in conjunction with existing production allowances and those requested for conversion from potential production
allowances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter added that the time taken to grant the conversion of potential production allowances to production allowances
``requires at least 3 weeks after the documentation is submitted to EPA.'' EPA believes that the average time taken
to process a request to convert is five days and almost never exceeds ten working days.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the October 14, 1994 proposal, EPA reserved the right to allocate potential production allowances after the phaseout
date for methyl bromide, starting January 1, 2001, and beyond. One comment was received suggesting EPA state an intention
to allocate potential production allowance, at some level, after the U.S. phaseout date. EPA intends to analyze the
role of methyl bromide in the depletion of stratospheric ozone as more scientific information is gathered over the
next few years. EPA also intends to monitor global and U.S. production of methyl bromide and its use. At this time, EPA
cannot predict the future actions relative to the post-phaseout period for methyl bromide. Based on the monitoring
and analysis activities, EPA will continue to consider proposing an allocation of potential production allowances
after the U.S. phaseout date for methyl bromide.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether this regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affect a sector of the economy,
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments
or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 It has been determined by OMB and EPA that this amendment to the final rule is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;602, requires that Federal agencies examine the impacts of their
regulations on small entities. Under 5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a general notice of
proposed rulemaking, it must prepare and make available for public comment an initial regulatory flexibility analysis
(RFA). Such an analysis is not required if the head of an agency certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 EPA believes that any impact that this amendment will have on the regulated community will serve only to provide relief
from otherwise applicable regulations, and will therefore limit the negative economic impact associated with the
regulations previously promulgated under Section 604 and 606. An examination of the impacts on small entities was
discussed in the final rule (58 FR 65018 and 58 FR 69235). That final rule assessed the impact the rule may have on small
entities. A separate regulatory impact analysis accompanied the final rule and is contained in Docket A&hyph;92&hyph;01.
I certify that this amendment to the accelerated phaseout rule will not have any additional negative economic impacts
on any small entities.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Home health services are furnished to the elderly and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disabled under the Hospital Insurance (Part A) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supplemental Medical Insurance (Part B) benefits of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare program. These services generally must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished by a home health agency (HHA) that participates in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Medicare program, be provided on a visiting basis in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiary's home and include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Part-time or intermittent nursing care furnished by or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the supervision of a registered nurse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Physical, occupational, or speech therapy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Medical social services under the direction of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Part-time or intermittent home health aide services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Medical supplies (other than drugs and biologicals) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
durable medical equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Services of interns and residents if the HHA is owned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by or affiliated with a hospital that has an approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical education program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exception to the requirement that services be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished in the home includes those services that require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the kinds of equipment that cannot be brought to the home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and are provided under arrangement with an HHA in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital, skilled nursing facility, or rehabilitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order for any home health services to be covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Medicare, specific requirements contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Social Security Act (the Act) must be met. Section 1861(m) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act requires that the services be furnished under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician. Sections 1814(a)(2)(C) and 1835(a)(2)(A) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act provide requirements for coverage under Part A and Part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B, respectively. Both sections require that a physician 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certify that the beneficiary is: Under a physician's care; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a plan of care established and periodically reviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a physician; confined to the home; and is in need of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis, physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therapy or speech pathology services, or has a continued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for occupational therapy when eligibility for home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health services has been established because of a prior need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for intermittent skilled nursing care, speech pathology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services, or physical therapy in the current or prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification period.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1861(m)(4) of the Act provides that before Medicare will cover home health aide services, the home health
aides must successfully complete a training and competency evaluation program approved by the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1861(dd) of the Act defines hospice care and sets forth the Medicare hospice care provisions. Under section
1861(dd)(1)(D)(i) of the Act, the services of a home health aide are covered as a hospice service only if the aide has
successfully completed a training and competency evaluation program that meets the requirements established by
the Secretary.

Medicare Home Health Care Initiative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the challenges facing the delivery of home health care, HCFA has recently undertaken the Medicare Home
Health Initiative to identify opportunities for improvement in the Medicare home health benefit. In our effort to
identify, develop and implement improvements, the initiative takes an integrated approach to the policy, quality
assurance, and operational elements of the benefit. To ensure that recommendations for improvement reflect the
everyday experience of individuals and organizations involved in home health care, we will include representatives
of home health consumers and providers as well as professional organizations, intermediaries, and States (including
State Medicaid agencies) in the ongoing development and implementation of improvements to the Medicare home health
benefit. The initial meeting between HCFA and these representatives was held on May 16, 17, and 18, 1994. Additional
meetings are planned in the coming months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although we proposed this rule before the Home Health Initiative began and so developed it independent of the initiative,
we consider the rule's provisions to be consistent with the goals of the initiative. A major goal of the initiative
is to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of Medicare home health benefit operational and administrative activities.
By clarifying several aspects of Medicare home health policy, this final rule promotes the consistent administration
of the home health benefit and therefore constitutes a significant effort to meet this goal.

Provisions of the Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 27, 1991 (56 FR 49154), we proposed to revise home health services regulations contained in 42 CFR part
409, subpart E; part 418, subpart D; and part 484, subpart C. The reader can find all of the details of our proposal in
that document. The proposed revisions involved a reorganization of the existing provisions, technical and editorial
changes, and the following substantive additions or revisions to the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Home Health Aide Duties and Supervision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;We proposed to define the duties of the home health aide as including, but not limited to, hands-on personal
care, simple procedures that are an extension of therapy or nursing services, assistance in ambulation or exercise,
and assistance in administering medications that are ordinarily self-administered. We also proposed that written
patient care instructions for the home health aide had to be prepared by the registered nurse or other appropriate
professional responsible for the supervision of the aide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We proposed to modify the requirements governing supervision of home health aide services to require the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ If the patient is receiving skilled care as well as aide services, the registered nurse or other appropriate professional
must make a supervisory visit to the patient's home at least once every 2 weeks. If the aide is an employee of the HHA or
hospice, at least one of these visits each month must be made while the aide is providing care to the patient. If the aide
is not an employee of the HHA or hospice, the HHA or hospice must perform all supervisory visits of that aide while the
aide is providing care to the patient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
+ If the patient is receiving home health aide services but is not receiving skilled care, the supervisory visit must
occur not less than once every 62 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We proposed to identify the responsibilities of an HHA or hospice that chooses to provide home health aide services
under arrangements with another organization as ensuring the overall quality of care provided by the aide, supervising
the aide, and ensuring the aide has met the training requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Conditions for Payment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, we proposed the following requirements for payment of home health services: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A requirement that the services must be furnished to an eligible beneficiary by, or under arrangements with,
an HHA that meets the HHA conditions of participation and has in effect a Medicare provider agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The physician certification and recertification requirements for home health services described in 42 CFR
424.22. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The coverage requirements discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Beneficiary Qualifications for Coverage of Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed that the beneficiary must be under the care of a physician who establishes the plan of care and that a doctor
of podiatric medicine may establish a plan of care under certain circumstances.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Requirements for the Plan of Care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We set forth the criteria that would have to be met in order for the plan of care to be considered acceptable. We addressed:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Those items that must be contained in the plan of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The specificity of the physician's orders for services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The timing of review of the plan of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The termination of the plan of care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Requirements for Qualifying Skilled Services To Be Covered and Billable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We described the overall nature of the services that must be furnished for the care to be considered skilled care and
the general concepts under which a decision regarding whether the services are reasonable and necessary should be
made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Dependent Services Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed that the services listed below would be covered only if the beneficiary had a need for at least one of the
qualifying skilled services. We also proposed requirements, based on the statute or long-standing policy, that
these services must meet in order to be covered by Medicare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Home health aide services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Medical social services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Occupational therapy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Durable medical equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Medical supplies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Services of interns and residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Allowable Administrative Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed that, in general, payment for certain services would be made as an administrative cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
H. Place of Service Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed, for purposes of Medicare coverage of home health services, that a beneficiary's home is any place in which
a beneficiary resides that does not meet the definition of a hospital, skilled nursing facility (SNF), or nursing
facility as defined in sections 1861(e)(1), 1819(a)(1), or 1919(a)(1) of the Act, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed that for services to be covered in an outpatient setting, they had to require equipment that could not be
made available in the beneficiary's home or were services that were furnished while the beneficiary was at the facility
to receive services requiring equipment that could not be made available in his or her home. We proposed that an outpatient
setting might include a hospital, SNF, rehabilitation center, or outpatient department affiliated with a medical
school, with which the HHA has an arrangement to provide services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Number of Visits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed that all Medicare home health services would be covered under Part A if the beneficiary had Part A entitlement
and, if the beneficiary had only Part B entitlement, under Part B. We proposed that, if all coverage requirements were
met, payment could be made for an unlimited number of covered visits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
J. Excluded Services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We specified that certain items would be excluded from coverage as Medicare home health services: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Drugs and biologicals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Services that would not be covered as inpatient hospital services. (Note: Although we discussed this proposed
provision in the preamble of the proposed rule, it was inadvertently omitted from the proposed regulation text).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Housekeeping services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Services covered as end stage renal disease services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Prosthetic devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Medical social services provided to family members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
K. Condition of Participation: Clinical Records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We proposed that the discharge summary, including the patient's medical and health status at discharge, must be sent
to the attending physician.

Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that Medicare should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide coverage of home health aide and other services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished by organizations other than Medicare-approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HHAs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are unable to accept this comment. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act at section 1861(m) defines home health services as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific items and services that are furnished by (or under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangements with) an HHA (as defined in section 1861(o) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act). Therefore, Medicare has no statutory authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cover any home health service that is not furnished by or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under arrangements with a Medicare-approved HHA.

 One commenter stated that the first sentence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of &sect;409.42(b), ``the beneficiary must be under the care of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician who establishes the plan of care'', should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changed to allow for a patient's treatment by a staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician.

 We do not believe that such a revision is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. The requirement that a patient be under the care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a physician who establishes the plan of care does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preclude the patient's treatment by other physicians in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to the one who establishes the plan of care.

 Several commenters stated that the need for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dietician services should be included in &sect;409.42(c) (which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lists the skilled services necessary to qualify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiary for home health services) and therefore added to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those needed skilled services that qualify a beneficiary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage of Medicare home health services. (Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters wanted this service added to &sect;409.44 as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered skilled service.)

 Sections 1814(a)(2)(C) and 1835(a)(2)(A) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act establish the eligibility criteria for Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage of home health services. Because these sections of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Act do not include the need for dietician services with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need for intermittent skilled nursing care, physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therapy, speech pathology services, and continuing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational therapy as necessary to establish eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Medicare coverage of home health services, we cannot

with ``speech-language pathology services'' and the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``speech therapist'' with ``speech-language pathologist''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
note that the term ``skilled therapist'' in this rule includes

speech-language pathologists.

 Section 409.43 establishes plan of care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements which must be met to obtain Medicare coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of home health services. Section 409.43 requires all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare covered home health services to be furnished under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician. Noncovered services, such as those that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related to the treatment of the patient's illness or injury,

are not subject to the coverage requirements of this

 One commenter requested clarification of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required content of the physician's orders. The commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was concerned that the intent of the section was to require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the physician's order to include a long, narrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
description of the services ordered. Another commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested clarification of the required specificity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician's orders for home health aide services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 409.43 does not require that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan of care include a narrative description of the services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ordered. As part of our ongoing efforts to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary paperwork, we have revised this section of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule to clarify that the plan of care need specify only the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical treatments to be furnished, the discipline that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnish them, and the frequency at which they will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished. Appropriate specificity of medical treatments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the physician's orders would include such orders as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``observe and evaluate surgical site'', ``perform sterile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dressing changes'', and, for home health aide services, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``assistance in personal care.'' As practice acts and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laws and regulations govern the actual methods by which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these services are performed, it is not necessary to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a description of how to furnish the service in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician's order. It is also important to note that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain additional plan of care requirements are contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Medicare HHA conditions of participation at 42 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although we believe that the therapist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should have input into the development of the physician's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
orders for therapy services, this would not be an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate revision to the coverage criteria contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section as monitoring and compliance efforts would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create an additional paperwork burden. This issue is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already adequately addressed in the Medicare HHA conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of participation at 42 CFR 484.18, which requires that ``the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therapist and other agency personnel participate in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing the plan of care.''

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that the physician 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be required to order a specific number of visits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before care is actually furnished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although the physician's order is generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to specify the number of visits ordered, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognize that this is not possible in all situations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this section allows the physician to order a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific range in the frequency of visits or visits ``as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed'' or ``PRN'' when necessary. We believe that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy provides the needed flexibility in those cases where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a physician cannot anticipate the specific number of visits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that will be necessary to meet a patient's needs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested that, when a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician orders a range of visits, the lower end of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
range should be used as the specific frequency when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree. If the lower end of a range of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visits was used as the specific frequency, any services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding the lower end, even though they may fall within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the range, would not be covered. We believe use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upper end of the range as the specific frequency affords an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HHA the needed flexibility to provide covered services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anywhere within the ordered range.

 One commenter stated that it was not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical to require a description of the patient's medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signs and symptoms that would occasion a visit as needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(``PRN'') as well as a specific limit on the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable PRN visits. Another commenter stated that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement did not provide HHAs with sufficient flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to respond to patient needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree with both comments. As we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated in the preamble of the proposed rule, we believe that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removing these requirements would allow unreasonable ``open- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ended'' orders for care. The intent of this requirement is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to allow physicians and HHAs the flexibility needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively serve patients whose need for care cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
easily predicted, not to give HHAs ``carte blanche'' to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide an unlimited number of visits with no restrictions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirement that a physician must describe the medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signs and symptoms that would occasion a visit ensures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the PRN visits are provided only in specific circumstances, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as a plugged urinary catheter or a leaking heparin lock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an IV antibiotic patient. The requirement that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician impose a specific limit on the number of PRN 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visits ensures that he or she will remain informed if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient's need for visits is greater than anticipated. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that, by establishing strict parameters in which PRN 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visits may be furnished, these requirements protect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient's health and safety while also guarding against 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare coverage of unreasonable visits.

Section 409.43(c) requires only that the

plan of care be signed by a physician who meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certification and recertification requirements of &sect;424.22, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
before the bill for services is submitted. This requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively precludes from signing the plan of care a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician who has a significant ownership interest in, or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant financial or contractual relationship with, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HHA. We do not believe that this requirement restricts the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

and dated by a registered nurse or qualified therapist but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need not actually be transcribed by them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree that it would be allowable for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated member of the HHA staff to receive oral orders 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over the phone as long as the orders are reviewed, signed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and dated with the date of receipt by a registered nurse or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualified therapist before the services are furnished. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have revised paragraph (d) to require that the ``orders must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be put in writing and be signed and dated with the date of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receipt by the registered nurse or qualified therapist (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in &sect;484.4 of this chapter) responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnishing or supervising the ordered services.'' This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision closely reflects the current policy governing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of oral orders in the hospital setting (see 42 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
482.23(c)(2)). It is also important to note that other

Federal or State laws or regulations may restrict the

personnel allowed to receive oral orders. To ensure

We have not revised this requirement. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a longstanding Medicare requirement that is intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure that the HHA obtains the physician's signature on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oral orders (which confirms that the services were furnished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a physician's order) in a timely manner. We believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the removal of this requirement would ensure that

of computer-generated alternative signatures. However, we

One commenter stated that the physician 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be required to review the plan of care at least 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every 62 days. The commenter believed that some patients' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need for care can be predicted for more than 62 days, and so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the physician's review should only be required when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have not accepted this comment. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that requiring the physician's review of the plan of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care at least once every 62 days protects patient health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety by ensuring a minimum level of physician oversight. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it is true that some patients' needs for services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

physician review of all patients' care and minimizes the

coordinate with similar physician review requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in &sect;&sect;424.22 and 484.18, thus allowing the HHA to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the plan of care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not be terminated just because a beneficiary does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive at least one covered skilled service in a 62 day 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained in this rule, a beneficiary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be in need of either intermittent skilled nursing care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuing occupational therapy to qualify for Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage of home health services. If the physician's plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of care does not order any of these services, we presume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the beneficiary no longer needs any of these skilled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services and therefore does not qualify for Medicare home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health coverage. However, we understand that some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individuals need skilled care at intervals of more than 62 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
days and so therefore allow coverage of services furnished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to beneficiaries who do not require at least one qualifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skilled service in a 62 day period if the physician 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents that such an interval without skilled care is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to the treatment of the beneficiary's illness or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
injury. We do not agree that the beneficiary should be able 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to continue to receive nonskilled services indefinitely when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is no documented need for a skilled service.

 One commenter stated that the proposed

current principles contained in the Medicare HHA Manual.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree. The requirements of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section are based on section 205.1(A) of the Medicare HHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Manual, which is entitled ``General Principles Governing

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters expressed concern about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare's policy that a service that can safely and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively be performed by the average nonmedical person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without the supervision of a licensed nurse cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered a skilled nursing service. The commenters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically disagreed with the preamble's example of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonskilled service that described a patient who could not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-administer eye drops that are normally self-administrable. The commenters believed that the absence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a caregiver to administer the eyedrops made the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administration of the eyedrops a skilled service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Our policy that a nonskilled service does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not become a skilled service simply because there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
competent person to perform it is intended to protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare from paying skilled personnel (at a skilled rate) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for furnishing nonskilled services. In the example 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described above, the absence of a caregiver to administer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the eyedrops does not make their administration a skilled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service. Therefore, this rule at &sect;409.44(b)(1)(iv) states 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that ``if the service could be performed by the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonmedical person, the absence of a competent person to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform it does not cause it to be a skilled nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service.'' This clear statement represents no change from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the longstanding Medicare policy that is currently contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the Medicare HHA Manual at &sect;205.1(A)(2) and (B)(4)(c).

 Several commenters requested clarification of

Medicare coverage of skilled nursing care following cataract 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Medicare coverage of skilled nursing care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished to beneficiaries who have recently undergone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cataract surgery is based on the same policies governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare home health coverage of skilled nursing care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished to any beneficiary. If, for example, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient's unique medical condition is such that the skills 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a nurse are required to observe and assess his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition or furnish additional teaching of a medication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regimen or safety precautions, these services would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered. It is important to note, however, that the routine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial teaching of post-cataract medication administration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and post-operative safety precautions that is needed by any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual having cataract surgery is routinely furnished by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ophthalmologists as part of their care of cataract patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it is not considered reasonable and necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a HHA to duplicate such services.

 One commenter requested that we remove the current requirement that psychiatric nursing services be furnished under
a plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a psychiatrist (see section 205.1(B)(15) of the Medicare
HHA Manual). The commenter believed that this requirement made it difficult for some beneficiaries who do not have
access to a psychiatrist to receive needed care from a psychiatrically trained nurse. The commenter also requested
that we include several examples of covered psychiatric nursing care.

 With regard to the requirement that a psychiatrist establish and review plans of care for psychiatric nursing services,
we agree with the commenter's concerns. We have not included a similar requirement in this rule and intend to revise
the requirements contained in the HHA Manual. We do not believe that this rule is the appropriate place to include specific
examples of skilled nursing care. However, we do intend to include several examples of covered psychiatric nursing
services in the revisions to the Medicare HHA Manual that will follow the publication of this rule.

 One commenter stated that the coverage requirements of proposed &sect;409.44(b)(2)(ii) (which describes the level
of complexity and sophistication of covered services) are too restrictive. The commenter believed that Medicare
should cover any services that ``fall within the scope of the licensed professional.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not agree with the commenter. We believe that such a vague and general policy would result in Medicare paying for
many services that do not necessarily require the skills of a licensed therapist to be performed safely and effectively.
For example, assisting a patient with simple transfers could be performed safely and effectively by a physical therapist,
but it should not be covered as a skilled therapy service because it could also be furnished safely and effectively
by a home health aide. We believe that the provisions of this paragraph ensure that Medicare will pay only for those
services which require the skills of a licensed therapist to be performed safely and effectively.

 One commenter stated that the requirement of &sect;409.44(c)(2)(iii) that ``there must be an expectation that the
beneficiary's condition will improve materially in a reasonable (and generally predictable) period of time *&blank;*&blank;*''
is too vague. The commenter specifically recommended that we delete the word ``materially'' from the paragraph.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have not accepted this comment. We consider ``material'' improvement to be improvement to a significant degree
or extent. This requirement ensures that Medicare will cover only those therapy services that are actually contributing
to the treatment of the patient's illness or injury. Such a requirement cannot be completely precise in its application
to all possible situations and its application does depend somewhat on the discretion of the intermediary. However,
we believe that the requirement of this paragraph is reasonable and understandable. We also point out that this is
a longstanding policy that is currently contained in the Medicare HHA Manual at section 205.2(A)(5).

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that paragraph (b) of proposed &sect;409.44 should be revised to recognize the medical necessity
of extended therapy in certain cases and of active therapy furnished to patients whose health is declining in certain
cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not believe that such a revision is necessary. Paragraph (c) (paragraph (b) in the proposed rule) states that
Medicare will pay for the services of a therapist when his or her skills are necessary for the safe and effective performance
of a maintenance program. This policy clearly recognizes that, in certain cases, an extended maintenance program
can be considered medically necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also believe that active therapy for a beneficiary whose health is declining can be covered. The new paragraph (a)
of this section that we have added in this final rule specifies that the intermediary's decision on whether care is
reasonable and necessary must be based on objective clinical evidence and the beneficiary's unique need for care.
Therefore, this rule specifically prohibits claims decisions based on general inferences about patients with similar
diagnoses, which means that it would be inappropriate for an intermediary to deny therapy services solely on the basis
that they were furnished over a long period of time or to a patient whose general health status is in decline.

 One commenter stated that we should require that the expectation that the beneficiary's condition will materially
improve be based on the therapist's assessment of the patient's rehabilitation potential and the physician's assessment
of the patient's unique medical condition. (We proposed only to require the physician's assessment.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe that such a revision would not be appropriate. Our policy concerning the physician's role in determining
the patient's need for care is based on section 1861(m) of the Act, which requires covered home health services to be
furnished under a plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a physician, and sections 1814(a)(2)(C)
and 1835(a)(2)(A), which require qualified Medicare home health beneficiaries to be under the care of a physician
and receiving services under a plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a physician. Because the law
specifically assigns these responsibilities to the physician, we do not believe that it would be appropriate to shift
the responsibility for assessment of the patient to an individual other than the physician. In addition, we believe
that the therapist's role in establishing the plan of care is adequately protected by the Medicare HHA conditions
of participation at 42 CFR 484.18(a), which specifically requires the consultation and participation of the therapist
(as well as other HHA staff) in the development of the plan of care.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Act at sections 1814(a)(2)(C) and 1835(a)(2)(A) specifically requires that a beneficiary be in need of physical
therapy, speech pathology services, continuing occupational therapy, or intermittent skilled nursing care to
be eligible for Medicare coverage of home health services. Because a patient who has received his or her last qualifying
service can no longer be considered in need of that service, Medicare cannot pay for any home health aide or medical
social services furnished that patient after the final qualifying visit. We have revised paragraph (a) of &sect;409.45
to clarify that dependent services furnished after the final qualifying service are not covered, except when the
dependent service was not followed by a qualifying service due to an unanticipated event such as the unexpected inpatient
admission or death of the beneficiary.

 One commenter stated that &sect;409.45 should be revised to include respite care for a beneficiary's caregiver as
a covered home health aide service.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have not accepted this comment. An individual who requires covered services_such as skilled nursing care_may
receive them when the need for the services arises because a caregiver who ordinarily provides them is temporarily
unavailable. In this context, the services are covered home health services even though one result may be respite
for the caregiver. On the other hand, the Act at section 1862(a)(1)(A) excludes any service that is not ``reasonable
and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body
member'' from Medicare coverage. ``Respite care'' that does not represent actual treatment of the beneficiary's
illness or injury, but primarily consists of noncovered care provided in order to relieve the beneficiary's caregiver,
would fall under the statutory exclusion. We have no statutory authority to cover respite care as a home health aide
service. To make this long-standing Medicare policy clear, &sect;409.45(b)(1) of this section specifically states
that a covered home health aide visit must be for the provision of hands-on personal care to the beneficiary or for services
that are needed to maintain the beneficiary's health or to facilitate treatment of the beneficiary's illness or injury.

 One commenter objected to &sect;409.45(b)(3)(iii), which requires that covered home health aide services ``be
of a type that there is no willing or able caregiver to provide, or, if there is a potential caregiver, the beneficiary
is unwilling to use the services of that individual.'' The commenter believes that this could lead to abuse of the Medicare
program by beneficiaries who seek to receive home health aide services by refusing to accept the services of an able

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have not revised this requirement. It has long been Medicare policy to cover services without regard to whether
there is someone in the home who could furnish them. This policy is described in section 203.2 of the HHA Manual, which
states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Where the Medicare criteria for coverage of home health services are met, beneficiaries are entitled by law to coverage
of reasonable and necessary home health services. Therefore, a beneficiary is entitled to have the costs of reasonable
and necessary services reimbursed by Medicare without regard to whether there is someone in the home available to
furnish them.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In those cases in which the beneficiary refuses to accept the services of an available caregiver, or when a caregiver
refuses to furnish needed care, it is not appropriate for Medicare to coerce those individuals into providing or receiving
the services under circumstances to which they object. Of course, if a caregiver is furnishing necessary services,
Medicare will not pay for a home health aide to furnish duplicative services. In addition, although we appreciate
the commenter's concern, we have no evidence of widespread abuse of this long-standing policy.

believes that physicians are not qualified to determine a patient's need for medical social services.

 Section 1861(m) of the Act requires that all covered home health services be furnished under a plan of care established
and periodically reviewed by a physician. In addition, this section of the Act specifically defines ``medical social
services under the direction of a physician'' as a covered home health service. Therefore, we cannot accept the commenter's
suggestion.

 One commenter requested that we clarify what constitutes a social or emotional problem that is an impediment to the
effective treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition or to his or her rate of recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A social or emotional problem that impedes (or is expected to impede) a beneficiary's medical treatment is a problem
which may obstruct or inhibit the effective treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition. Examples are an emotional
problem that causes the beneficiary to neglect his or her medication regimen and a social problem, such as a hostile
family situation or an extremely limited income, that results in the beneficiary receiving inadequate nutrition
or personal assistance. The Medicare HHA Manual at &sect;206.3 provides several examples of covered medical social
services provided to beneficiaries with such problems.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters stated that this section should be revised to allow Medicare coverage of medical social services
furnished to a beneficiary's family when such services are necessary to resolve an impediment to the beneficiary's
medical treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree with the commenters and have revised &sect;409.45(c)(2) accordingly to allow for Medicare coverage of medical
social services furnished on a short-term basis to a beneficiary's family member or caregiver when it can be demonstrated
that a brief intervention (that is, two or three visits) by the medical social worker is necessary to remove a clear
and direct impediment to the effective treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition or to his or her rate of recovery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that medical social services furnished to a beneficiary's family member or caregiver in these circumstances
will enhance the effectiveness of the treatment of the beneficiary's illness or injury. In those cases where a family
member or caregiver is directly impeding the beneficiary's medical treatment or rate of recovery (for example, by
failing to provide necessary care or by engaging in abusive neglectful behavior), we believe that short-term medical
social services furnished to the caregiver or family member for the purpose of removing that impediment will greatly
benefit the home health patient by enhancing the effectiveness of his or her medical treatment and, ultimately, the
rate and level of his or her recovery. We also expect that, in these circumstances, the effective use of short-term
medical social services will result in a reduction in the beneficiary's need for other home health services (such
as skilled nursing care to observe and assess the patient's treatment and progress). In some cases, these services
may also prevent a costly inpatient stay by the beneficiary necessitated by his or her unhealthy or unsafe home environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We also note that Medicare currently covers family counseling services furnished by a physician to a beneficiary's
family when the primary purpose is the treatment of the beneficiary's condition and not the treatment of the family
member's problems (see &sect;35&hyph;14 of the Medicare Coverage Issues Manual). We believe that the services of
a medical social worker furnished to a beneficiary's family member under similar circumstances would also be of value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this coverage is consistent with our long-standing policy regarding the coverage of home health skilled
nursing visits for purposes of teaching and training family members or caregivers. Medicare has long covered a limited
number of skilled nursing visits for teaching and training family members where the teaching and training is appropriate
to prepare the family member to furnish treatment or support for the beneficiary's functional loss, illness or injury.
Again, as with the physician counseling, Medicare covers these visits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to emphasize that this revision is intended to cover medical social services furnished to a family
member or caregiver only when a brief intervention will resolve a problem which clearly and directly impedes the beneficiary's
medical treatment. To be considered ``clear and direct'' the behavior or actions of the family member or caregiver
must plainly obstruct, contravene, or prevent the patient's medical treatment or rate of recovery. The HHA is responsible
for demonstrating in its documentation that the problem is a clear and direct impediment to the treatment of the beneficiary's
medical condition or rate of recovery. Medical social services furnished to address general problems that do not
clearly and directly impede the beneficiary's treatment or rate of recovery as well as long-term social services
furnished to family members, such as ongoing alcohol counseling, are not covered. Because we have limited coverage
to medical social services to address only clear and direct impediments on a short-term basis, it is our expectation
that medical social services furnished to family members or caregivers should require only a brief intervention
on the part of the social worker, which should rarely exceed two or three visits. We intend to include an example of covered
medical social services furnished to a family member in the Medicare HHA Manual. We have also revised in this final
rule the paragraph (g) that we had proposed to add to &sect;409.49. That paragraph will now exclude from Medicare coverage
medical social services furnished to family members, except as provided in &sect;409.45(c)(2).

 One commenter objected to this section's requirement that covered medical social services must be necessary to resolve
social or emotional problems that are expected to be an impediment to the treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition
or to his or her rate of recovery. The commenter stated that the services of a social worker may address a wide range of
difficulties in addition to those that present an impediment to the treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition.

 The Act at section 1861(m) specifically defines

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
medical
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 social services as a covered home health service. In addition, section 1862(a)(1)(A) of the Act excludes from Medicare
coverage any service that is not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient's illness
or injury. Therefore, Medicare is limited to covering those social services that are provided to treat the patient's

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
medical 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
condition; that is, they are directed at resolving impediments to the treatment of the patient's illness or injury.
Although we agree that professional social workers are qualified to address a wide range of problems beyond those
that may affect the treatment of the patient's medical condition, we do not agree that Medicare should cover such services.

 We do not believe that this requirement is unreasonable. It would not be proper for Medicare to pay a social worker to
perform services that do not require his or her unique skills. It is important to note that this is a longstanding coverage
requirement that also applies to skilled nursing and therapy services (see &sect;&sect;409.44(b)(1)(ii) and (c)(2)(ii)).
This longstanding requirement is intended to protect Medicare from making payment to a skilled professional for
services that could have been furnished by the average nonmedical person.

 The manual section to which the commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refers describes Medicare Part B coverage of durable medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment (DME) and related supplies. We do not believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the suggested revision is necessary because paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) of this section specifically provides for Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage of DME under the home health benefit identical to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its coverage under Part B. Therefore, all policy relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Part B coverage of DME applies to home health DME 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage, not just the policy contained in section 3113.4 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Intermediary Manual. We have chosen not to include the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive manual provisions on Part B DME coverage in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, but we have cross-referenced paragraph (e) with 42 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
410.38, which contains the regulations describing the scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and conditions of payment for DME under Part B. We have not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included the manual provisions in this rule because we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that &sect;410.38 (to which this section refers) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides an adequate description of Medicare DME coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and because the extensive and detailed nature of the manual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions on DME coverage make them best suited for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion in the appropriate manuals but inappropriate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclusion in this rule. We also note that &sect;220 of the

list of Medicare-covered medical supplies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not issue a list of covered medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplies because it is not feasible to compile and maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such a list in a timely and comprehensive manner. Also, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some cases, Medicare coverage of a certain item may depend 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the circumstances in which it is used (such as skin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lotion or shampoo), and so a list would not adequately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide for all possible coverage. Therefore, we define (in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both this rule and in the Medicare HHA Manual) the criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Medicare coverage of medical supplies and rely on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 In addition to establishing other

home health services as items and services furnished under a

plan of care established and periodically reviewed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician. Therefore, there is no statutory authority for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare coverage of services that have not been ordered by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a physician. If the nurse performing the evaluation visit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finds the beneficiary to be in need of immediate care, he or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she may obtain verbal orders for care from a physician at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that time and then proceed to furnish the ordered care. In

this circumstance, the initial evaluation visit would then

 One commenter stated that visits by

registered nurses or other qualified professionals for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision of home health aides should be considered a home

health aide cost rather than an allowable administrative

cost.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the cost of the supervisory visit is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with providing an administrative service (that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is, compliance with the requirements of the Medicare HHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions of participation at 42 CFR 484.36) and not a home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health aide service, the costs associated with the provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the required supervisory visits is an allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administrative cost. We have also added a new &sect;413.125 in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule to refer to the rules on the allowability of

 We have not accepted this comment for two

reasons. First, the purpose of this section is to describe

certain services that are allowable administrative costs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to establish requirements for coverage of skilled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nursing or physical therapy services; therefore, such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision would not be appropriate to this section. Second, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we do not believe that such a revision is necessary because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State practice acts and professional standards of practice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally regulate the services that can be provided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nurses and therapists, thus preventing nurses or therapists

from furnishing services they are not qualified to provide.

 We have accepted this comment. We have

revised this section to reflect the specific provisions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1861(m)(7) of the Act and previous regulations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;409.42(e) more closely. As stated in the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;409.47(b), an outpatient setting may include a hospital, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SNF or a rehabilitation center with which the HHA has an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
arrangement in accordance with &sect;484.14(h) of this chapter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that this revised requirement, by duplicating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of section 1861(m) of the Act, more closely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects the original congressional intent to restrict home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health coverage of outpatient services to only a few 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific outpatient facilities and thus ensure that home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health services would be primarily provided in the homes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the beneficiaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has also been brought to our attention that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition of a beneficiary's home at proposed &sect;409.47(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the definition of ``confined to the home'' at proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;409.42(a) were not entirely consistent. We have revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;409.42(a) so that both sections define a beneficiary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home for purposes of Medicare home health coverage as any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
place in which the beneficiary resides that is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital, SNF, or nursing facility as defined in sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1861(e)(1), 1819(a)(1), or 1919(a)(1) of the Act,

the Act specifically allows Medicare coverage of outpatient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home health services furnished in a hospital, SNF, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rehabilitation center. We have revised paragraph (b) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflect the statutory provision. We have not expanded the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list of allowable outpatient settings because such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revision would not be consistent with the plain language of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statute. Also, it is important to note that section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1861(m)(7)(A) of the Act provides for coverage of outpatient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home health services only when the beneficiary requires a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service which ``involves the use of equipment of such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nature that the items and services cannot readily be made 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the individual'' in his or her home. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means that Medicare coverage of outpatient home health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services is available only when the primary service cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be furnished in the home, not merely when it is more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convenient to the HHA or beneficiary to provide the service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an outpatient setting. Because coverage of outpatient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home health services is available only in such specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances, we believe that the statutory limitation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the services to certain specific facilities is appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and does not restrict a beneficiary's access to covered home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health outpatient care.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter requested clarification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare coverage when a nurse provides a skilled nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service and a home health aide service in the course of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single visit. The commenter suggested that the HHA should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive two payments for this visit: one payment for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skilled nursing visit and one for a home health aide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a nurse furnishes several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services that fall within the normal scope of a nurse's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice in the course of a single visit, that constitutes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only one visit. Because the visit involved only a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nurse providing home health services during the course of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single visit, the fact that the nurse also provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidental unskilled services (which can be safely and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectively provided by a licensed nurse) in addition to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skilled nursing care does not mean that the service could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered as two visits. We consider this situation to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve only a single episode of personal contact between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HHA staff and the beneficiary and, therefore, covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only as a single visit under the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;409.48(c).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter requested clarification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare coverage when two individuals are needed to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a service. The commenter specifically cited a situation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which a nurse and a home health aide are required to furnish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in &sect;409.48(c)(3) of this section, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare will pay for two visits when two individuals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed to furnish a service (e.g., a bath, wound care, or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain exercise). Because each patient's situation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unique, we have not established a specific guideline for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which combinations of HHA personnel can furnish services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are covered as two visits. The personnel, however, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be appropriate for the service to be performed (for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, it would not require the services of two licensed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nurses to give a routine bath to a heavy beneficiary). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although coverage of these services does not require the HHA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to submit any additional documentation, the clinical notes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should describe why it is necessary for two individuals to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnish the service (patient's weight, nature of required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter opposed the coverage of two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visits when the HHA staff cannot provide the reasonable and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary care in the course of a single visit but remain in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the beneficiary's home between the provision of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services. The commenter stated that claims for coverage in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this situation would be too difficult for the intermediary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to review. Another commenter requested that we rescind this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage until its impact can be studied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have not accepted either of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments. We believe that, in those situations in which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HHA cannot provide the necessary services in the course of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
single visit (e.g., wound dressing changes), it is fair and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable to cover two separate visits even though the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual furnishing the care has remained in the home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between visits (e.g., to provide companionship or other non-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered care). Abandonment of this policy would simply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in HHA staff leaving the home for a token period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time or having a different HHA staff member provide the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second service to create an artificial ``second visit.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although coverage of these visits may be more demanding for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the intermediary to review, the removal of this coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would inevitably result in HHAs allocating staff less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiently to secure coverage of two visits. In summary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if the two services cannot feasibly be provided in a single 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visit, we do not believe what the provider does between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those services is relevant to the coverage decision. With 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regard to delaying implementation of this coverage, Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has covered two visits in this situation for some time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without discernible effect. This rule codifies current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that the Medicare home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health benefit should cover drugs and biologicals furnished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the home. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We cannot accept this comment because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1861(m)(5) of the Act specifically excludes drugs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and biologicals from Medicare home health coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter noted that the regulations text 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the proposed rule omitted paragraph (c) of &sect;409.49. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed rule did inadvertently omit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c) of this section from the regulations text, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
although the provisions of paragraph (c) were described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preamble. This final rule includes paragraph (c), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excludes from home health coverage services which would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be covered if furnished as hospital inpatient services. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have specified this exclusion because the unnumbered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material in section 1861(m) of the Act following paragraph 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m)(7) specifically precludes home health coverage of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service that would not be covered as an inpatient hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that exclusion from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage of housekeeping services is too restrictive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not agree. It is important to note 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that &sect;409.49(d) excludes only those services whose sole 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purpose is to allow the beneficiary to continue to reside in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
his or her home. If a home health aide performs some light 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
housekeeping incidental to providing a covered home health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aide service, that visit would not be excluded from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage. However, a visit for the sole purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing housekeeping services would not be covered, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these services are not related to the treatment of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiary's illness or injury. As we stated in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble of the proposed rule, this does not represent any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change from current Medicare policy and would not affect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage of home health aide services that are essential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
healthcare, such as bathroom disinfection and the cleaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of soiled sheets. Also, it is important to note that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion applies to Medicare coverage of aide services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the home health benefit and has no impact on coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ``homemaker'' services furnished under the Medicare hospice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefit. ``Homemaker'' services, which we consider to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identical to housekeeping services, are specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mentioned as a covered hospice service in 42 CFR 418.202(g).

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters asked that we clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare coverage of home health services furnished to end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically requested clarification of Medicare coverage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a home health nursing visit to furnish wound care related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an abandoned shunt site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because Medicare's composite rate payment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an ESRD facility is intended to subsume payment for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dialysis-related services, any service directly related to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiary's dialysis is covered as a dialysis service and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not as a home health service. Home health services that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not related to an ESRD beneficiary's dialysis, however, can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be covered under the home health benefit if all requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are met (for example, the beneficiary is homebound). Only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those services which are directly related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiary's dialysis (and not to other aspects of renal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disease) are excluded by this paragraph. Because wound care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an abandoned shunt site is not directly related to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficiary's dialysis, a nursing visit to furnish such care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a qualified Medicare home health beneficiary would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that the reference to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;410.36 in paragraph (f) appears to exclude coverage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wound supplies and intravenous maintenance supplies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Paragraph (f) excludes from coverage only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those items which meet the requirements of &sect;410.36(b) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prosthetic devices. That is, prosthetic devices that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replace all or part of a body organ (with the exception of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
catheters, catheter supplies, ostomy bags, and bags relating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ostomy care) are excluded from coverage under the home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health benefit. Section 1861(m) of the Act indicates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical supplies and durable medical equipment are covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home health services. Since prosthetic devices are not also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed in section 1861(m), they cannot be covered as home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health services. Items described in &sect;410.36(a), such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surgical dressings, are not excluded by this paragraph. Any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
item that meets the requirements for coverage contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;409.45(f) of this rule as medical supplies may be covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a home health service.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters stated that the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that home health aides must receive at least 12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours of in-service training each calendar year is overly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdensome. The commenters did not protest the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of training hours but found the requirement that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training be furnished within each calendar year to present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdensome scheduling problems. The commenters said these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduling problems were particularly difficult in the cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of home health aides who were hired late in the calendar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year and therefore were obligated to complete the 12 hours 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of training in a relatively short period of time.

 We agree with the commenters that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement would be overly burdensome and have revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed &sect;484.36(b)(2)(iii) to require each aide to receive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least 12 hours of in-service training per 12 month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period. Without the requirement that the training be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received in each calendar year, this provision will allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HHAs a full 12 months to provide the required in-service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training to newly hired home health aides. The revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement will also allow HHAs greater flexibility in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that the provision of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;484.36(c) requiring the registered nurse to assign the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home health aide to a specific patient reduces the HHA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduling flexibility and ability to send a substitute aide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the event of sickness or other unforeseen circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This requirement represents no change from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current requirements of this section. Although we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
understand that this requirement may slightly reduce the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HHA's scheduling flexibility, we believe that the benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be gained by its encouragement of consistency in care and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
familiarity between patient and home health aide far 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outweighs any reduction in scheduling flexibility. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement does not prevent the assignment of more than one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aide to a patient, and we certainly do not intend it to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preclude the use of a substitute aide when illness or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unforseen circumstances prevents the regularly scheduled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aide from providing services.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that a licensed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical nurse (LPN) should be allowed to perform the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required home health aide supervisory visit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not agree. We believe that the more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive educational background of a registered nurse (RN) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
makes the RN better equipped to assess the care provided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the home health aide as well as the total effect of the care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the patient's condition. Therefore, we believe that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is in the best interest of the patient's health and safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to require that supervisory visits be performed by an RN. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has long been Medicare policy that the RN's extensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional training uniquely qualifies him or her to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
perform evaluation and supervisory functions. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognition of the RN's qualifications is represented not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only in this section but in &sect;484.30, which describes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skilled nursing services, &sect;484.16, which describes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
group of professional personnel, and &sect;484.14(d), which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires therapeutic services to be furnished under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervision of a physician or RN.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter opposed the requirement that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervisory visit be performed no less frequently than every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two weeks as costly to the HHA and unnecessary because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patients are regularly seen by a nurse or therapist who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely performs a basic assessment of the care furnished by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the home health aide anyway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree with the commenter. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient is receiving skilled care from a registered nurse or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therapist on a biweekly basis, then the professional can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
easily perform the required supervisory visit during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course of his or her visit to furnish covered skilled care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we believe that patients in the situation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described by the commenter present little cost or difficulty 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to an HHA scheduling supervisory visits. Not all patients, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, receive skilled nursing or therapy services on such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a regular basis. When a patient is receiving skilled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nursing or therapy services, we believe that it is in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
best interest of the patient to require the registered nurse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or appropriate therapist to supervise and assess the care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnished by the home health aide on a biweekly basis. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervisory visit ensures that the aide services will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regularly assessed to ensure that they are furnished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly and of benefit to the treatment of the patient's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illness or injury.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Many commenters oppose the proposed provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;484.36(d)(2)(i), which would have required at least one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervisory visit per month to occur while the aide is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
furnishing services if the patient is receiving one or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skilled services. Many commenters also oppose the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision in paragraph (d)(2)(ii), which would have required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all supervisory visits to occur while the aide is furnishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services when the aide is not employed directly by the HHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have accepted these comments and are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including these proposed supervisory requirements contained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in &sect;484.36(d)(2)(i) and (ii) in the final rule. We have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concluded that the improvement in the quality of home health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aide services that has occurred as a result of the home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health aide training and competency evaluation requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented in 1990, as well as the increase in patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation in care that has resulted from the recently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented patient rights requirements of &sect;484.10, make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed requirements for direct aide supervision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary. These requirements were proposed in response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a study published by the Office of the Inspector General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in September 1987. (``Home Health Aide Services for Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Patients'', OA1&hyph;02&hyph;86&hyph;00010, September 1987.) Since the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this study was completed, however, we have instituted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training and evaluation requirements referred to above as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as annual in-service training and performance review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. We believe that these requirements have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly improved the quality and oversight of home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health aide services. In addition, the institution of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient rights requirements has given home health patients a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more comprehensive knowledge of their rights regarding care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning and provision. This, in effect, lets the patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
play a greater role in the oversight of the care he or she 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receives.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters stated that arranging for the provision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed supervisory requirements would impose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant burdens and costs associated with scheduling, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
travel, and the inefficient allocation of nursing resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters also stated that the joint visits would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of limited value because many patients are reluctant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
voice concerns or complaints in the presence of the home 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health aide (preferring to speak with the nurse privately in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person or by telephone). These legitimate and practical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns have persuaded us that the value to be gained by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed requirements does not merit the burden which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they would impose on HHAs. Because of the progress we have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already made in our efforts to ensure the high quality of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
home health aide services furnished by Medicare-approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HHAs, we do not believe that the advantages of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements justify their associated cost and burden. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, this final rule does not contain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters stated that the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supervisory visit by a registered nurse every 62 days when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the non-Medicare patient is receiving home health aide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services but no skilled nursing care or physical, speech, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupational therapy is too infrequent. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that the required frequency of supervisory visits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not provide adequate oversight of home health aide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We disagree. We believe that these non-Medicare patients who are not receiving skilled nursing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
care, physical or occupational therapy, or speech-language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathology services are not as ill as those who are receiving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
skilled services and therefore are at less risk of medical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems or complications that could occur during the course 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of receiving home health aide services. Because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patients are less ill, and therefore receiving home health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aide care that is likely to be more custodial in nature, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believe that it is appropriate to require a lower frequency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of supervision. Due to the lower frequency of these visits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we have specifically required them to occur while the aide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is furnishing services so that the nurse can assess the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aide's actual provision of care as well as the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of the patient. Also, we are requiring the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on-site supervisory visit (which applies only to non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare patients) at this frequency to conform Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that apply to HHAs that participate in Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the licensure requirements of many States, thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enabling many HHAs to meet the administrative requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of two bodies with a single visit.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters expressed concern that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed requirement that discharge summaries be sent to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attending physician will increase the flow of unwanted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paperwork into physicians' offices. One commenter suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that we require HHAs to inform the attending physician of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the availability of the discharge summary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We understand the commenters' concern and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have accepted the suggestion. We have revised &sect;484.48 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require the HHA to inform the attending physician of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of a discharge summary and send it to him or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
her upon request. This requirement will allow physicians to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain informed of the care furnished to their patients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while minimizing the amount of unwanted paperwork being sent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to physicians' offices. We would also like to clarify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the discharge summary need not be a separate piece of paper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and could be incorporated into the routine summary reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already furnished to the physician.

 One commenter stated that the discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
summary requirement could not be implemented without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not agree with the commenter. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that HHAs maintain a discharge summary for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient is not new. Section 484.48 has long required the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HHA to include a discharge summary in the patient's clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record. This rule does not impose any additional paperwork 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. It only requires the HHA to make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge summary (already required under the existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions of participation) available to the patient's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attending physician upon request. Also, as stated above, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are not requiring that the discharge summary be a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
piece of paper that is not part of the routine summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports already being submitted to the physician.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter expressed concern that this section would increase a hospice's operating costs because the commenter
believed it would require that homemaker services be furnished by home health aides. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The commenter misinterpreted the requirements of the paragraph. Although a home health aide can furnish homemaker
services, Medicare does not require homemaker services furnished under the Medicare hospice benefit to be provided
by home health aides. This section specifically distinguishes between home health aide services, which must be provided
by an individual who meets the home health aide training and competency evaluation requirements of &sect;484.36,
and homemaker services, which can be provided by individuals who are not required to have completed any specific training
or competency evaluation.

Changes From the Proposed Rule Made by This Final Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following is a summary listing of provisions in this final rule that differ from those in the proposed rule. Additional
minor clarifying or editorial changes have also been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised proposed &sect;409.43(b) to clarify the required content of physician orders. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised proposed &sect;409.43(c) to correct a printing error in the physician signature requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised proposed &sect;409.43(d) to require the registered nurse or therapist who is responsible
for furnishing or supervising the ordered services to sign verbal orders received by the HHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised proposed &sect;409.44 to include general requirements for coverage determinations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised proposed &sect;409.42, &sect;409.44, and &sect;409.45 to replace the term ``speech therapist''
with ``speech-language pathologist'' and the term ``speech therapy'' with ``speech-language pathology services.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised proposed &sect;409.45(a) to clarify that no dependent services may be covered after the final
qualifying service has been furnished. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised proposed &sect;409.45(c)(2) to allow the provision of medical social services on a short-term
basis to a beneficiary's family member or caregiver. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised proposed &sect;409.45(g)(1) to replace ``Council on Medical Education of the American Medical
Association'' with ``Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised proposed &sect;409.47(b) to include the allowable home health outpatient settings specified
in the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have added &sect;409.49(c), which excludes Medicare home health coverage of services that would not be
covered as inpatient services. This was inadvertently omitted from the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised proposed &sect;409.49(g) to exclude Medicare home health coverage of medical social services
provided to family members except as provided in &sect;409.45(c)(2). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised &sect;484.36(b)(2)(iii) to require a home health aide to receive at least 12 hours of in-service
training during each 12-month period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We are not including the proposed home health aide supervision requirements that had been located in proposed
&sect;&sect;484.36(d)(2) (i) and (ii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have revised the introductory paragraph of proposed &sect;484.48 to require the HHA to inform the attending
physician of the availability of the discharge summary and to send it to him or her upon request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;We have added a new &sect;413.125 to refer to the rules on allowability of certain costs in &sect;&sect;409.49(b)
and 409.46. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a rule will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all HHAs are considered to be small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a
significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform
to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital
as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions in this final rule clarify existing policy and represent minor changes to the proposed rule published
September 27, 1991 (56 FR 49154). We have revised &sect;409.45(a) to clarify that we do not cover dependent services
after the final qualifying service has been furnished except under certain circumstances. Though we are not able
to estimate the magnitude, we believe this change will result in Medicare program savings.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have revised &sect;409.45(c)(2) to allow provision of medical social services on a short-term basis to a beneficiary's
family member or caregiver if it can be demonstrated that the service is necessary to resolve a clear and direct impediment
to the treatment of the beneficiary's medical condition or to his or her rate of recovery. Though this change could
increase program expenditures, we believe the additional cost will be negligible because of the low volume of these
services and offsetting savings if the beneficiary's rate of recovery is improved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several changes made to the proposed rule will benefit HHAs' administration and utilization of home health aides.
We have revised &sect;484.36(b)(2)(iii) to allow a home health aide to receive the required 12 hours of in-service
training during a 12-month period instead of each calendar year. This change allows HHAs some flexibility in scheduling
training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters opposed the requirements of proposed &sect;484.36(d)(2)(i) and (ii). We agreed and are deleting
those sections from the final rule. Therefore, we are not mandating supervisory visits once a month while the home
health aide is providing patient care, or mandating supervisory visits while the aide is furnishing services in all
instances if the home health aide services are provided by an individual not employed directly by the HHA. These changes
allow HHAs additional flexibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined,
and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities and will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural
hospitals.

Collection of Information Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 409.43, 484.18, 484.36, and 484.48 of this document contain information collection requirements. As required
by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504), we have submitted a copy of this document
to OMB for its review of these information collection requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, these information collection requirements have been previously approved under the information collection
requirements contained in the conditions of participation for home health agencies. These information collection
requirements implement patient rights provisions and set forth home health aide criteria; they were approved under
the OMB approval number 0938&hyph;0365 on June 24, 1991 through December 31, 1993 by OMB in accordance with the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). We are requesting reapproval of the collection requirements in those sections.
Public reporting burden for these collections of information is estimated to be six hours per home health agency per
year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection and recordkeeping requirements
should direct them to the OMB official whose name appears in the ``ADDRESSES'' section of this preamble.

(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Physician's orders.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The physician's orders for services in the plan of care must specify the medical treatments to be furnished as well
as the type of home health discipline that will furnish the ordered services and at what frequency the services will
be furnished. Orders for services to be provided ``as needed'' or ``PRN'' must be accompanied by a description of the
beneficiary's medical signs and symptoms that would occasion the visit and a specific limit on the number of those
visits to be made under the order before an additional physician order would have to be obtained. Orders for care may
indicate a specific range in frequency of visits to ensure that the most appropriate level of services is furnished.
If a range of visits is ordered, the upper limit of the range is considered the specific frequency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If any services are provided based on a physician's oral orders, the orders must be put in writing and be signed and dated
with the date of receipt by the registered nurse or qualified therapist (as defined in &sect;484.4 of this chapter)
responsible for furnishing or supervising the ordered services. Oral orders may only be accepted by personnel authorized
to do so by applicable State and Federal laws and regulations as well as by the HHA's internal policies. The oral orders
must also be countersigned and dated by the physician before the HHA bills for the care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Frequency of review.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The plan of care must be reviewed by the physician (as specified in &sect;409.42(b)) in consultation with agency professional
personnel at least every 62 days. Each review of a beneficiary's plan of care must contain the signature of the physician

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Termination of the plan of care.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The plan of care is considered to be terminated if the beneficiary does not receive at least one covered skilled nursing,
physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, or occupational therapy visit in a 62-day period unless
the physician documents that the interval without such care is appropriate to the treatment of the beneficiary's
illness or injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Section 409.44 is revised to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 -->
&sect;409.44 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->
Skilled services requirements.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The intermediary's decision on whether care is reasonable and necessary is based on information provided on the forms
and in the medical record concerning the unique medical condition of the individual beneficiary. A coverage denial
is not made solely on the basis of the reviewer's general inferences about patients with similar diagnoses or on data
related to utilization generally but is based upon objective clinical evidence regarding the beneficiary's individual
need for care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Skilled nursing care.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1) Skilled nursing care consists of those services that must, under State law, be performed by a registered nurse,
or practical (vocational) nurse, as defined in &sect;484.4 of this chapter, and meet the criteria for skilled nursing
services specified in &sect;409.32. See &sect;409.33 (a) and (b) for a description of skilled nursing services and
examples of them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) In determining whether a service requires the skill of a licensed nurse, consideration must be given to the inherent
complexity of the service, the condition of the beneficiary, and accepted standards of medical and nursing practice.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the nature of a service is such that it can safely and effectively be performed by the average nonmedical person
without direct supervision of a licensed nurse, the service cannot be regarded as a skilled nursing service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The fact that a skilled nursing service can be or is taught to the beneficiary or to the beneficiary's family or
friends does not negate the skilled aspect of the service when performed by the nurse.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(iv) If the service could be performed by the average nonmedical person, the absence of a competent person to perform
it does not cause it to be a skilled nursing service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The skilled nursing care must be provided on a part-time or intermittent basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The skilled nursing services must be reasonable and necessary for the treatment of the illness or injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) To be considered reasonable and necessary, the services must be consistent with the nature and severity of the
beneficiary's illness or injury, his or her particular medical needs, and accepted standards of medical and nursing
practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The skilled nursing care provided to the beneficiary must be reasonable within the context of the beneficiary's
condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The determination of whether skilled nursing care is reasonable and necessary must be based solely upon the
beneficiary's unique condition and individual needs, without regard to whether the illness or injury is acute, chronic,
terminal, or expected to last a long time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, and occupational therapy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be covered, physical therapy, speech-language pathology services, and occupational therapy must satisfy the
criteria in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. Occupational therapy services initially qualify for
home health coverage only if they are part of a plan of care that also includes intermittent skilled nursing care, physical
therapy, or speech-language pathology services as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Speech-language pathology services and physical or occupational therapy services must relate directly and
specifically to a treatment regimen (established by the physician, after any needed consultation with the qualified
therapist) that is designed to treat the beneficiary's illness or injury. Services related to activities for the
general physical welfare of beneficiaries (for example, exercises to promote overall fitness) do not constitute
physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech-language pathology services for Medicare purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Physical and occupational therapy and speech-language pathology services must be reasonable and necessary.
To be considered reasonable and necessary, the following conditions must be met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The services must be considered under accepted standards of medical practice to be a specific, safe, and effective
treatment for the beneficiary's condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The services must be of such a level of complexity and sophistication or the condition of the beneficiary must
be such that the services required can safely and effectively be performed only by a qualified physical therapist
or by a qualified physical therapy assistant under the supervision of a qualified physical therapist, by a qualified
speech-language pathologist, or by a qualified occupational therapist or a qualified occupational therapy assistant
under the supervision of a qualified occupational therapist (as defined in &sect;484.4 of this chapter). Services
that do not require the performance or supervision of a physical therapist or an occupational therapist are not considered
reasonable or necessary physical therapy or occupational therapy services, even if they are performed by or supervised
by a physical therapist or occupational therapist. Services that do not require the skills of a speech-language pathologist
are not considered to be reasonable and necessary speech-language pathology services even if they are performed
by or supervised by a speech-language pathologist . 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) There must be an expectation that the beneficiary's condition will improve materially in a reasonable (and
generally predictable) period of time based on the physician's assessment of the beneficiary's restoration potential
and unique medical condition, or the services must be necessary to establish a safe and effective maintenance program
required in connection with a specific disease, or the skills of a therapist must be necessary to perform a safe and
effective maintenance program. If the services are for the establishment of a maintenance program, they may include
the design of the program, the instruction of the beneficiary, family, or home health aides, and the necessary infrequent
reevaluations of the beneficiary and the program to the degree that the specialized knowledge and judgment of a physical
therapist, speech-language pathologist, or occupational therapist is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The amount, frequency, and duration of the services must be reasonable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. A new &sect;409.45 is added to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Services discussed in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section may be covered only if the beneficiary needs skilled
nursing care on an intermittent basis, as described in &sect;409.44(a); physical therapy or speech-language pathology
services as described in &sect;409.44(b); or has a continuing need for occupational therapy services as described
in &sect;409.44(c) if the beneficiary's eligibility for home health services has been established by virtue of a
prior need for intermittent skilled nursing care, speech-language pathology services, or physical therapy in the
current or prior certification period; and otherwise meets the qualifying criteria (confined to the home, under
the care of a physician, in need of skilled services, and under a plan of care) specified in &sect;409.42. Home health
coverage is not available for services furnished to a beneficiary who is no longer in need of one of the qualifying skilled
services specified in this paragraph. Therefore, dependent services furnished after the final qualifying skilled
service are not covered, except when the dependent service was not followed by a qualifying skilled service as a result
of the unexpected inpatient admission or death of the beneficiary, or due to some other unanticipated event. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Home health aide services. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To be covered, home health aide services must meet each of the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

costs. If a physician specifically orders that a particular skilled service be furnished during the evaluation in
which the agency accepts the beneficiary for treatment and all other coverage criteria are met, the visit is billable

covered home health services. In those circumstances in which all reasonable and necessary home health services
cannot be provided in the course of a single visit, HHA staff or others providing services under arrangements with
the HHA may remain at the beneficiary's residence between visits (for example, to provide non-covered services).

Assignment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The home health aide is assigned to a specific patient by the registered nurse. Written patient care instructions
for the home health aide must be prepared by the registered nurse or other appropriate professional who is responsible
for the supervision of the home health aide under paragraph (d) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Duties.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The home health aide provides services that are ordered by the physician in the plan of care and that the aide is permitted
to perform under State law. The duties of a home health aide include the provision of hands-on personal care, performance
of simple procedures as an extension of therapy or nursing services, assistance in ambulation or exercises, and assistance
in administering medications that are ordinarily self-administered. Any home health aide services offered by an
HHA must be provided by a qualified home health aide. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard: Supervision. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the patient receives skilled nursing care, the registered nurse must perform the supervisory visit required
by paragraph (d)(2) of this section. If the patient is not receiving skilled nursing care, but is receiving another
skilled service (that is, physical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech-language pathology services), supervision
may be provided by the appropriate therapist. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The registered nurse (or another professional described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) must make an on-site
visit to the patient's home no less frequently than every 2 weeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If home health aide services are provided to a patient who is not receiving skilled nursing care, physical or occupational
therapy or speech-language pathology services, the registered nurse must make a supervisory visit to the patient's
home no less frequently than every 62 days. In these cases, to ensure that the aide is properly caring for the patient,
each supervisory visit must occur while the home health aide is providing patient care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If home health aide services are provided by an individual who is not employed directly by the HHA (or hospice),
the services of the home health aide must be provided under arrangements, as defined in section 1861(w)(1) of the Act.
If the HHA (or hospice) chooses to provide home health aide services under arrangements with another organization,
the HHA's (or hospice's) responsibilities include, but are not limited to_ (i) Ensuring the overall quality of the
care provided by the aide; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Supervision of the aide's services as described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Ensuring that home health aides providing services under arrangements have met the training requirements
of paragraph (a) of this section.

appropriate identifying information; name of physician; drug, dietary, treatment, and activity orders; signed
and dated clinical and progress notes; copies of summary reports sent to the attending physician; and a discharge
summary. The HHA must inform the attending physician of the availability of a discharge summary. The discharge summary
must be sent to the attending physician upon request and must include the patient's medical and health status at discharge.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule is in response to the ``Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1995,''
and the ``Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1995.'' Section 307(a) of Public Law 103&hyph;332 required
that no funds made available in the Act may be expended by an entity unless the entity agrees that in expending the funds
they will comply with the ``Buy American Act.'' As it did in FY 1994, the Department continues to interpret this requirement
to apply to assistance programs. Section 501 of Public Law 103&hyph;316 only states that it is the sense of Congress
that, to the greatest extent practicable, all equipment and products purchased with funds made available in the Act
should be American-made. Therefore, the Department is taking the position that Congressional intent was different
for awards made by the Bureau of Reclamation. As such, only the provisions in the regulation addressing the sense of
Congress (&sect;12.700) and the notice requirements (&sect;12.710) will apply to awards made by the Bureau of Reclamation
using appropriated funds for FY 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 30, 1994, the Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1995
(``the Act'') was signed into law. Section 307(a) of the Act was entitled ``Compliance with Buy American Act.'' The
section applied to funds appropriated or transferred pursuant to the Act for the purchase of any equipment or product
that may be authorized to be purchased with financial assistance. Section 307(b) expressed the ``sense of the Congress''
that entities receiving the assistance, purchase only American-made equipment and products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 307(b)(2) required that in providing the financial assistance under the Act, the Secretary shall provide
to each recipient of the assistance a notice describing the requirement. No other specific guidance was given regarding
the implementation of this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is revising Subpart E of 43 CFR Part 12, to implement these requirements for awards made using appropriated
funds for FY 1995. No specific guidance was provided by Congress, so the Department decided to continue its implementation
of these requirements based upon the final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 36713).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the applicability of different appropriation acts and the fact that the requirements are different, the
notice in paragraph (b) of &sect;12.710 has been changed to account for the reference to language in Pub. L. 103&hyph;332.
A separate notice included in paragraph (c) of &sect;12.710 has been amended to account for the reference to language
in Pub. L. 103&hyph;316 and its use only for awards made by the Bureau of Reclamation.

Finding of Good Cause for Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking and for Making Rule Effective Upon Publication
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is usually the practice of the Department to
offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, the Department waives notice
and comment on these regulations under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)).
This section provides that notice and comment for rulemaking is not required when the agency for good cause finds that
notice and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. The Department
believes further public comment on the revision of this regulation is unnecessary because the substance of these
provisions is based on statutory requirements governing the award of assistance with appropriated funds for FY 1995,
that the Department is unable to change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Administrative Procedure Act provides that rules be published at least 30 days prior to their effective date,
except as otherwise provided by an agency on a finding of good cause (5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3)). In this case, because this
requirement is a statutory condition of expenditure of appropriated funds in this fiscal year, the Department has
determined that the rule must be effective upon publication.

The Department has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities since it is anticipated that no additional costs will be imposed on a substantial number of small entities
as a result of the rule. This rule does not contain a collection of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act

This subpart implements section 307 of the Department of the Interior and Related Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year
1995 (Public Law 103&hyph;332, 108 Stat. 2499) and section 501 of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations
Act, 1995 (Public Law 103&hyph;316, 108 Stat. 1723). For awards made under the authority of section 307, this subpart
requires that no funds made available in the Act may be expended by an entity unless the entity agrees that in expending
the funds the entity will comply with sections 2 through 4 of the Act of March 3, 1933 (41 U.S.C. 10a&hyph;10c; popularly
known as the ``Buy American Act''). It applies to procurement contracts under grants and cooperative agreements
which provide for the purchase of equipment and products. Section 501 of Public Law 103&hyph;316, 108 Stat. 1723,
only applies to awards made by the Bureau of Reclamation. In addition, for these awards, there is only a requirement
that in providing financial assistance to, or entering into any contract with, any entity using funds made available
in this Act, the Secretary, to the greatest extent practicable, will provide to the entity a notice describing a statement
within the Act made by Congress. This statement concerns the sense of the Congress that to the greatest extent practicable,
all equipment and products purchased with funds made available in the Act, should be American-made. Therefore, for
Fiscal Year 1995 awards, only the requirements in &sect;12.700 and 12.710 will apply to awards made by the Bureau of
Reclamation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard announces a delay in the effective date of regulations governing drug testing, insofar as those regulations
would require testing of persons onboard U.S. vessels in waters that are subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government.
Under this final rule, employees would become subject to testing no later than January 2, 1996, unless the Coast Guard,
in the meantime, publishes regulations indicating otherwise.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On November 21, 1988, the Coast Guard, along with other agencies of the Department of Transportation (DOT), adopted
regulations requiring pre-employment, post-accident, reasonable cause, and random drug testing. Those individuals
required under Federal law or regulation to have periodic medical examinations were also required to undergo a drug
test at the same time. The drug testing required by the rule applies to some persons located outside of the United States.
However, the rules provided that they would not apply outside the United States in any situation in which application
of the rules violated foreign local laws or policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the same time, the Coast Guard stated that the DOT and other elements of the government would enter into discussions
with foreign governments to attempt to resolve any conflict between our rules and foreign government laws or policies.
The Coast Guard stated that if, as a result of those discussions, it was found that amendments to the rule were necessary,
timely amendments would be issued. An amendment was issued on December 21, 1989, and published on December 27, 1989
(54 FR 53286). Under that amendment, drug testing for persons onboard U.S. vessels in waters subject to the jurisdiction
of a foreign government was scheduled to begin by January 2, 1992. A Final Rule was published on April 24, 1991, delaying
the implementation date to January 2, 1993 (56 FR 18982), and another Final Rule was published on July 14, 1992, delaying
the implementation date to January 2, 1995 (57 FR 31274).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the past few years, discussions with other countries have been held, and the difficulty of achieving effective
bilateral agreements has become clear. Although the Coast Guard could allow its regulations to take effect in foreign
waters, the Coast Guard continues to recognize that: (1) It would be difficult for U.S. carriers to effectively implement
the regulations without cooperation from foreign governments; (2) in response, foreign governments could impose
restrictions on U.S. operations; and, perhaps most importantly, (3) there are distinct advantages to be gained in
aligning foreign measures and U.S. measures, especially as they relate to international transportation operations.
For these reasons, the Coast Guard is continuing to consider whether it would be appropriate to apply the requirements
of part 16 to operations in waters subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government in the event that agreements
with other countries are not reached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to allow time to further consider these issues and formulate a decision, the Coast Guard has again determined
that additional time is necessary. Another additional delay of approximately one year should provide sufficient
time. Accordingly, the Coast Guard has determined to postpone again the date by which testing programs would commence
for persons onboard U.S. vessels in waters that are subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The change in this final rule will delay the applicability of the regulations where they may conflict with foreign
law or policy. This rule imposes no additional burdens on the regulated industry. Without this delay in the implementation
date, persons onboard U.S. vessels in waters that are subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government would become
subject to the requirements of part 16 on January 2, 1995. Delaying the implementation date ensures that the applicability
of part 16 will continue unchanged. Accordingly, the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)
to publish this rule without notice and comment and to make this rule effective less than 30 days after publication
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
This final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6 (a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). The economic impact of these changes is so minimal
that further evaluation is not necessary. This final rule modifies the effective date for compliance with Coast Guard
regulations governing drug testing, insofar as those regulations would require testing of persons onboard U.S.
vessels that are subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government. It does not change the basic regulatory structure
of that rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 -->
Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant
in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act
(15 U.S.C. 632). This rule does not require a general notice of proposed rulemaking and, therefore, is exempt from
the regulatory flexibility requirements. Although exempt, the Coast Guard has reviewed this rule for potential
impact on small entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment in this final rule only extends a compliance date, and imposes no costs on affected entities. Therefore,
the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities.

Collection of Information

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order
12612 and has determined that it does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a
Federalism Assessment. The authority to require programs for chemical drug and alcohol testing of commercial vessel
personnel has been committed to the Coast Guard by Federal statutes. This final rule does, therefore, preempt State
and local regulations regarding drug testing programs requiring the testing of persons onboard U.S. vessels in waters
that are subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government.

Environment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this final rule, and has concluded that, under section
2.B.2.1 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation.
This final rule merely extends an implementation date and clearly has no environmental impact.

Summary of the Second Memorandum Opinion and Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second MO&amp;O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 responded to a Petition for Reconsideration filed jointly by the Public Safety Microwave Committee (PSMC), the Association
of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International, Inc. (APCO), the County of Los Angeles (LA County),
and the Forestry-Conservation Communication Association (FCCA) (collectively ``Petitioners''). Petitioners
requested that the Commission not subject incumbent public safety facilities to mandatory relocation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second MO&amp;O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 effected changes to the rules to further the Commission's goals of providing for the fair and equitable sharing of
2 GHz spectrum by new services and the existing fixed microwave services that currently use these frequencies, and
for the relocation of existing 2 GHz facilities to other spectrum where necessary. The rules provide licensees of
services using emerging technologies with access to 2 GHz frequencies in a reasonable timeframe, while at the same
time preventing disruption to existing 2 GHz operations and minimizing the economic impact on the existing licensees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Specifically, the Commission amended the negotiation procedures for mandatory relocation of existing microwave
facilities to provide for use of independent estimates of the cost to replace an existing facility in resolving disputes
between licensees of existing facilities and new service providers. The Commission also modified the relocation
plan to extend the mandatory negotiation period for public safety entities to two years. The relocation plan for public
safety facilities will now provide a three-year period for voluntary negotiations followed by a two-year period
for mandatory negotiations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
First Report and Order
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in this proceeding 57 FR 49020, October 29, 1992, the Commission exempted licensees of incumbent public safety facilities
from involuntary relocation. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Third Report and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
58 FR 46547, September 1993, it clarified the definition of public safety. The Commission's purpose in each decision
was to ensure that essential safety of life and property communications are not disrupted or otherwise disadvantaged.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
MO&amp;O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission concluded on its own motion that it would be in the public interest to subject all incumbent facilities,
including public safety, to mandatory relocation if an emerging technology provider requires the spectrum. Of particular
concern was providing adequate spectrum for operation of new licensed personal communications services (PCS) services,
and operation of unlicensed PCS devices, in major urban areas where there are a large number of incumbent public safety
fixed microwave facilities. It has been recognized by incumbent fixed microwave users and PCS interests alike that
it will not be possible for PCS and fixed microwave to operate in the same geographic area on the same frequency without
interfering with each other. Upon review of the record, the Commission concluded that PCS service may be precluded
or severely limited in some areas unless public safety licensees relocate when necessary. Allowing all public safety
facilities to remain in the band indefinitely would defeat the Commission's primary goal of providing usable spectrum
for the implementation of emerging technologies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Second MO&amp;O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission stated that it continues to believe that it is in the public interest to subject all incumbent 2 GHz fixed
microwave facilities, including public safety licensees, to mandatory relocation if an emerging technology provider
requires the spectrum they are using. The Commission concluded that its decision is supported by the record in this
proceeding. Further, the Commission stated that this decision, along with the associated transition adopted in
previous decisions, as modified in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
MO&amp;O
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, provides a fair balance between the interests of the incumbent fixed microwave service and those services that will
use new emerging technologies, such as PCS. Specifically, the transition policy for mandatory relocation of incumbent
public safety operations required to relocate, summarized below, will not disadvantage public safety incumbents.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

_All relocation costs will be paid entirely by the emerging technology licensee. These costs include all engineering,
equipment, and site costs and FCC fees, as well as any reasonable additional costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Relocation facilities must be fully comparable to those being replaced.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Should the new facilities in practice prove not to be equivalent in every respect, within one year the public safety
operation may relocate back to its original facilities and stay there until complete equivalency (or better) is attained.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. When disputes do arise in relocation negotiations, the Commission stated that they can be resolved best through
individual mediation and arbitration efforts rather than adjudication by the Commission. Thus, the Commission
emphasized its intent to use alternative dispute resolution (``ADR'') techniques to expedite and improve the relocation
process whenever feasible. Resolution of such disputes entirely by the Commission's adjudication processes would
be time consuming and costly to all parties. Therefore, the Commission continued to encourage parties unable to voluntarily
conclude relocation agreements to employ ADR techniques during both the voluntary and mandatory negotiation periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Nevertheless, the Commission stated that it is cognizant of Petitioners' concern that public safety entities
with limited resources not be placed in situations in which they would have to accept less favorable terms if disputes
arise in the negotiation and relocation process. In considering this issue, in addition to or as a supplement to ADR,
the Commission stated that it believes an effective way to expedite the negotiation process and minimize the burden
on all parties in these situations is to encourage parties to utilize independent, impartial estimates of the costs
to relocate the existing operation to a comparable facility. In order to be fair to all parties, the independent estimates
would need to include both the specifications for a comparable new facility and the costs associated with providing
that facility to the incumbent licensee. The Commission stated that it believes that in most cases the availability
of the option of choosing to resolve disputes through the use of independent estimates will provide an incentive for
both sides in a negotiation to work quickly towards a mutually agreeable solution. In cases in which such estimates
are obtained, they will provide a benchmark for an agreement that could avoid the need for the parties bringing the
dispute to the Commission. However, where such disputes come before the Commission, it will expect the incumbent
to have obtained 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
bona fide
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 independent estimates of its relocation costs and to present those estimates to the Commission for consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Accordingly, the Commission modified its mandatory relocation procedures to provide for consideration of independent
estimates by third parties not associated or otherwise affiliated with either the incumbent licensee or the new service
provider. Under this new provision, the Commission will consider the independent estimates of the cost of replacement
facilities obtained by incumbent licensees in deciding any relocation disputes that are brought before it. The Commission
stated that it believes that the responsibility for obtaining independent estimates should rest with the incumbent
licensee, as the licensee will be in the best position to describe to parties preparing estimates the operating requirements
for the new facility. Incumbent licensees are encouraged to present two separately prepared estimates obtained
from qualified professional third parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The Commission stated that independent estimates presented in disputes brought to it for resolution must include
a specification for the comparable facility and a statement of costs of providing that facility to the incumbent licensee.
The specification should describe the design and technical parameters of the new facility, the equipment to be used
in its construction, a statement attesting to the comparability of the proposed new facility to the facility it would
replace, and a testing and transition plan. The cost statement should include individual estimates for the design
of the new facility, equipment, and testing, as well as the transition. Where the two estimates are substantially
different, the Commission expects the participating parties to choose the most reliable and reasonable estimate,
average the two estimates, or obtain a third estimate by a mutually agreeable party. If a dispute is brought to the Commission,
it will consider the two estimates as evidence of the relocation cost but retain discretion to make its own determination
based upon the facts presented to the Commission. In deciding such cases, the Commission stated that it intends to
be guided by the principle of ensuring that the incumbent is provided a comparable facility at the minimum cost to the
new service provider.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The Commission stated that it encouraged public safety licensees to obtain two independent estimates of the cost
to relocate with comparable facilities early in the relocation process. The Commission believes that such estimates
will be very helpful in the negotiation process, including those cases that employ ADR techniques. Moreover, having
such estimates at its disposal, should Commission intervention become necessary, will expedite a relocation process
that is fair to all parties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The Commission also shared Petitioners' concern that public safety systems, especially those in rural areas,
must have adequate time to negotiate relocation agreements. Previously, the Commission recognized that the demand
for the new technology spectrum will vary from market to market and from one area to another and that in some areas, incumbent
2 GHz facilities may not need to relocate as quickly as in areas where spectrum is needed more quickly for emerging technologies.
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
MO&amp;O,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the Commission adopted a bifurcated four-year voluntary/one-year mandatory negotiation period to accommodate
these variations in demand. However, the Commission agreed with Petitioners that public safety licensees may need
more than one year to negotiate agreements where the negotiations do not start until sometime after the voluntary
period has expired. Accordingly, the Commission modified the relocation plan to extend the mandatory negotiation
period for public safety entities to two years. However, the Commission concluded that it would not serve the public
interest in implementing broadband PCS to extend to six years the current five year period of protection for public
safety facilities. As stated previously in this proceeding, the Commission's primary goal is to provide usable spectrum
for the implementation of emerging technologies in an expeditious manner. Therefore, the Commission maintained
the current five year period for public safety facilities by shortening the four-year voluntary period to three-years.
The relocation plan for public safety facilities will thus provide a three-year period for voluntary negotiations
followed by a two-year period for mandatory negotiations. This will provide public safety entities, especially
those with facilities in rural areas, ample time to negotiate and conclude agreements.

(b) Private Operational-Fixed Microwave Service licensees, with the exception of public safety facilities defined
in paragraph (f) of this section, in bands allocated for licensed emerging technology services will maintain primary
status in these bands until two years after the Commission commences acceptance of applications for an emerging technology
service (two-year voluntary negotiation period), and until one year after an emerging technology service licensee
initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations (one-year mandatory negotiation
period) or, in bands allocated for unlicensed emerging technology services, until one year after an emerging technology
unlicensed equipment supplier or representative initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed microwave
licensee's operations (one-year mandatory negotiation period). When it is necessary for an emerging technology
provider or representative of unlicensed device manufacturers to negotiate with a fixed microwave licensee with
operations in spectrum adjacent to that of the emerging technology provider, the transition schedule of the entity
requesting the move will apply. Public safety facilities defined in paragraph (f) of this section will maintain primary
status in these bands until three years after the Commission commences acceptance of applications for an emerging
technology service (three-year voluntary negotiation period), and until two years after an emerging technology
service licensee or an emerging technology unlicensed equipment supplier or representative initiates negotiations
for relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations (two-year mandatory negotiation period).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 206 of The Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;311 (August 26, 1994), (TIRRA),
creates new procedures for shippers seeking to contest motor carrier freight charges and for carriers seeking to
rebill customers to collect additional freight charges.

As pertinent here, Section 206 provides: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A motor common carrier of property (other than a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods
or in noncontiguous domestic trade) shall provide to the shipper, on request of the shipper, a written or electronic
copy of the rate, classification, rules, and practices, upon which any rate agreed to between the shipper and carrier
may have been based. When the applicability or reasonableness of the rates and related provisions billed by a motor
common carrier is challenged by the person paying the freight charges, the Commission shall determine whether such
rates and provisions are reasonable or applicable based on the record before it. In those cases where a motor common
carrier (other than a motor common carrier providing transportation of household goods or in noncontiguous domestic
trade) seeks to collect charges in addition to those billed and collected which are contested by the payor, the carrier
may request that the Commission determine whether any additional charges over those billed and collected must be
paid. A carrier must issue any bill for charges in addition to those originally billed within 180 days of the original
bill in order to have the right to collect such charges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) If a shipper seeks to contest the charges originally billed, the shipper may request that the Commission determine
whether the charges originally billed must be paid. A shipper must contest the original bill within 180 days in order
to have the right to contest such charges.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not foresee a great need for rate dispute resolution once carriers and their customers develop appropriate systems
for quoting and confirming unfiled rates. Based on the economics of truck transportation there is little incentive
for carriers or their customers to become involved in rate disputes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under TIRRA, the future of motor carrier pricing is no different from pricing by other businesses in our economy. Industrial
concerns, large and small, have devised systems for quoting, agreeing upon and billing prices for their products
and services. We are confident that comparable methods will be devised for the trucking industry.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recently, we have received inquiries about various aspects of Section 206. In order to avoid confusion, we will explain
in greater detail how we interpret Section 206 and how we intend to handle Section 206 disputes that may arise. We will
consider taking further action if the need develops for establishing more formal rules and procedures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 206 provides an uncomplicated way to resolve any disputes concerning the applicability or reasonableness
of rates charged by motor carriers of property (other than household goods or those providing transportation in noncontiguous
domestic trade). First, it entitles the shipper to request and receive a written or electronic copy of the basis for
the agreed-upon charges. If the shipper is not satisfied with the documentation provided by the carrier, it must contest
the original bill with the carrier. Section 206 also allows the carrier to rebill the shipper for additional charges.
The law allots a 180 day period from the date the carrier issues the original freight bill for the shipper to contest
the rate or the carrier to rebill. The 180 day period is not the time to come to the Commission, although either party
may do so if the carrier has already responded to the shipper's contest or the shipper has resisted the rebilling. In
other words, shippers and carriers should file with us only to resolve disputes, not to satisfy the 180 day statutory
period. The satisfaction of the 180 day statutory period is accomplished by the shipper contesting the rate with the
carrier or the carrier rebilling the shipper. There is no explicit time limit for a shipper to contest rebilled charges.
However we would urge shippers to do so promptly, and in any event no later than 180 days after rebilling, in order to
permit carriers to obtain a determination from us as to whether any additional charges must be paid before going to
court.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the event the shipper and carrier cannot resolve their dispute, the complaining party should file an informal complaint
with us that documents the dispute. We intend to handle such cases informally under the rules at 49 CFR 1130. Filings
with us must include either a copy of whatever the shipper submitted to the carrier to contest the charges and any response
by the carrier or the carrier rebilling and any response by the shipper. We are delegating authority to the Suspension/Special
Permission Board to handle these complaints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If our handling of the dispute does not terminate it, the aggrieved party must be mindful of the statute of limitations
for filing court actions which is now 2 years from the date the claim accrues but is reduced to 18 months on December 3,
1994, 49 U.S.C. 11706(a)&amp;(b). Congress has given the Commission the jurisdiction to adjudicate these disputes,
but only a court can order the payment of monies that may be owed. In other words, a court action must be filed within the
statute of limitations period. Filing with the Commission does not toll the statute of limitations for bringing court
action.

The Cherokee darter is now known from approximately 20 small tributary systems of the Etowah River, but healthy populations
are known from only a few sites. The Etowah darter is known from the upper Etowah River mainstem and two tributary systems.
Impoundments and deteriorating water and benthic habitat quality resulting from siltation, agricultural runoff,
other pollutants, poor land use practices, increased urbanization, and waste discharges have resulted in the restriction
and fragmentation of these species' current ranges. These factors continue to impact the species and their habitat.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Etowah River is one of three major upper Coosa River system tributaries, the others being the Conasauga and Oostanaula
Rivers. The Etowah joins the Oostanaula River in Rome, Georgia, to form the Coosa River. The Coosa River itself is the
major eastern tributary of the Mobile Basin and empties into the Gulf of Mexico in southwest Alabama. The Etowah River
system drains portions of the Blue Ridge, Piedmont, and Valley and Ridge physiographic provinces. All streams in
the drainage are upland in nature and characterized by high gradients and rocky substrates. Land use patterns of the
Etowah system are largely of a rural agrarian economy, with scattered municipalities, including the encroaching
Atlanta metropolitan area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The diversity of the aquatic fauna is commensurate with the diversity of physiographic provinces comprising the
basin. Many of the aquatic organisms reported from the Etowah system are rare. Records of federally protected species
are known for an endangered fish (amber darter,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A small percid fish, the Cherokee darter is subcylindrical in shape, and has a relatively blunt snout with a subterminal
mouth. The body shade is white to pale yellow. The side of adults is pigmented with usually eight small dark olive black
blotches that develop into vertically elongate, slightly oblique bars in breeding adults, especially in males.
The back usually has eight small dark saddles and intervening pale areas. The Cherokee darter has proven to be distinct
from the Coosa darter,

E. coosae,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a species with which it was previously confused, by peak nuptial males never having five discrete color bands in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cherokee darters inhabit small to medium size warm-water creeks of moderate gradient, with predominately rocky
bottoms. It is usually found in shallow water in sections of reduced current, typically in runs above and below riffles
and at the ecotones of riffles and backwaters. The Cherokee darter is associated with large gravel, cobble, and small
boulder substrates, and is uncommonly or rarely found over bedrock, fine gravel, or sand. It is most abundant in stream
sections with relatively clear water and clean substrates (little silt deposition). The Cherokee darter is intolerant
of heavy to moderate silt deposition. The Cherokee darter, like other members of the subgenus

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is intolerant of impoundment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Cherokee darter is endemic to the Etowah River system in north Georgia, where it is primarily restricted to streams
draining the Piedmont physiographic province, and to a lesser extent, the Blue Ridge physiographic province. The
Cherokee darter occurs in about 20 small to moderately large tributary systems of the middle and upper Etowah River
system. However, only a few sites contain healthy populations of this species. The largest populations occur in northern
tributaries upstream of Allatoona Reservoir. Populations are smaller in tributaries draining the southern portion
of the system. The southern tributary systems tend to drain areas exhibiting less relief and are on the average much
more degraded. Cherokee darter populations are found primarily above Allatoona Reservoir. Downstream of Allatoona
Dam, populations are restricted to two tributary systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Cherokee darter exhibits a disjunct and discontinuous distribution pattern indicating fragmentation and isolation
of populations. The placement of Allatoona Reservoir in the middle Etowah River system has caused much of the fragmentation
of this species' populations. One major tributary system in the upper Etowah system, Amicalola Creek, apparently
naturally lacks populations of Cherokee darters, but contains a relatively close relative and also a narrow endemic,
the holiday darter,

The Etowah darter is a small-sized percid fish that is moderately compressed laterally, and has a moderately pointed
snout with a terminal, obliquely angled mouth. The body ground shade is brown or grayish-olive. The side is usually
pigmented with 13 or 14 small dark blotches just below the lateral line. The breast in nuptial males is dark greenish-blue.

The Etowah darter inhabits warm and cool, medium and large creeks or small rivers that are moderate or high gradient
with rocky bottoms. It is found in relatively shallow riffles, with large gravel, cobble, and small boulder substrates.
The Etowah darter is typically associated with the swiftest portions of shallow riffles, but occasionally adults
are taken at the tails of riffles. The sites having the greatest abundance of Etowah darters had clear water and relatively
little silt in the riffles. The Etowah darter, like other members of the subgenus

 shuns pool habitats and is intolerant of impoundment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Etowah darter is endemic to the upper Etowah River system in north Georgia, where it is restricted to the upper Etowah
River mainstem and two tributaries, Long Swamp and Amicalola Creeks. These streams drain both the Blue Ridge and Piedmont
physiographic provinces. This distribution suggests habitat specialization; all streams inhabited by this species
are geographically adjacent in the most upland portion of the river system. For a fish of moderate to large creeks or
small rivers, the Etowah darter has one of the most restricted distributions in the southeast (Lee

. 1980). The Etowah darter has been formally described by Wood and Mayden (1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Cherokee darter appeared as a category 2 species in the Service's notice of review for animal candidates published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554) and November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804). Category 2 species are taxa under review for listing,
but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat(s) are not currently available to support proposed
rules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service commenced funding a status survey in 1989 to better determine the status of the recently discovered Cherokee
darter. After field work had commenced, another undescribed fish was discovered in the Etowah River system, the Etowah
darter. The survey was modified to address the population status of both these undescribed darters. A final report
was received on March 30, 1993 (Burkhead 1993), providing sufficient information on biological vulnerability and
threats to support a proposed rule to classify the Cherokee darter as threatened and the Etowah darter as endangered.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 6, 1993, the Service notified potentially affected Federal and State agencies by mail that a status review
was being conducted for the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter. Two comments were received concerning this notification.
The U.S. Forest Service stated that it was unlikely Forest Service lands harbored suitable habitat for the two darter
species. They also noted that future Forest Service activities in the Etowah River watershed were expected to decrease,
and that it was unlikely these activities would produce any noticeable siltation effects on downstream populations
of the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter. The Environmental Protection Agency commented on locating specific watersheds
having high cumulative non-point source stream impacts for potential restoration work. This information would
be useful in the recovery of the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter. Neither agency had objections to the potential
listing of these species.

In the October 18, 1993, proposed rule (58 FR 53696), and through associated notifications, all interested parties
were requested to submit factual reports and information that might contribute to the development of a final rule
for the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter. Appropriate Federal and State agencies, county governments, scientific

In response to a formal request by the Cherokee County Board of Commissioners, a public hearing on the Service's proposal
to list the Cherokee darter and the Etowah darter as threatened and endangered, respectively, was held on January
12, 1994, at the Cherokee County Administrative Building, Canton, Georgia. The comment period was extended until
January 24, 1994. A notice of the hearing and comment period extension was published in the

Seven written and 17 oral comments (fourteen at the public hearing) were received regarding the proposed listing.
Federal agencies providing written comments included two agencies in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal
Damage Control and Soil Conservation Service, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps). The Animal Damage Control,
Coosa River Basin Initiative, and Georgia Environmental Organization supported the listing; most of the other commenters
did not. Following is a summary of the comments, concerns, and questions (referred to as ``Issues'' for the purpose
of this summary) expressed in writing and orally. Issues of similar content have been grouped together. These issues
and the Service's response to each are presented below.

These two fishes were recently recognized as species new to science by prominent ichthyologists highly knowledgeable
of fish in southeastern United States streams. A few years prior to the status survey for these species in the Etowah
River system (see response to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
E. jordani
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Status survey collections in the Etowah River system provided material sufficient for ichthyologists to determine
that the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter were indeed valid biological entities distinct from the species they had
heretofore been confused with. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, unique color differences in nuptial (breeding) males of both species were discovered. Publication
of a species description in scientific journal and peer review by the scientific community is the primary safeguard
to ensure that species descriptions are based on sound scientific information. Therefore, the Service accepts the
biological basis of species validity provided in the forthcoming scientific description and distinction of the
Cherokee darter from the Coosa darter (Bauer

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wanted clarification as to the timing of the determination of the Cherokee darter as a valid species
in relation to the impoundment of Allatoona Reservoir, and insinuated that since the Cherokee darter was not formally
recognized as a species at the time of reservoir construction, the preimpoundment records for populations of the
Cherokee darter alluded to in the proposed rule referred actually to the Coosa darter.

As stated in the response to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Issue 1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 above, these two species were recognized as new species within the past few years, and decades after Allatoona Reservoir
was completed in the 1950's. However, the Service is not indicating that these two fishes evolved into separate species
since construction of this reservoir. The evolution of new species is a slow process that takes thousands or millions
of years. There is no scientific basis to suggest the Cherokee darter or the Etowah darter evolved since the construction
of Allatoona Reservoir, or that this reservoir played any part in the evolution of these species. Therefore, the preimpoundment
records of Cherokee darters stated in the proposed rule pertain to that species, and do not refer to populations of
the Coosa darter.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are over 150 recognized species of darters in 4 genera and approximately two dozen subgenera. Darters occupy
a wide variety of habitats in rivers, lakes, and swamps from the Appalachian Mountains to near sea level throughout
much of eastern North America. The Etowah River system alone harbors at least 11 species of darters. Each species inhabits
discreet portions of the drainage and specific habitats within its streams. The habitat requirements of the Cherokee
darter differ significantly from those of the amber darter. However, the habitat requirements of the amber darter
are similar, but not identical, to that of the Etowah darter. The habitat requirements of the Cherokee darter have
therefore not been taken into consideration during the design of the proposed dam.

The Service is required by the Act to protect any species that is in danger of extinction. This determination is based
upon the best available biological information. When the Service first learned of the occurrence of the undescribed
Cherokee darter, a narrowly distributed and potentially imperilled fish in the Etowah River system, a survey was
funded to determine its status. That survey was initiated during the fall of 1989. The following summer, the Etowah
darter was determined to be a distinct and highly localized species, and the survey continued for both darters until
1992. When information was obtained on the population status and distribution of the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter
sufficient to support federal listing of these species, a rule was proposed to afford them protection under the Act.
The timing of the proposed rule to list these two fishes was therefore coincidental with any proposed construction
projects.

From the fall of 1989 to summer 1992, a survey of the Etowah River system was funded by the Service to determine the population
status and total distribution of the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter (see response to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Issue 4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 above). A total of 146 collections at 141 sites throughout the Etowah River system were made for these two fish. Although
sites outside the Etowah River system were not surveyed for the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter, the Service believes
that the fish faunas in surrounding drainages are adequately known to assure that these two darters are not present.
The discovery of additional populations of one or both species within the Etowah River system is possible. However,
based on the extensive status survey conducted for the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter, the Service believes no
further surveys are warranted before listing these species.

The Service is required by the Act to use the best available biological information in the assessment of determining
whether Federal protection under the Act is warranted for a species. The economic impacts resulting from endangered
species protection are not to be considered when proposing to list a species under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 7 of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued
existence of any listed species (see the ``Available Conservation Measures'' section of this rule and the response
to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Issue 7 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
below). The Corps has consulted with the Service regarding the potential effects this federally permitted reservoir
project might have on the amber darter, which occurs in the Etowah River mainstem both upstream and downstream of the
Yellow Creek confluence. The County conducted a study addressing issues pertaining to the amber darter and its habitat
and has made modifications to the dam that should minimize any impacts upon this federally endangered fish. The Service
is currently in conference with the Corps regarding the dam's potential impacts upon the Cherokee darter and Etowah
darter. As mentioned elsewhere (see response to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Issue 3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 above), the habitat requirements of the Etowah darter are similar to that of the amber darter. The design changes of
the proposed dam that addressed the amber darter may possibly also protect the Etowah darter and its habitat. However,
the Cherokee darter, which has a population in Yellow Creek very near the dam site, has different environmental requirements.
The County has proven that it was willing to work with the Corps and the Service in addressing issues related to the amber
darter. The Service commends these efforts by the County, and is confident that a similar agreement can be reached
for Cherokee darter issues. The Service's Brunswick, Georgia, Field Office is currently working with the Corps and
County to resolve specific issues relating to the Cherokee darter. Additionally, for the proposed Atlanta beltway
project, the Federal Highway Administration must consult with the Service's Brunswick Field Office regarding potential
impacts to the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter during the planning and construction phases.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Attorney General has issued guidelines to the Department of the Interior (Department) on the implementation
of Executive Order 12630: Governmental Actions and Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.
Under these guidelines, a special rule applies when an agency within the Department is required by law to act solely
upon specified criteria that leave the agency no discretion. In enacting the Act, Congress required the Department
to list species based solely upon scientific and commercial data indicating whether they are in danger of extinction.
The Service is prohibited by law from withholding a listing based on concerns regarding economic impact and is required
to act, with appropriate public notice, under strict time tables. Any failure to comply may subject the agency to legal
action. Accordingly, the provisions of the Attorney General's guidelines relating to nondiscretionary actions
clearly are applicable to the determination of threatened status for the Cherokee darter and endangered status for
the Etowah darter, and Taking Implication Assessments under Executive Order 12630 cannot be considered in making
this administrative decision. Since the Act precludes consideration of economic factors during the listing process,
the Service's policy is to not consider taking implications at this time.

Based on the results of listing other aquatic organisms in north Georgia streams, the Service does not believe there
will be any major impact to these activities as a result of listing these two fishes. Concerning the use of agricultural
chemicals, the Service consults with the Environmental Protection Agency to determine if pesticides they register
are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species. When the use of a particular chemical is likely
to jeopardize a listed species, the use of that chemical is restricted. Thus, it is possible that the use of a pesticide
could be restricted to avoid jeopardizing either of these darters. Any other new restrictions that might be placed
on farmers or other local landowners would be due to activities involving Federal agencies, which must review their
actions and determine, under Section 7 of the Act, if such actions would adversely affect these species (see the ``Available
Conservation Measures'' section of this rule and the response to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

above). The Service stresses to landowners the importance of maintaining development-free streamside buffer zones
to protect stream habitat and water quality upon which the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter depend. Maintaining
such buffers should avoid many potential impacts to these two fishes.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service concurs that dams may act as traps of alluvial sediments that are conducted down stream beds and overbank
areas during flood conditions. However, conditions below Allatoona Reservoir, despite an obvious reduction in
the bed load and other transported sediments, have deteriorated since reservoir construction several decades ago.
Riverine habitat has been altered due primarily to the disruption of the normal flow and temperature regime in the
lower Etowah River below Allatoona Dam. Dams should not be perceived as beneficial sediment traps; rather efforts
should be made on a watershed-wide basis to abate sources of silt and other sediments resulting from poor landuse practices
from entering streams in the first place.

Summary of Factors Affecting the Species

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that the Cherokee
darter and Etowah darter should be classified as threatened and endangered, respectively. Procedures found at Section
4(a)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species
may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in Section
4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Cherokee darter (

The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Cherokee darter and Etowah darter are both endemic to the Etowah River system in north Georgia (Burkhead 1993).
These species have been rendered vulnerable to extinction by significant loss of habitat within their restricted
range in the Etowah River system. The primary causes of habitat loss in the Etowah River system result from impoundments,
siltation, point source and nonpoint source pollution which includes, but is not limited to, municipal and industrial
waste discharges, agricultural runoff from crop monoculture and poultry farms, poultry processing plants, and
silvicultural activities. Much non-agricultural and non-silvicultural habitat degradation in the watershed
can be attributed to increased urbanization in the Atlanta metropolitan area. All such forms of habitat degradation
and pollution disrupt the aquatic ecosystem, particularly impacting benthic (bottom) habitat. Certain pollutants
may be particularly harmful in cumulative concentrations or if synergistic interactions with other pollutants
or chemicals occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Impoundments have destroyed a significant portion of the free-flowing stream habitat in which the Cherokee darter
lives, and to a lesser extent they have impacted the Etowah darter as well. Based on museum records, at least five preimpoundment
populations of the Cherokee darter were extirpated by the inundation of the 4,800 hectare (11,856 acre) Allatoona
Reservoir, which was completed in 1955. Undoubtedly other, undocumented, Cherokee darter populations were destroyed
by the filling of Allatoona Reservoir. The lower portions of some of the tributary systems that harbor populations
of the Cherokee darter are inundated by Allatoona Reservoir, isolating these populations from other populations
in adjacent tributaries. These tributaries include Butler, Shoal, and Stamp Creeks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Besides Allatoona Reservoir, numerous small impoundments and ponds are scattered throughout the range of the Cherokee
darter and Etowah darter. Impoundments directly destroy stream habitat by converting free-flowing streams to man-made
lakes and ponds and by causing population isolation. Furthermore, small impoundments are numerous enough in the
Etowah system to have a negative effect on both these species by causing population fragmentation and isolation,
thereby blocking genetic interchange. Impoundments also alter the thermal regimen of the stream sections immediately
below the dam and can cause community shifts favoring centrarchid fishes (Brim 1991), potential predators on both
Cherokee darters and Etowah darters. The Yellow Creek population of the Cherokee darter is directly threatened by
a proposed water supply impoundment planned by the Cherokee County government. During low flow periods, 30 percent
of the flow in the Etowah River above a known Etowah darter site will be comprised of water from Yellow Creek reservoir.
Although the effects of this flow augmentation in the Etowah River are not known, the change in water quality and temperature
could potentially have a negative impact on the Etowah darter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Erosion from poor land use practices causes extensive topsoil erosion and subsequent siltation of stream bottoms.
Sources of siltation include timber clearcutting, clearing of riparian vegetation, and those construction, mining,
and agricultural practices that allow exposed earth to enter streams. Light to moderate levels of siltation are ubiquitous
in many streams of the Etowah River system which have populations of the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter. Siltation
problems are severe in many tributaries that have or probably had populations of the Cherokee darter, including Allatoona
Creek, the Little River system, Settingdown Creek, Pumpkinvine Creek, and portions of Shoal Creek (Cherokee County),
Sharp Mountain Creek, Long Swamp Creek, and Raccoon Creek. Siltation and dust from marble quarries in Pickens County
are also major problems in Long Swamp Creek, the only known site where the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter are found
together. A rock quarry has been proposed for Stamp Creek in Bartow County. If permitted, this quarry may have an adverse
effect on the Stamp Creek Cherokee darter population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The extreme isolation or absence of populations of the Cherokee darter in Settingdown, Allatoona, and Raccoon Creeks
and the Little River also strongly suggests localized extirpation of populations. These intermediate streams probably
once supported populations of the fish. Much of the Little River system is heavily affected by large silt and bed loads;
the remaining fish fauna is depauperate and at many sites dominated by species tolerant of degraded habitats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Cherokee darter and Etowah darter are obligate benthic species living, foraging, and spawning on the stream bottom.
Hence, their well-being is directly tied to benthic habitat quality. Negative effects of silt on benthic fishes were
summarized by Burkhead and Jenkins (1991). Silt reduces or destroys habitat heterogeneity and primary productivity,
increases fish egg and larval mortality, abrades organisms, and alters, degrades, and entombs macrobenthic communities.
The geological strata drained by the Etowah River, particularly in the middle and upper portion of the system, contain
micaceous schist. The erosion of this substrata adds an extremely abrasive mica component to the silt which must render
this silt even more noxious to benthic organisms. Current State and Federal regulations preventing silt from entering
streams are lacking, inadequate, or not rigorously enforced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The current rate of development in the counties surrounding Atlanta is very high. The most rapid development appears
to be in Gwinnett, Cobb and Fulton Counties, but it is also high in Cherokee County, which is in the heart of the Cherokee
darter's current range. The effects of creeping urbanization may be seen as far away as Dawson County, where the majority
of Etowah darter populations, as well as some Cherokee darter populations, are known. One of the principal concerns
to the continued existence of the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter is the trend of converting farmland into localized
subdivisions in areas relatively remote from Atlanta. Associated with increased development and land clearing
is increased siltation from erosion, accelerated runoff, and transport of pollutants into the Etowah River system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The tributaries harboring the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter are crossed by numerous road and railroad bridges.
These stream crossings are potential sites for accidents which could spill toxic material into streams. Spills of
toxic chemicals at such crossings could cause catastrophic fish kills and local extirpation of these species. The
high number of bridge crossings over Cherokee darter and Etowah darter streams increases the probability that such
an accident will occur in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attending the urbanization associated with the growth of the Atlanta metropolitan area is a proposed bypass that
would circumnavigate Atlanta to the northwest, connecting Interstate 75 with Georgia State Route 371. The bypass
would cross several Cherokee darter streams in portions of Forsyth, Cherokee, and Bartow Counties. It will also traverse
the Etowah River at the lower portion of the Etowah darter's range. Bridge construction sites, some located in the
upper Etowah River watershed, would be potential sources of sedimentation to Cherokee and Etowah darter habitat.
In addition, since this roadway is not being planned as a limited access highway, the project will foster development
not just at major road intersections, as occurs with interstate highways, but along the entire corridor.

It has been reported that 75 percent of Georgia's landfills will reach capacity in five years (

February 23, 1992). Several landfill sites have been proposed within the range of the Cherokee darter; one such site
occurs between two Cherokee darter streams: Riggins and Edward Creeks, Cherokee County. On the banks of the upper
Etowah River, within the known limited range of the Etowah darter, the Sanitfill Pine Bluff landfill is being constructed.
Refuse may ultimately be received from as far away as New York. When this facility reaches its full potential, it will
purportedly be the largest landfill in the eastern United States. While modern landfills are purportedly designed
to contain runoff, it seems doubtful that such landfills would actually retain barrier integrity for decades to come.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, small species of fish, such as the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter, which are not utilized for either
sport or bait purposes, are unknown to the general public. Therefore, take of these species by the general public has
not been a problem. Publication of this rule will inform the general public as to the presence of these two darters in
the Etowah River system. Considering the restricted distribution and small populations of the Etowah and Cherokee
darters, it would be easy for vandals or unscrupulous collectors to eliminate or seriously impact populations in
specific stream reaches if their exact location were known. The distribution of these species has therefore been
described only in general terms for the purposes of this rule. Federal protection will serve to minimize adverse population
impacts from illegal take, but the Act's penalties are not likely to act as a complete deterrent to such actions.

The Official Code of Georgia Annotated 27&hyph;2&hyph;12 prohibits the taking of these fish without a state collecting
permit. Federal listing provides protection under Section 9 of the Act by requiring Federal permits for taking the
Cherokee darter and Etowah darter. Additional protection is gained under Section 7 of the Act by requiring Federal
agencies to consult with the Service when projects they fund, authorize, or conduct may affect these species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The range of the Cherokee darter has been fragmented, and a significant portion of the middle Etowah River system has
been permanently altered by Allatoona Reservoir. The streams inhabited by the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter
exhibit, on average, moderate to heavy degradation from poor land use practices and small impoundments. These strong
negative forces have caused local extirpation of both Cherokee darter and Etowah darter populations and have induced
range fragmentation and subsequent isolation of the Cherokee darter into small populations. Genetic diversity
has subsequently been lost due to these population losses. The genetic diversity of all populations may be needed
to provide the species enough genetic variability to adapt to environmental change and thus assure long-term viability.
The restricted distribution of both the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter also makes populations vulnerable to extirpation
from catastrophic events, such as an accidental toxic chemical spill. Range fragmentation and loss of genetic diversity,
independently and in concert, clearly threaten the continued existence of these species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by both darters in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,
the preferred action is to list the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter as threatened and endangered species, respectively.
The Cherokee darter is now known from approximately 20 tributary systems of the Etowah River, but healthy populations
are known from just a few sites. The Etowah darter is known from only the upper Etowah River mainstem and two tributary
systems. Both species are restricted to the Etowah River system in north Georgia. These fish and their benthic habitat
have been, and continue to be, impacted by range reduction, isolation by impoundment, and general habitat destruction.
Despite its wider distribution and greater number of known populations, the Cherokee darter appears to have more
of its habitat threatened by these factors, which have already resulted in a higher level of population fragmentation
and isolation relative to the Etowah darter. The restricted distribution of these two species also makes localized
populations susceptible to catastrophic events. Because of these factors, endangered appears the most appropriate
status for the Etowah darter and threatened appears most appropriate for the Cherokee darter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary
propose critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service's regulations
(50 CFR 424.12(a)(1)) state that designation of critical habitat is not prudent when one or both of the following situations
exist: (1) The species is threatened by taking or other activity and the identification of critical habitat can be
expected to increase the degree of threat to the species or (2) such designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial
to the species. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for these species. Such a determination
would result in no known benefit to these species, and designation of critical habitat could further threaten them.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a)(2) and regulations codified at 50 CFR part 402 require Federal agencies to ensure, in consultation with
and with the assistance of the Service, that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of listed species or destroy or adversely modify their critical habitat, if designated.
(See ``Available Conservation Measures'' section for a further discussion of Section 7.) As part of the development
of this final rule, Federal and State agencies were notified of the darters' general distribution, and they were requested
to provide data on proposed Federal actions that might adversely affect the two species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Should any future projects be proposed in areas inhabited by these fishes, the involved Federal agency will already
have the general distributional data needed to determine if the species may be impacted by their action; and if needed
more specific distributional information would be provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations promulgated for implementing Section 7, referenced above, provide for both a jeopardy standard, based
on listing alone, and for a destruction or adverse modification standard, in cases where critical habitat has been
designated. The Cherokee and Etowah darters occupy very restricted stream reaches. Any significant adverse modification
or destruction of their habitat would likely jeopardize their continued existence. Under these conditions the two
standards are essentially equivalent. Therefore, no additional protection for the species would accrue from critical
habitat designation that would not also accrue from listing these species. Once listed, the Service believes that
protection of their habitat can be accomplished through the Section 7 jeopardy standard, and through Section 9 prohibitions
against take. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These two fish are very rare. Therefore, taking for scientific purposes and private collections could pose a threat
to their continued existence if site specific information were released to the general public. The publication of
critical habitat maps in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and local newspapers and other publicity accompanying critical habitat designation could increase the collection
threat and also increase the potential for vandalism during the often controversial critical habitat designation
process. The potential for future habitat disruption within one or both of these species' ranges resulting from the
rapidly expanding Atlanta metropolitan area makes designation of critical habitat potentially more contentious
and controversial, increasing the possibility for vandalism to occur. The locations of these species' populations
have consequently been described only in general terms in this rule. Any existing precise locality data would be available
to appropriate Federal, State, and local governmental agencies from the Service office described in the

Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include
recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.
Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,
groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with
the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal
agencies and the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species
that is proposed or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated.
Regulations implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section
7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action
may affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation
with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal involvement is expected to include the Environmental Protection Agency through the Clean Water Act's provisions
for pesticide registration and waste management actions. The Corps of Engineers will consider these species in project
planning and operation, and during the permit review process. The Federal Highway Administration will consider
impacts of federally funded bridge and road construction projects when known habitat may be impacted. Continuing
urban development within the Etowah River system may involve the Farmers Home Administration and their loan programs.
The Soil Conservation Service will consider the species during project planning and under their farmer's assistance
programs. The Forest Service will consider downstream impacts to habitat of the Etowah darter when planning or implementing
silvicultural, recreational, or other programs in the headwaters of Amicalola Creek and the extreme upper portion
of the Etowah River mainstem occurring in the Chattahoochee National Forest. It has been the experience of the Service
that nearly all Section 7 consultations can be resolved so that the species is protected and the project objectives
are met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 for endangered species, and 17.21 and 17.31 for threatened
species set forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered and threatened wildlife.
These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to jurisdiction of the United States to take (includes
harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, or collect; or attempt any of these), import or export, ship
in interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce
any listed species. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that
has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered or threatened wildlife
species under certain circumstances. Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22, 17.23, and 17.32. Such permits
are available for scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and/or for incidental
take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. For threatened species, there are also permits for zoological
exhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes consistent with the purpose of the Act. In some instances,
permits may be issued for a specified time to relieve undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief
were not available. Since these species are not in trade, such permit requests are not expected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the policy of the Service (59 FR 34272) to identify to the maximum extent practicable at the time a species is listed
those activities that would or would not constitute a violation of section 9 of the Act. The intent of this policy is
to increase public awareness of the effect of the listing on proposed and ongoing activities within a species' range.
The Service is not aware of any otherwise lawful activities being conducted by the public that will be affected by this
listing and result in a violation of section 9.

The Commission is adopting amendments to facilitate registration and reporting by foreign private issuers by allowing
flexibility in the selection of the reporting currency used in filings with the Commission and by streamlining financial
statement reconciliation requirements for foreign private issuers with operations in countries with hyperinflationary
economies. Under the amended rules, a foreign private issuer can state amounts in its financial statements in any
currency which it deems appropriate. In addition, a foreign private issuer that accounts in its primary financial
statements for its operations in a hyperinflationary economy in accordance with

Most of the comment letters received regarding the proposals were supportive of the Commission's efforts to increase
flexibility in the selection of the reporting currency and to streamline the reconciliation process for foreign
private issuers.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes that this flexibility can be provided to foreign private issuers with no loss of material
information that is necessary for a U.S. investor to make an informed investment decision. The amendments are being
adopted largely as proposed, with certain modifications and clarifications in response to public comments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Selection of a Reporting Currency
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments adopted today permit a foreign private issuer to state the amounts in its primary financial statements
using any currency which it deems appropriate. The proposed requirement that the reporting currency also be used
to report to a majority of the issuer's nonaffiliated securityholders has been deleted in response to comments, as
discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters generally agreed with the Proposing Release on the need to increase flexibility in the selection of the
reporting currency. Commenters agreed that rules regarding reporting currency have been troublesome for some foreign
issuers that operate in various currencies. Compliance with the rule previously governing selection of the reporting
currency was problematic for some issuers because no primary economic environment could be identified, and the country
of incorporation had minimal significance to operations. In addition, several commenters cited the preference
of U.S. investors for financial statements prepared using the U.S. dollar as the reporting currency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters expressed the view that, as proposed, the rule was overly restrictive in requiring that the
reporting currency used in filings with the Commission also be used in financial statements that are distributed
to the majority of the issuer's nonaffiliated shareholders. Commenters believed that requirement would force some
foreign issuers to distribute an additional set of financial statements, stated in the currency used for reporting
to the Commission, to securityholders outside the U.S. who would find the additional material of no interest or benefit.
Mandating delivery of financial statements in foreign countries is not appropriate or necessary for the protection
of U.S. investors. Accordingly, the restriction has been deleted from the rule as adopted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters favored increased flexibility but suggested various limiting criteria for determining the
appropriate currency. A few commenters indicated a view that an issuer should use the same reporting currency for
all external reporting. One commenter suggested that the Commission ask the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(``FASB'') to undertake a project on the selection of reporting currency. The Commission does not believe that a need
for new restrictions on a registrant's choice of reporting currency has been demonstrated, and does not believe reporting
currency is an issue that needs to be addressed by the FASB. Moreover, restricting an issuer that chooses to sell its
securities in U.S. public markets to a single reporting currency in all external reports in any jurisdiction is not
practical or necessarily helpful to U.S. investors. Foreign law or custom may require an issuer to publicly distribute
financial statements in a currency that is not as meaningful and relevant to U.S. investors as another currency. The
Commission believes management and its advisors should be free to select the reporting currency that is most useful
for U.S. markets. Of course, reporting practices will continue to be monitored to assess the practiced application
of today's amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter that generally supported increased flexibility in the selection of the reporting currency indicated
that issuers should not be permitted to report in U.S. dollars if the currency of its primary economic environment
or the currency in which dividends are paid is a currency of a hyperinflationary economy or is subject to material exchange
restrictions. That suggestion has not been followed. Domestic issuers that conduct substantial operations in countries
whose currency is hyperinflationary consolidate those operations and present them in U.S. dollars. While translation
from a currency of a hyperinflationary environment into a more stable currency presents some practical problems,
the accounting profession has addressed these situations. SFAS 52 provides guidance on the translation of operations
in hyperinflationary economies under U.S. GAAP, and IAS 21, as discussed in a separate section of this release, also
prescribes a method of translation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule has not been revised, as suggested by one commenter, to address material foreign exchange restrictions and
controls because the resolution of such issues typically is dependent on the particular facts and circumstances.
Registrants are encouraged to discuss unique issues regarding exchange restrictions or controls involving the
registrant and its subsidiaries and other affiliates with the Commission's staff prior to filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amended rule requires, as was proposed, specific disclosure in a note to the financial statements if the currency
in which the issuer expects to declare dividends is different from the reporting currency, or there are material exchange
restrictions affecting the reporting currency or the currency in which dividends are paid. Registrants are reminded
that to the extent that depicted trends and reported results are affected by exchange rate fluctuations, explanatory
disclosure should be provided in filings with the Commission as part of the explanation of the material changes from
year to year required by management's discussion and analysis in Regulation S&hyph;K

The adopted rule applies to financial statements of the registrant. Financial statements furnished with respect
to equity investees or acquired businesses may be prepared using the same reporting currency as the registrant's
primary financial statements or the currency in which that entity normally prepares its financial statements. If
the currency selected for the separate financial statements of acquisitions and investees differs from that of the
registrant, pro forma information and condensed financial data of an investee should be prepared using the reporting
currency of the registrant.

B. Measurement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Proposing Release requested comment on two alternative approaches to measuring transactions that would then
be translated into the reporting currency. Commenters, with one exception, supported the method described as Approach
A. Under that approach, the issuer would measure separately its own transactions, and those of each of its material
operations (for example, branch, division, subsidiary, or joint venture) that are included in the issuer's consolidated
financial statements and located in a non-hyperinflationary environment, using the particular currency of the
primary economic environment in which the issuer or the operation conducts its business.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Financial statement amounts so determined would be translated to the reporting currency using the methodology that
is prescribed by SFAS 52 for translation of financial statements from a functional currency to a reporting currency.
Under that method, (a) all assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate
at the balance sheet date, (b) all revenues, expenses, gains, and losses are translated at the exchange rate existing
at the time of the transaction or, if appropriate, a weighted average of the exchange rates during the period or year,
and (c) all the translation effects of exchange rate changes are included as a separate component (``cumulative translation
adjustment'') of shareholders' equity.

An issuer with a material operation in a hyperinflationary environment would measure the transactions of the operation
in the reporting currency pursuant to SFAS 52, except that no reconciliation to that method will be required in the
circumstances discussed in Section III of this release.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commenters generally objected to Approach B because measurement of reported results of operations and financial
position would be dependent on the issuer's particular reporting currency, rather than the economic environment
in which the business operated. Pursuant to Approach B, all transactions of the issuer and its subsidiaries would
be measured (or remeasured if not so measured initially) using reporting currency, except that transactions of each
of its material foreign operations (for example, branch, division, subsidiary, or joint venture) included in the
consolidated financial statements and located in a non-hyperinflationary environment would be measured using
the particular currency of the primary economic environment in which the foreign operation conducts its business.
Financial statement amounts determined for the material foreign operations of the issuer would be translated using
the methodology prescribed by SFAS 52 for translation of financial statements from a functional currency to a reporting
currency, as described above. Commenters also opposed Approach B because it could not be readily implemented by foreign
issuers that report in several currencies due to the significant data and computational requirements of the remeasurement
process. While the Commission has determined not to adopt Approach B in the amendment, issuers that have historically
presented results using that method are encouraged to discuss with the staff possible resolutions of any particular
problems that may be encountered by the issuer as a result of the Commission's adoption of Approach A.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As was proposed, the final amendments provide that changes in the reporting currency require the financial statements
of periods prior to the change be comprehensively recast as if the new reporting currency had been used.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 To comprehensively recast prior financial statements, a methodology consistent with SFAS 52 should be applied.
That is, the income statement and statement of cash flows should be translated into the new reporting currency using
an appropriately weighted average exchange rate for the applicable period, and assets and liabilities should be
translated using the exchange rate at the end of the applicable period. Registrants that encounter unusual or complex
problems in the implementation of a change in reporting are encouraged to discuss those issues with the staff prior
to filing.

A change in the reporting currency may or may not be coincidental with a change in the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the operations exist. The U.S. accounting guidance applicable to a change in an entity's functional
currency appears in paragraph 9 of SFAS 52. The effects of differences between the method of accounting in the primary
financial statements for a change in functional currency and the method of accounting prescribed by U.S. GAAP should
be explained and quantified where reconciliation is required pursuant to Item 17 or Item 18 of Form

While the number of periods for which retroactive recasting of results is computed generally does not affect relationships
among balance sheet or income statement amounts, it may affect the allocation of amounts between the cumulative translation
adjustment and other stockholder equity accounts. As proposed, the adopted rule specifies that financial statements
of prior periods need be comprehensively recast as if the new reporting currency had been used only since the earliest
period presented in the filing that initially reflects the change in reporting currency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to requests for views regarding the need to disclose the reasons for a registrant's change in its reporting
currency, several commenters questioned the need for the disclosure or doubted that the information would be useful.
Comments of financial analysts supported such a disclosure. The Commission agrees with those commenters that indicated
that disclosure of the reason for the change would be informative, and accordingly, the adopted rule requires that
disclosure.

III. Foreign Issuer Operations in a Hyperinflationary Economy
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As adopted, the rules eliminate the requirement that a foreign private issuer quantify the effects of a translation
methodology for operations in a hyperinflationary environment which differs from SFAS 52 so long as the method used
in the financial statements conforms with IAS 21, provided that the method is used consistently for all periods. IAS
21, as amended in 1993, requires that amounts in the financial statements of the hyperinflationary operations be
restated for the effects of changing prices using a methodology permitted by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Accounting Standard No. 29,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies'' (``IAS 29''), and then translated to the reporting currency.
The adopted rule differs from the proposal in that it limits the permissible method for restating for effects of changing
prices to the historical cost/constant dollar method, as discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters supporting the Commission's proposal cited various reasons including the high cost of reconciliation
for differences in accounting for hyperinflationary operations, support for harmonization of international accounting
standards, and the view that IAS 21 is theoretically superior to SFAS 52. In addition, commenters observed that acceptance
of IAS 21 without reconciliation is consistent with the Commission's existing rule that does not require the elimination
of the effects of inflation in price level adjusted financial statements in the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. One commenter
opposed the proposal, suggesting that the Commission was abandoning the objective of providing the market with comparable
information about issuers. The Commission's acceptance of IAS 21 for purposes of foreign issuers is based, in part,
on the recognition that financial information reported about the hyperinflationary operations of a foreign issuer
will not necessarily be comparable to a U.S. issuer or to another foreign issuer if that information is determined
on a basis consistent with SFAS 52. Since SFAS 52 requires the use of the reporting currency as the currency of measurement
for hyperinflationary operations, reported results are dependent on the reporting currency under SFAS 52. IAS 29
addresses that problem by adjusting measurements in the local currency for inflation before translation to the reporting
currency.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
IAS 29 permits two methods of adjusting for the effects of changing prices: (a) Restatement of historical cost amounts
into units of currency that have the same general purchasing power (historical cost/constant currency method),
or (b) measurement as current cost, with amounts for prior periods restated for changes in the general level of prices
(current cost method). In response to a request for comments concerning the appropriateness of accepting either
method under IAS 29, two commenters indicated that the flexibility permitted by IAS 29 would not promote consistency
or an understanding of the financial statements. In recognition of this concern, the adopted rule does not allow the
use of the current cost approach. The Commission believes that the historical cost/constant currency method is the
preferable choice of the two because it is more likely to facilitate comparison among similarly situated companies.
Under the historical cost/constant currency method, amounts in the financial statements of the hyperinflationary
operation are restated for the effects of changing prices, and then translated to the reporting currency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The elimination of the alternative of using the current cost method is not expected to have a significant effect on
many registrants. Issuers from several countries currently prepare financial statements filed with the Commission
that are adjusted for inflation. With the exception of Mexico, it is the predominant practice in most of these countries
to use a method consistent with the historical cost/constant currency method in IAS 29.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 The elimination of the availability of using the current cost method does not apply to situations in which the issuer's
reporting currency comprehensively includes the effects of price level changes. Such entities can continue to use
the current cost method. That is, the current cost method is eliminated only for those issuers whose reporting currency
is not adjusted for inflation (stable reporting currency), but have operations in a hyperinflationary economy.
Issuers that use the current cost method for operations in a hyperinflationary economy should discuss their particular
circumstances with the staff.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As proposed, a hyperinflationary environment is defined in the adopted rule as one experiencing cumulative inflation
of approximately 100% or more over the most recent three year period, as measured using an appropriate inflation index
which measures general price levels in the country. This definition is consistent with that used to define a hyperinflationary
entity under SFAS 52.
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 Accordingly, foreign private issuers may omit reconciliation of accounting differences arising from the use of
IAS 21 for hyperinflationary operations only when they would have been required to comply with the comparable provisions
of SFAS 52.

Consistent with the rule prior to amendment, foreign private issuers that prepare their financial statements in
a reporting currency that comprehensively includes the effects of price level changes are not required to eliminate
such effects in the reconciliation to US GAAP. Item 17(c)(2)(iv)(A) and Item 18(c)(2)(iv)(A) of Form 20&hyph;F does
not require that the entity operate in a hyperinflationary environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter questioned whether the proposed rule only applies to a subsidiary that operates in a hyperinflationary
environment, or if it would apply equally to a parent company that operated in a hyperinflationary environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The adopted rules would apply equally to the parent company. It would also be acceptable for a parent company to apply
the remeasurement principles of SFAS 52. The legal structure of an entity should not affect the financial statements.

IV. Cost-Benefit Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No specific data were provided in response to the Commission's request regarding the costs and benefits of the amendment
being adopted today. Several issuers did indicate, however, that if the Commission adopted the method to measure
transactions described as Approach B in the Proposing Release that significant additional recordkeeping would
be required. In addition, commenters supporting the proposal with respect to hyperinflationary accounting noted
that the current reconciliation requirements did not meet the cost benefit test because of the complexities of preparation.
The Commission believes that the amendments will reduce costs and that the adoption of these rules will be beneficial
to U.S. investors, as it will encourage more foreign companies to list their securities and raise capital in the United
States and will be consistent with investor protection.

Currency for financial statements of foreign private issuers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) A foreign private issuer, as defined in &sect;230.405 of this chapter, shall state amounts in its primary financial
statements in the currency which it deems appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The currency in which amounts in the financial statements are stated shall be disclosed prominently on the face
of the financial statements. If dividends on publicly-held equity securities will be declared in a currency other
than the reporting currency, a note to the financial statements shall identify that currency. If there are material
exchange restrictions or controls relating to the issuer's reporting currency, the currency of the issuer's domicile,
or the currency in which the issuer will pay dividends, prominent disclosure of this fact shall be made in the financial
statements. If the reporting currency is not the U.S. dollar, dollar-equivalent financial statements or convenience
translations shall not be presented, except a translation may be presented of the most recent fiscal year and any subsequent
interim period presented using the exchange rate as of the most recent balance sheet included in the filing, except
that a rate as of the most recent practicable date shall be used if materially different.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the financial statements of a foreign private issuer are stated in a currency of a country that has experienced
cumulative inflationary effects exceeding a total of 100 percent over the most recent three year period, and have
not been recast or otherwise supplemented to include information on a historical cost/constant currency or current
cost basis prescribed or permitted by appropriate authoritative standards, the issuer shall present supplementary
information to quantify the effects of changing prices upon its financial position and results of operations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(d) Notwithstanding the currency selected for reporting purposes, the issuer shall measure separately its own transactions,
and those of each of its material operations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 branches, divisions, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and similar entities) that is included in the issuer's consolidated
financial statements and not located in a hyperinflationary environment, using the particular currency of the primary
economic environment in which the issuer or the operation conducts its business. Assets and liabilities so determined
shall be translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date; all revenues, expenses,
gains, and losses shall be translated at the exchange rate existing at the time of the transaction or, if appropriate,
a weighted average of the exchange rates during the period; and all translation effects of exchange rate changes shall
be included as a separate component (``cumulative translation adjustment'') of shareholder's equity. For purposes
of this paragraph, the currency of an operation's primary economic environment is normally the currency in which
cash is primarily generated and expended; a hyperinflationary environment is one that has cumulative inflation
of approximately 100% or more over the most recent three year period. Departures from the methodology presented in
this paragraph shall be quantified pursuant to Items 17(c)(2) or 18(c)(2) of Form 20&hyph;F (&sect;249.220f of this
chapter).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The issuer shall state its primary financial statements in the same currency for all periods for which financial
information is presented. If the financial statements are stated in a currency that is different from that used in
financial statements previously filed with the Commission, the issuer shall recast its financial statements as
if the newly adopted currency had been used since at least the earliest period presented in the filing. The decision
to change and the reason for the change in the reporting currency shall be disclosed in a note to the financial statements
in the period in which the change occurs.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is announcing the adoption of amendments to Regulation S&hyph;X, which governs the form and content
of financial statements and schedules furnished by public companies in filings with the Commission, and Form 20&hyph;F,
which is applicable to foreign private issuers. The amendments extend accommodations adopted recently with respect
to financial statements of foreign issuers to filings by domestic issuers that are required to include financial
statements of foreign equity investees or acquired foreign businesses. The accommodations relate to the age of financial
statements and the reconciliation of financial statements to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In
addition, the amendments revise the tests for determining whether financial statements of an equity investee must
be provided, and they eliminate the requirement to furnish certain supplemental financial schedules.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Commission today is adopting several amendments that will extend financial statement accommodations available
to foreign issuers to filings by domestic issuers that are required to include financial statements of foreign equity
investees or acquired foreign business.
<FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>
 The accommodations relate to the age of financial statements
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 and the reconciliation of financial statements to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP'') for
those foreign entities.
<FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the adopted amendments revise the tests of significance for determining whether financial statements
of an equity investee must be provided. The amendments also eliminate certain supplemental financial schedules
that were eliminated recently for foreign issuers,
<FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>
 as well as eliminate two additional schedules that foreign and domestic issuers have been required to include in annual
reports and registration statements filed with the Commission.

The amendments adopted today were proposed by the Commission on April 19, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 Comment letters received from registrants, accounting firms, and related professional membership associations
generally supported the proposals and frequently commented that the schedules were generally redundant to information
already required in the financial statements and that the costs of preparing the schedules therefore outweighed
the benefit. Comments by financial analysts were critical of the proposed amendments, expressing a general concern
about a perceived relaxation of disclosure requirements.
<FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>
 The Commission believes concerns regarding the revised requirements do not consider fully the offsetting effects
of other disclosure requirements that must be met by reporting companies. The amendments are being adopted substantially
as proposed because the Commission believes they will result in reduced costs of registration and reporting by public
companies without loss of material basic disclosure for the protection of investors.

II. Financial Statements of Significant Business Acquisitions and Equity Investees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The changes to Regulation S&hyph;X and Form 20&hyph;F adopted today revise the tests of significance which determine
whether financial statements of an equity investee must be provided, and modify the requirements for reconciliation
to U.S. GAAP of the financial statements of the significant foreign business acquisitions and foreign investees
of domestic registrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Tests of Significance of Equity Investees
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Separate audited financial statements of a company accounted for by the registrants using the equity method of accounting
(an ``equity investee'') must be provided if the investee is ``significant'' as measured pursuant to Rule 3&hyph;09
of Regulation S&hyph;X. The amendments adopted today eliminate one of the three tests of significance made pursuant
to that rule. Pursuant to the adopted rule, significance of an investee is measured by comparison of the registrant's
proportionate share of the investee's pretax income to that of the registrant and of the registrant's investment
in the investee to the registrant's total assets. The determination of significance will no longer require comparison
of the investee's total assets to the total assets of the registrant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While generally favored by commenters, several financial analysts observed that the two tests retained under the
adopted rule may lead to the omission of financial statements of highly leveraged investees because the registrant's
investment and proportion of earnings will be minimized as a result of the investee's debt. However, exclusion of
separate audited financial statements appears reasonable given that the unfavorable financial impact of the investee
is generally limited to the registrant's investment in that entity; losses in excess of that investment generally
are not recognized under GAAP. To the extent that a registrant has guaranteed an investee's debt or is otherwise committed
to fund its operations, the registrant must continue to recognize losses of the investee,
<FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>
 and such losses would continue to be considered in one prong of the two-pronged test for significance. If there are
other material consequences of a registrant's investment in a highly leveraged investee, the Commission believes
discussion of these will be elicited by Item 303 of Regulation S&hyph;K, ``Management's Discussion and Analysis.''
<FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, summarized financial information, pursuant to Rule 4&hyph;08(g) of Regulation S&hyph;X,
<FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>
 that would be required to be provided in a note to the financial statements if the significance of the investees individually
or in aggregate exceeds the 10% level under any of the three tests, would generally provide sufficient information
in these or similar circumstances.

The amendments adopted today permit domestic issuers to furnish financial statements of significant foreign business
acquisitions and foreign equity investees on substantially the same basis as may foreign private issuers. That is,
the financial statements of foreign acquirees, furnished pursuant to Rule 3&hyph;05 of Regulation S&hyph;X as amended,
<FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>
 or investees, furnished pursuant to Rule 3&hyph;09 of Regulation S&hyph;X as amended, in periodic reports or registrations
statements of domestic issuers need only comply with Item 17 of Form 20&hyph;F. Although some commenters questioned
whether the cost of compliance with existing requirements justified the accommodation, most commenters cited the
significant compliance costs incurred under the prior rule and strongly favored the proposal.

Pursuant to Item 17, the financial statements may be prepared on a comprehensive basis other than U.S. GAAP. Quantitative
reconciliation of net income and material balance sheet items is required, but the additional information specified
by U.S. GAAP for disclosure in notes to financial statements is not necessary. However, no reconciliation is required
at all if the foreign business does not exceed the 30% level under the tests of significance which call for the inclusion
of its financial statements of a significant business acquisition
<FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>
 or significant investee.

In circumstances where a registrant furnishes separate financial statements of an equity investee pursuant to Rule
3&hyph;09 of Regulation S&hyph;X, the staff has not required the registrant to also furnish summarized financial
data of the investee pursuant to Rule 4&hyph;08(g) of Regulation S&hyph;X. (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 44, Topic 6:K (March 3, 1983) (47 FR 10789). However, consistent with the recently adopted
amendments for foreign private issuers (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 Securities Act Release No. 7053 (April 19, 1994)), a domestic registrant that furnishes separate financial statements
of a foreign investee that are not reconciled pursuant to the proposed rule should furnish the summarized financial
data pursuant to Rule 4&hyph;08(g) in accordance with U.S. GAAP in its primary financial statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The adopted rules are applicable to a foreign business, as defined. Several commenters recommended that the definition
be identical to the definition of a foreign private issuer, but it is adopted as proposed.
<FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>
 The adopted definition of a foreign business varies from the definition of a foreign private issuer because the relief
available under the rule is intended to be applicable to a branch or other component of an entity, rather than only to
a legally recognized business entity. Also, the rule is not intended to be applicable to a business that is incorporated
outside the U.S. but that is, prior to the registrant's investment, majority owned by one or more U.S. shareholders,
because such an entity can be expected to maintain its books and records on a basis permitting reconciliation to U.S.
GAAP without unreasonable cost.

If the acquired business or investee does not meet the definition of a foreign business, the issuer can file financial
statements prepared in accordance with a basis of accounting other than US GAAP provided a reconciliation to US GAAP

staff practice.

issuers.
<FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>
 Registration statements of foreign private issuers need not include audited financial statements of the most recently

only to the extent necessary to bring the most recent financial statements included in the filing to a date within ten
months of effectiveness.

Although two commenters doubted that there was significant additional cost or difficulty associated with updating
foreign investees and acquiree financial statements on the same basis as domestic issuers, most commenters felt
that financial reporting practices outside the U.S. varied to such a degree as to present significant obstacles to
the preparation of separate financial statements on as timely a basis as is required for U.S. companies.

The amendments adopted today eliminate the following six schedules that had previously been eliminated for foreign

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Rule 12&hyph;02_Marketable Securities_Other Investments including Schedule XIII

(3) Rule 12&hyph;05_Indebtedness of and to Related Parties_Not Current.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Rule 12&hyph;08_Guarantees of Securities of Other Issuers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two additional schedules previously required for both foreign and domestic issuers also will be eliminated:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Rule 12&hyph;10_Short-term Borrowings

1. Marketable Securities_Other Investments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rules adopted today eliminate this schedule. All of the issuers and accountants supported elimination of this
schedule, but several financial analyst commenters did not favor elimination because they believed that the schedule
provided information facilitating comparisons among companies whose accounting is affected by the classification
of investments as either current or noncurrent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Elimination of this schedule was proposed because much of its information is required to be disclosed in financial

Some commenters favored retention of the schedule's requirement for identification of securities of individual
issuers exceeding 2% of the registrant's total assets. The Commission believes retention of the specific disclosure
is unnecessary because other rules applicable to filings by public companies should lead to appropriate disclosure
if a particular investment is material. Disclosures required by Item 303 of Regulation S&hyph;K, ``Management's
Discussion and Analysis,'' include discussion of the material effects and uncertainties associated with concentrations
and risks in the investment portfolio.

3. Property, Plant, and Equipment, and Accumulated Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although comments from financial analysts were generally opposed to elimination of these schedules, most commenters
supported the proposal, citing the cost of their preparation and audit, and their limited usefulness. Financial
analysts reported that they sometimes use the schedules to estimate the age, relative age, and average depreciable
life of each class of a company's depreciable assets. Other commenters agreed with observations in the proposing
release that estimates based on the schedules would not be reliable if the issuer has significant foreign operations
(due to the effects of currency translation on depreciation expense), or if a depreciation method other than straight
line is used. The Commission believes that adequate quantitative disclosure regarding property, plant and equipment
is elicited by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accounting Principle Board Opinion No. 12, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(``Omnibus Opinion_1967''), which requires disclosure of total depreciation expense for each period and the balances
of major classes of depreciable assets. Where the age of capital assets may be indicative of increasing maintenance
and replacement budgets, the registrant would be expected to disclose the material reasonably likely effects on
operating trends, capital expenditures and liquidity pursuant to Item 303 of Regulation S&hyph;K.

4. Guarantees of Securities of Other Issuers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Commission has eliminated these schedules as proposed. None of the commenters cited the need to retain this schedule,
as similar information is required to be disclosed by

B. Additional Schedules Eliminated for Both Foreign and Domestic Issuers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Short Term Borrowings
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The adopted amendments eliminate this schedule. However, as proposed, weighted average interest rate on borrowings
outstanding as of each of the dates for which balance sheets are presented will be required to be disclosed in a note
to the financial statements. In addition, for investment companies, although the schedule requirement has been
eliminated, the information formerly required by &sect;210.12&hyph;10 will now be required to be provided in the
body of the financial statements or in the footnotes. While two of the financial analysts indicated that the year end
rates may not be indicative of the average rate during the period, they did not address the computational problems
arising from foreign currency translation and other factors, as discussed in the proposing release. A number of other
commenters cited those computational problems and indicated that the information disclosed in the schedule frequently
was not meaningful. The Commission concluded that the costs of furnishing the information outweighs its usefulness.

2. Supplementary Income Statement Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has eliminated this schedule by today's amendments. While the amounts of the items formerly referenced
by this schedule (maintenance and repairs; depreciation and amortization of the cost of intangible assets, preoperating
costs and similar deferred costs; taxes other than payroll; royalties; and advertising costs) need not be disclosed
on an ongoing basis by registrants, discussion of discretionary expenses and other items in the schedule, quantified
to the extent practicable, will be required in the company's Management's Discussion and Analysis where necessary
to explain material trends and uncertainties that affected operating results, liquidity or financial condition
of the registrant, or that may be reasonably likely to affect future results, liquidity or financial condition.

IV. Cost-Benefit Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several registrants provided quantified estimates of the cost reductions which would vary from registrant to registrant.
All of the registrants and accounting firms that addressed the cost-benefit of the amendments indicated that the
cost of preparation and audit of the schedules and other information that have been eliminated today exceeded their
benefit. Several financial analysts indicated that they thought that the actual costs of providing this information
is small, and that the benefits exceeded such costs. They suggested that the reduced disclosures could lead to an increase
in the costs of capital due to an increase in investor uncertainty.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For reasons discussed above, the Commission believes that the adoption of these rules will reduce the regulatory
burden and costs of the vast majority of the registrants without a loss of information that is necessary for investor
protection.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is announcing the adoption of amendments to Form 20&hyph;F to streamline the financial statement
reconciliation requirements for foreign private issuers that have entered into business combinations. The amendments
eliminate the requirement to reconcile to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles certain differences attributable
to the method of accounting for a business combination or the amortization period of goodwill and negative goodwill,
provided the financial statements comply with

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission is adopting amendments to streamline the financial statement reconciliation requirements for foreign
private issuers that have entered into business combinations. The amendments eliminate the requirement to reconcile
to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP'') certain differences attributable to the method of
accounting for a business combination or the amortization period of goodwill and negative goodwill, provided the
financial statements comply with 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
International Accounting Standard No. 22
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ``Business Combinations,'' as amended (``IAS 22''), regarding those items.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendments adopted today were proposed by the Commission on April 19, 1994.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Comments received on the proposing release were divided almost evenly in their views.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Commenters questioning the proposal expressed concern about the lack of comparability to U.S. GAAP that would result
from adoption of the proposal, and observed that the reconciled balance sheet and net income information furnished
under the proposed rule would be a hybrid of U.S. GAAP and International Accounting Standards (``IAS''). Those supporting
the proposal cited the cost and complexity of reconciling the pervasive differences attributable to an issuer's
method of accounting for business combinations and, in the case of a supporting letter from financial analysts, the
lack of comparability which exists presently under the U.S. accounting rules applicable to business combinations.

The Commission believes that acceptance of the guidance in IAS 22 with respect to the particular matters addressed
by the amendment, without reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, will not result in the loss of material information that is
necessary for a U.S. investor to make an informed investment decision. Accordingly, the amendments are being adopted
substantially as proposed, although certain modifications and clarifications are included in response to recommendations
and other comments received.

II. Method of Accounting for Business Combinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As adopted, the amendments eliminate the requirement that foreign private issuers quantify the effects of differences
arising solely from the different criteria applied to the selection of the basic method of accounting for a business
combination if the criteria used in the primary financial statements for determining the method are consistently
applied and are consistent with IAS 22. The two basic methods of accounting can be summarized as either ``pooling of
interests'' or ``purchase'' as determined under U.S. GAAP primarily pursuant to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ``Accounting for Business Combinations'' (``APB 16''), or ``uniting of interests'' and ``acquisition'' under
IAS 22.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
APB 16 and IAS 22 have a similar conceptual framework underlying the particular conditions they establish for determining
which of the two basic accounting methods should be applied to a business combination. Both standards acknowledge
limited circumstances under which remeasurement of an acquired company's assets and liabilities pursuant to the
purchase or acquisition method is not appropriate, but the particular criteria qualifying a transaction for pooling
of interests (under APB 16) and uniting of interests (under IAS 22) are different, with IAS 22 being generally more
restrictive.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the criteria articulated in IAS 22 are sufficiently clear so that companies and their
auditors can be expected to apply the guidance in a consistent manner to similar transactions. Although different
from the criteria in U.S. GAAP, the criteria in IAS No. 22 provide a rational and effective basis for distinguishing
the substantively unique transactions for which the special accounting treatment is appropriate. The criteria
in IAS No. 22 appear sufficiently rigorous to restrict the use of uniting of interests accounting to a relatively small
class of similar transactions. The Commission believes that financial statements of foreign private issuers that
distinguish business combinations on the basis specified by IAS No. 22 will provide information that is sufficiently
informative and useful to investors without a reconciliation of that departure to U.S. GAAP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In evaluating the concerns expressed about the effects on comparability of the proposed use of IAS 22, the level of
comparability under current U.S. accounting principles needs to be examined. Although the two accounting methods
of ``purchase'' and ``pooling'' prescribed by U.S. GAAP produce very significant financial reporting differences,
many transactions that are accounted for in the U.S. as poolings of interests are difficult to distinguish economically
or structurally from transactions accounted for as purchases. Because the criteria qualifying a transaction for
pooling under U.S. GAAP are restrictive, a registrant is rarely if ever compelled to account for a transaction as a
pooling if it does not want to do so. The registrant may elect to avoid pooling accounting through essentially nonsubstantive
modifications of merger terms or other insignificant actions. Under IAS 22, it is even more difficult to qualify a
business combination as a uniting of interests, or pooling. Many transactions that would quality for pooling under
U.S. GAAP would be accounted for as purchases under IAS 22. As under the U.S. rule, issuers could elect to avoid pooling
accounting by the essentially subjective designation of an acquirer. On balance, it would appear that using the provisions
of IAS 22 to determine whether a combination is accounted for as a purchase or pooling will not materially affect the
comparability of financial statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A substantial degree of comparability will be retained under the rules adopted today because they provide that the
effects of differences in amounts determined upon application of either the purchase or pooling methods of accounting
would continue to be quantified. For example, if the acquisition method is applicable to a business combination under
IAS 22, differences between the amounts assigned in the issuer's primary financial statements to tangible and intangible
assets and liabilities and those amounts as would be determined using the purchase method applied in accordance with
U.S. GAAP must be identified and quantified in the reconciliation. If a determination has been made pursuant to the
criteria in IAS 22 that the uniting of interest method is appropriate, then differences between the accounting used
in the primary financial statements and the accounting that would be required for a pooling of interests under U.S.
GAAP must be included in the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. In response to comments, language in the amendment has been
modified to more clearly describe the continuing requirement to reconcile the amounts that would be reported under
U.S. GAAP for the particular method of accounting that was determined to be applicable using the criteria contained
in IAS 22.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As suggested by many commenters, the new provisions will not be available with respect to business combinations that
are promoter transactions, leveraged buyouts, mergers of entities under common control, or reverse acquisitions.
The final rule indicates that those types of transactions would continue to be required to be reconciled in full to
U.S. GAAP. The rule also states that other business combinations that are not addressed by IAS 22 are not eligible for
relief from reconciliation.

III. Accounting for Goodwill and Negative Goodwill
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendments also eliminate the requirement that foreign private issuers quantify the effects of differences
arising from the period of amortization of both goodwill and negative goodwill, as proposed. Under IAS 22, goodwill
and negative goodwill is amortized over a period not exceeding five years unless a longer period, not exceeding twenty
years, can be justified. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 17,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 ``Accounting for Intangibles'' (AFB 17''), requires the amortization of goodwill or negative goodwill over its
useful life, except that the period cannot exceed forty years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters raised concerns about the proposed rule because the resulting amount would not be comparable to U.S.
GAAP. However, if the primary financial statements reflect an amortization period that complies with IAS 22, a reconciliation
of differences in goodwill amortization periods does not necessarily improve the comparability of financial statements
in a material fashion. U.S. companies presently exercise substantial judgment in selecting an amortization period
for goodwill, and significant differences among similarly situated companies can be seen among companies reporting
to the Commission. The accounting differences between IAS 22 and APB 17 are not so opaque as to result in the loss of material
information to investors. If the useful life of goodwill or amortization period of negative goodwill exceeds five
years, justification of the longer period is required by paragraph 72 of IAS 22 to be furnished in a note to the primary
financial statements. Registrants will continue to be required under both Item 17 and 18 of Form 20&hyph;F to describe
the accounting differences, even where relief from quantification of differences is granted by this rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The relief from reconciliation permitted under the adopted rule is applicable only to differences in the amortization
period as it applies to aggregate amount of goodwill or negative goodwill that would be determined under U.S. GAAP.
For example, negative goodwill under IAS 22 (the amount by which the fair value of acquired net assets exceeds the purchase
price) must be reconciled to negative goodwill determined under U.S. GAAP (the amount remaining after the excess
over the purchase price has been applied to reduce the carrying value of non-monetary noncurrent assets). In response
to commenter's suggestion, Items 17 and 18 of Form 20&hyph;F have been modified to clarify that point.

IV. Implementation and Transition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Issuers will be permitted by the adopted rule to elect to apply the provisions of IAS 22 in the determination of the method
of accounting for business combinations but not adopt its provisions for amortization of goodwill and negative goodwill.
Similarly, issuers could adopt the provisions of IAS 22 with respect to goodwill amortization periods, but need not
adopt that standard with respect to any other aspect of accounting for business combinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transition guidance in the 1993 amendment of IAS 22 calls for its new provisions to be implemented in financial statements
for periods beginning on or after January 1, 1995, with retroactive application encouraged but not required. As originally
proposed, the relief from reconciliation afforded by the rule would be available only to an issuer that implemented
IAS 22, as amended, in its financial statements with respect to all current and prior business combinations for all
financial reporting periods presented. At the suggestion of a commenter and in consideration of the difficulty of
retroactive implementation of IAS 22, the rule as adopted would also provide relief from reconciliation for business
combinations consummated on or after January 1, 1995, if, commencing by that date, the issuer accounts for all business
combinations in its primary financial statements in accordance with IAS 22. For an issuer that does not retroactively
implement IAS 22, full reconciliation to U.S. GAAP would be required with respect to business combinations consummated
prior to January 1, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As requested by several commenters, the adopted rules clarify how issuers and their auditors should describe the
balance sheet and income statement amounts which do not reflect full reconciliation to U.S. GAAP. Amounts reported
in the reconciliation should be referred to as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP except for the specific items
for which there is a deviation; exceptions should be stated to be in accordance with Item 17 or 18 of Form 20&hyph;F,
as applicable, and different than that required by U.S. GAAP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The accommodation provided under the adopted rule is an exception to the requirement to reconcile to U.S. GAAP that
is similar to the accommodation that had been provided previously to foreign private issuers that prepare price level
adjusted financial statements. See Securities Act Release No. 7117.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The reconciliation provided pursuant to Item 17 or 18 of Form 20&hyph;F must be included in notes to the financial statements
and, accordingly, must be considered by the auditor when expressing an opinion on the financial statements taken
as a whole. The auditor's report is required to comply with Rule 2&hyph;02 of Regulation S&hyph;X, and need not refer
specifically to the note containing the reconciliation. However, if the reconciliation furnished in the notes to
the financial statements fails to include disclosure of all material departures from U.S. GAAP or the quantification
of the effects of accounting differences is materially misstated, or, where applicable, is incorrectly stated to
be determined pursuant to the special provisions afforded under Item 17 or 18 by the rules adopted today, the financial
statements would be presumed to be materially misleading and an exception should be cited in the auditor's report.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No specific data were provided in response to the Commission's request regarding the costs and benefits of the amendment
being adopted today. Several commenters noted that the proposal would address to a large extent the time and cost of
additional recordkeeping and reporting resulting from having to reconcile different accounting methods for business
combinations. The Commission believes costs will be reduced by this amendment. The Commission believes that the
adoption of these rules will be beneficial to U.S. investors, as it will encourage more foreign companies to list their
securities and raise capital in the United States and will be consistent with investor protection.

No. 22, as amended in 1993 (``IAS 22''), and was accounted for using that method in the primary financial statements
may be deemed to be, for purposes of the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, a pooling of interests. A business combination
which would be deemed an acquisition under IAS 22 and was accounted for using that method in the primary financial statements
may be deemed to be, for purposes of the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, a purchase. This paragraph is not applicable for
promoter transactions, leveraged buyouts, mergers of entities under common control, reverse acquisitions and
other transactions not addressed by IAS 22. Once the method of accounting is determined, the reconciliation to U.S.
GAAP should quantify differences between the balances in the primary financial statements and the amounts determined
in accordance with U.S. GAAP as required by this Item.

of IAS 22 to all business combinations consummated on or after January 1, 1995. issuers can either retroactively adopt
IAS 22 in the primary financial statements for all business combinations consummated prior to January 1, 1995, or

1993, with respect to the period of amortization of goodwill and negative goodwill may omit the disclosures specified
by paragraphs (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), and (c)(2)(iii) of this Item regarding the effects of differences attributable
solely to the period of amortization. Goodwill and negative goodwill that is subject to the amortization period under
IAS 22 is based on the amount determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(5)(a) A business combination which would be deemed a uniting of interests under International Accounting Standards
No. 22, as amended in 1993 (``IAS 22''), and was accounted for using that method in the primary financial statements
may be deemed to be, for purposes of the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, a pooling of interests. A business combination
which would be deemed an acquisition under IAS 22 and was accounted for using that method in the primary financial statements
may be deemed to be, for purposes of the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP, a purchase. This paragraph is not applicable for
promoter transactions, leveraged buyouts, mergers of entities under common control, reverse acquisitions and
other transactions not addressed by IAS 22. Once the method of accounting is determined, the reconciliation to U.S.
GAAP should quantify differences between the balances in the primary financial statements and the amounts determined
in accordance with U.S. GAAP as required by this item.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) To obtain relief from the reconciliation requirement regarding the method of accounting, or the amortization
period of goodwill or negative goodwill, the primary financial statements should apply the respective provisions
of IAS 22 to all business combinations consummated on or after January 1, 1995. Issuers can either retroactively adopt
IAS 22 in the primary financial statements for all business combinations consummated prior to January 1, 1995, or
provide a full reconciliation to U.S. GAAP for such prior business combinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) If the method of accounting for a business combination and/or the provisions for amortization of goodwill or negative
goodwill complies with IAS 22, a statement to that effect must be included in the financial statements. The reconciliation
shall state that the amounts presented comply with Item 18 of Form 20&hyph;F and are different from that required by
U.S. GAAP.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and the Employment Standards Administration (ESA) of the Department
of Labor (DOL or Department) are promulgating regulations governing the filing and enforcement of labor condition
applications filed by employers seeking to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations and as fashion models
of distinguished merit and ability under the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant classification. Under the Immigration and
Nationality Act (INA), as amended by the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), an employer seeking to employ a nonimmigrant
in a specialty occupation or as a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability is required to file a labor condition
application with DOL before the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) may approve an H&hyph;1B visa petition.
The labor condition application process is administered by ETA; complaints and investigations regarding labor
condition applications are the responsibility of ESA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments of 1991 (MTINA) amended the INA and the
IMMACT to change substantially the H&hyph;1B labor condition application program, retroactive to October 1, 1991.

II. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 29, 1990, the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (INA or Act) was amended by the Immigration Act of 1990 (IMMACT), Public Law 101&hyph;649, 104 Stat. 4978. On December
12, 1991, the INA was further amended by the Miscellaneous and Technical Immigration and Naturalization Amendments
of 1991 (MTINA), Public Law 102&hyph;232, 105 Stat. 1733. These amendments assign responsibility to the Department
of Labor (Department or DOL) for the implementation of several provisions of the Act relating to the entry of certain
categories of employment-based immigrants, and to the entry and temporary employment of certain categories of nonimmigrants.
One of the major provisions of the Act governs the entry temporarily of foreign ``professionals'' to work in ``specialty
occupations'' in the U.S. under H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant status. 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 1182(n), and 1184(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) will approve H&hyph;1B status for a foreign worker, the
employer which intends to employ the alien, must have on file with the Department's Employment and Training Administration
a Labor Condition Application for H&hyph;1B Nonimmigrants (LCA), Form ETA 9035. Pursuant to the Interim Final Rule,
in filling out the LCA, an employer must specifically indicate, among other things, the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's
job title, the number of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) sought, the rate of pay to be paid the nonimmigrant(s), the nonimmigrant's
anticipated period of employment, and the location where the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) will work. Additionally,
the employer attests to four statements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. H&hyph;1b nonimmigrants will be paid at least the actual wage level paid by the employer to all other individuals
with similar experience and qualifications for the specific employment in question or the prevailing wage level
for the occupation in the area of employment, whichever is higher;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants will not adversely affect the working conditions of workers similarly
employed in the area of employment;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. On the date the application is signed or submitted, there is not a strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the course
of a labor dispute in the occupation in which H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants will be employed at the place of employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. As of this date, notice of this application has been provided to workers employed in the occupations in which H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrants will be employed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The H&hyph;1B category of specialty occupations consists of those occupations which require the theoretical and
practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree
(or its equivalent) in the specific specialty as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the U.S. 8 U.S.C. 1184(i)(1).
In addition, a nonimmigrant in a specialty occupation must possess full State licensure to practice in the occupation
(if required), completion of the required degree, or experience equivalent to the degree and recognition of expertise
in the specialty. 8 U.S.C. 1184(i)(2). The category of ``fashion model'' requires that the nonimmigrant be of distinguished
merit and ability. 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). INS identifies and defines the occupations covered by the H&hyph;1B
category and determines an alien's qualifications for such occupations. DOL only administers and enforces the labor
condition applications relating to the employment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Comments regarding the October 6, 1993, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) were received from 264 entities. Over
half (157) were submitted by businesses; 33 by educational facilities; 23 by attorneys; and 21 by the general public.
The rest of the commenters were distributed among members of Congress (3), the AFL&hyph;CIO (1), the Embassy of India
(1), Federal Government employees (5), State governments (6), and trade associations (15).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposals eliciting the most comments were those regarding the job contractor concept and the related requirement
of posting notice at the place of employment or worksite(s). Of the 157 business comments, 128 concerned the job contractor
proposal. In total, there were 171 comments concerning the job contractor proposal, of which 153 (nearly 90%) opposed
the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Educational institutions commented primarily on the proposal to require the employer to identify the prevailing
wage source on the labor condition application. These commenters uniformly advocated a check-off system, whereby
the LCA-filing employer would check a block on the form to indicate whether the prevailing wage source was a State Employment
Service Agency (SESA) determination, an authoritative source, or another legitimate source.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The majority of the general public commenters were critical of the H&hyph;1B program in general, and suggested that
businesses utilizing H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants should pay user fees and should be assessed substantial fines if found
in violation. In further opposition to the H&hyph;1B program, several commenters (in addition to the general public)
advocated that the proposed regulations did not go far enough and that LCA employers should be required to report the
H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's wage earnings to the Internal Revenue Service and to trade associations in order to facilitate
better monitoring of the LCA employer's activities.

There were 45 comments to this rule. Three issues commented on are germane to this Final Rule: The movement among worksites
of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants, in-kind perquisites, and the definition of ``aggrieved party.'' Worksite movement
of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants is discussed in item 2.a below; in-kind perquisites in item 2.b; and definition of aggrieved
party in item 1.f.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 8, 1994, a meeting was held at OMB pursuant to E.O. 12866. Other than representatives from the Department
and OMB the organizations represented were the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the American Council
on International Personnel, the Information Technology Association of America, the National Association of Foreign
Student Advisors, and the American Council on International Priorities. Written comments were subsequently received
by the Department from the American Council on International Personnel, the Information Technology Association
of America and the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

D. Matters Addressed in the Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While the Department maintains its discretion to engage in additional rulemaking, and such proposed rulemaking
is presently under consideration, this final rule culminates this series of rulemaking activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Provisions Adopted as Proposed
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Geographic/Occupational Scope of the LCA
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (See &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.730(c)(2).) The Department and the public presently are not receiving a true indication of the valid job openings
for which employers anticipate the need for H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants. EPA's operating experience indicates that
some employers have been filing LCA's containing ``laundry lists'' of occupations and areas where an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant
might be needed, in many cases on a single labor condition application. When this practice is coupled with the potential
6-year validity period of the applications, the information disclosed to the Department and to the public can be substantially
misleading with respect to the amount of hiring activity actually occurring pursuant to this program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department proposed to limit an individual labor condition application to a single occupation and to geographic
areas only within the jurisdiction of a single ETA regional office. The Department expressed its view that, under
such a rule, employers would be more likely to file LCA's for the actual number of job openings for which H&hyph;1B workers
are sought, ETA would be able to better manage and collect data on the H&hyph;1B program, INS could exercise more control
over the petitions filed pursuant to a labor condition application, and the Department would be better positioned
to carry out enforcement activities under this program. Additionally, the Department requested comments on this
proposal with specific reference to whether and to what extent this change should promote the objective of receiving
applications which more accurately represent actual job openings for which H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants are being sought,
and whether the change might occasion any unintended operational consequences.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nearly all of the 39 commenters on this issue indicated that if the Department wanted to get a truer picture of actual
practice, instead of limiting the LCA to one occupation and ETA regional area, the Department should limit the number
of workers who could be ``procured'' on one LCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 39 commenters, there were 23 against the proposal and 16 for it. One commenter recommended that the LCA be limited
to one occupation, but with a nationwide filing. Several commenters from the general public advocated that each user
of this program should have to pay fees in order to participate.

Concerning user fees, the Department has taken no action in the Final Rule. Concerning the ``single occupation''
LCA filing requirement, the Department has carefully considered the comments and its own program experience and
has concluded that_without any significant additional burden for employers_the proposed provision, combined
with other clarifications in this Final Rule, such as changing the LCA validity period (item 1.d below) and LCA filing
dates (item 4.d below), will promote the Department's desired result: a truer indication of valid job openings. Therefore,
the proposal is adopted as it appeared in the NPRM. However, concerning the ``single region'' LCA filing requirement,
the Department has concluded, based on program experience and the comments on the NPRM, that it is possible to achieve
the Department's goals (under statutory obligations) without modifying the Interim Final Rule's provisions permitting
the employer to file the LCA with the ETA regional office having jurisdiction over the initial place of employment
if the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is to be employed sequentially in various places in more than one ETA regional jurisdiction.

locations at the place of employment. 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(1)(C). The interim final regulations at &sect;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the course of investigations under this program, the Wage and Hour Division has found that some employers have made
false statements regarding wages and worksite locations and have failed to fulfill the obligations attested on the
applications (for example, by not paying the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants the rate specified). As a means of curbing such
abuses, the Department proposed that employers also be required to provide to each H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant a copy
of the labor condition application, no later than the date the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant reports to the place of employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 29 commenters on this issue, 26 supported the proposal. Several suggestions as to the appropriate timing of
the notice to the H&hyph;1B workers were made by commenters: the employer should be allowed 10 days to meet this requirement;
the employer could fulfill the requirement by providing the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant a copy of the certified LCA; the
employer should comply with this requirement at the time the visa petition is filed, before the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant
reports for work; and the employer should have the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant sign the notification. One commenter opposing
the proposal said that the notice should be provided only if the nonimmigrant requests it.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful consideration of the comments and the Department's program experience, the Department is promulgating
this proposal as it appeared in the NPRM, in order to better assure the protections intended by Congress and to better
safeguard workers (both foreign and domestic) against abuses by employers. The Department is of the view that notification
at the time the H&hyph;1B worker begins work and receives other employment related documents, such as tax withholding
and I&hyph;9 information, is the most appropriate time to provide the copy of the LCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A further clarification of the regulation, based on program experience, is being made in recognition of abuses and
to better assure the protections of workers which Congress intended the notice requirement to achieve. The Department
has become aware that some employers which place H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants at new worksites within areas covered by
existing LCA's have failed to fulfill their LCA obligations, but, because no notices were posted at the new worksites,
the adversely affected workers were not informed of the LCA standards or of their own rights to examine certain documents
and to file complaints. The Department recognizes that it could take the position that an employer may employ H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrants only at worksites where notice had been given, and therefore could require an employer to take two steps
before placing H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants at a new worksite within the same area of intended employment: post a notice

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 file a new LCA. However, such a dual requirement appears to the Department to be burdensome. The protections intended
by Congress can be afforded by having a notice posted by the employer at each new worksite within the same area of intended
employment at the time the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants are sent there to work, without the employer being required to
file new LCA's. The Final Rule, therefore, imposes a less burdensome but equally worker-protective standard, by
providing that the employer shall provide such worksite notices on the first day of work by an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant
at that worksite which will remain posted for at least ten days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A clarification of the regulation, based upon program experience, is also being made in recognition of potential
abuses with regard to the timing of an employer's provision of notice of filing an LCA. The Department has become aware
of confusion and potential adverse effects in situations in which employers provide the required notice of filing
the application to the bargaining representative, or to its employees by posting at the place of employment, considerably
in advance of the date the application is filed (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
six months prior to filing). In order to alleviate confusion and to better assure the achievement of Congressional
intent that U.S. workers who will be working side-by-side with H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants be notified of the employer's
intent and their ability to file complaints if they believe violations have occurred, the Final Regulation requires
that notice, provided by the employer under the fourth labor condition statement, must be provided on or within 30
days prior to the date the labor condition application is filed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department proposed that employers be required to identify (on the LCA) the prevailing wage rate and the source
utilized to obtain the wage information. This would impose no additional burden on an employer acting in compliance
with the program's requirements and would provide additional impetus for compliance by those employers who might
not properly determine the prevailing wage prior to filing the LCA. ETA would continue to certify an LCA where all items
on the LCA have been completed and information submitted on the form is not obviously inaccurate. However, an LCA which
fails to contain this additional information or which indicates a prevailing wage date source not consistent with
regulatory requirements would be rejected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forty-four commenters specifically addressed this issue: 31 opposing the proposal and 13 supporting it. Generally,
opposition was based on the commenters' concern that ETA would reject LCA's more frequently and/or would refer the
LCA to ESA which would initiate an investigation. Eighteen representatives of educational institutions, the most
frequent commenters on this issue, advocated a check-off system whereby the employer merely would check whether
its prevailing wage source was a SESA determination, independent authoritative source, or another legitimate source
of information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered fully the views of the commenters and has reviewed the experience and information obtained
through the program. The Department is modifying the proposed form to incorporate the suggestions of commenters
to some extent. The form will provide that if the employer obtains a prevailing wage rate from a SESA, the employer may
check the box for SESA and enter the prevailing wage rate obtained. When the prevailing wage rate is obtained from any
other source, the employer must enter the identity of the source and the wage rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters have expressed concern regarding this change in apprehension that there will be a greater rejection
rate of LCAs on the part of ETA. ETA will continue to follow the guidance of the statute and the regulation and will not
reject an LCA unless there are obvious omissions or errors. Of course if the employer fails to enter the identity of
the source of a prevailing wage rate, or enters a source that is obviously not an acceptable source, ETA will reject
the LCA.

may not exceed 6 years. Section 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.750 of the interim final H&hyph;1B regulations published at 57 FR 1316 (January 13, 1992) provides that a certified
labor condition application shall be valid for the period of employment indicated on Form ETA 9035; in no event can
the validity period of a labor condition application (LCA) exceed 6 years. However, the INS's regulations, at 8 CFR
214.2(h)(9)(iii)(B) (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

) and (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), limit the validity of a certified petition to 3 years or the expiration of the validity period of the labor condition
application, whichever comes sooner. The Department proposed to bring the validity period of LCA's into conformity
with INS's regulations by reducing the validity period of a labor condition application from 6 years to 3 years. The
validity period would begin with the starting date entered by the employer in the ``Period of Employment'' section
of Item 7 on the LCA or the date ETA certifies the LCA, whichever is later. Any LCA previously filed with and certified
by ETA, however, would remain valid for up to six years or the ending date of employment as certified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirty commenters addressed this issue_16 opposing the proposal (primarily businesses and attorneys) and 14 advocating
the proposal (primarily educational institutions and State governments). Trade associations were divided_4 pro
and 4 con. Those opposing the proposal generally expressed concerns that there would be too much paperwork, that the
proposal was burdensome, and that the proposal would hamper valid users. Several of those supporting the proposal
expressed the view that the LCA should not be valid for more than 1 year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Department is mindful of the concerns expressed by commenters opposed to the proposal, the need for uniformity
in the DOL and INS administration of the program and avoidance of confusion among H&hyph;1B employers and nonimmigrants
outweigh any potential burdens. Therefore, the Department is promulgating this proposal as it appeared in the NPRM.
This proposal, in conjunction with the deletion of the prevailing wage update provision, should reduce the burden
on employers by providing a consistent timetable for DOL and INS filing requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department became aware that this regulatory provision did not address the potentially abusive situation in
which an employer with a certified labor condition application could petition for additional H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants
in the event of a labor dispute subsequent to the filing and certification of the application, and thus use H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrants to break a strike or to weaken the bargaining position of U.S. workers. Such use of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants
to weaken U.S. workers' bargaining position contrary to the clear intent of the law could be achieved by employers
hiring H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants directly or obtaining such workers from job contractors. Therefore, to prevent
this potential abuse, the Department proposed to amend the regulations to prohibit an employer from using a certified
labor condition application to file visa petitions with INS for an occupation in which a strike, lockout, or work stoppage
in the course of a labor dispute occurs at the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's worksite.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Further, to prevent employers from obtaining H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants in the event of a labor dispute, the Department
proposed, through the proposed new &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.733, to prohibit employers from placing H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants in employment at worksites in occupations that
are involved in a strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the course of a labor dispute. Modification of Form ETA 9035 was
proposed so that employers would be required to attest that they would not use the labor condition application in support
of any petition filed with INS for H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants if a strike, lockout, or work stoppage in the course of a
labor dispute involves the occupation covered by the LCA at the place of employment at any time during its validity
period after the labor condition application is certified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also proposed to amend the regulations to require employers to notify DOL within 3 days of the start
of a strike, lockout, or other work stoppage in the course of a labor dispute in the occupation of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s)
at any worksite. Upon receiving such a notification, the Department would undertake the necessary factfinding to
determine whether the Secretary shall issue a strike determination to the INS pursuant to the INS's regulations at
8 CFR 214.2(h)(17). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments from 18 parties addressed this issue specifically, with over half against the proposal. However, all those
comments opposing this proposal were conditional, suggesting that the restriction would be acceptable if it is limited
to the occupation in which the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is employed (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonimmigrant's employment would be permitted in an occupation other than one(s) subject to strike/lockout). Since
the proposal was, in fact, so limited, these commenters' concerns would be alleviated by careful attention to the
regulatory language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful consideration of the comments, the Department is promulgating this proposal as it appeared in the NPRM,
applicable not only to job contractors but to all employees, and relative to strikes, lockouts or other work stoppages
in the occupational classification of a potential H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant at a given worksite. See also pages 31&hyph;32
regarding the provision for placement of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants in an area of employment for which the employer
does not have a valid LCA on file.

f. ``Interested Party'' and ``Aggrieved Party'' definitions
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (See &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.715.) In section 212(n)(2) of the INA, Congress directed the Department to establish a process to respond to complaints
from ``aggrieved'' parties and to provide opportunities for administrative hearings for ``interested'' parties
following investigative determinations. 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2). The legislative history reflects Congress' intention
that the Department's enforcement process would be the means for protecting both U.S. and foreign workers; no comprehensive
pre-admission screening or review process was established. The Department concluded, in order to comply with the
Congressional mandate for effective enforcement, that the terms ``aggrieved'' and ``interested'' party should
be defined broadly in a manner consistent with their common meaning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, the Department proposed that ``aggrieved party or organization'' would be defined as one whose operations
or interests are adversely affected by the alleged violation(s). Based on the Department's experience regarding
the scope and nature of adverse effects of violations, as well as the sources for reliable, actionable allegations
of violations, the Department proposed that the definition of the term ``aggrieved party or organization'' would
encompass not only private-sector persons and organizations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 workers, their representatives, competitors of the allegedly violating employer), but also government agencies
and officials (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Department of State consular officers, State Employment Security Agency Officials).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department also proposed that ``interested party'' would be defined to include persons and entities who are affected
by the employer's action or the investigative determination at issue. The Department did not propose that such an
individual need be adversely affected. By using the term ``interested'' (rather than ``aggrieved'') to identify
the parties for whom hearing opportunities would be offered, Congress clearly mandated a broader class of persons
for these rights than for investigations in response to complaints. The Department's broad definition, based on
the Department's experience, would encompass both private and public entities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twenty-three NPRM commenters addressed these proposed definitions_18 opposed and 5 in support. All 10 business
commenters and half of the trade association commenters were opposed to the proposal. Almost all commenters expressed
the view that there was a connection between the Department's proposed definition of an aggrieved party and the Department's
proposal regarding directed investigations; commenters viewed complaints from government agencies as an alternative
avenue to achieving the opportunity to conduct directed investigations. See 1.g. (Directed Investigations) below.
Two commenters to the Interim Final Rule proposed that the term ``aggrieved party'' should not include someone who
provides frivolous or harassment complaints against an employer; these commenters also suggested that if the complainant's
allegation is not sustained in a DOL proceeding, the complainant should be liable for any administrative costs incurred
for the proceeding(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statute at 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)(A) provides that the Secretary of Labor shall conduct an investigation if there
is reasonable cause to believe that an LCA-filing employer failed to meet a condition specified in the labor condition
application or misrepresented a material fact in the application. A complainant providing such information has
a right to provide it to the Secretary of Labor regardless of the complaint's resolution. Consequently, the Department
cannot accept the proposal that the complainant should be liable for any administrative costs incurred from the proceeding(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the comments, legislative intent, and programmatic experience, the Department is promulgating
these proposals to add these definitions as they appeared in the NPRM, in order to achieve the Congressional intent
of protection for workers and other affected parties through fair and effective post-admission investigations
and administrative hearings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.710.) As a result of its experience in operating the H&hyph;1B program and after consideration of the comments on
the proposed rule, the Department has determined that it is neither necessary nor appropriate to limit its post-admission
investigation of possible LCA violations to those where complaints have been filed by aggrieved parties. Thus the
Final Rule allows post-admission investigations which the Department may conduct on its own initiative. This has
no impact on the pre-admission LCA approval process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change in no way contravenes the Congressional intent. Labor condition applications, as required under the INA,
continue to be accepted and certified unless incomplete or obviously inaccurate. No extensive weighing of evidence
or investigation is added to the pre-admission LCA process, and the entry of the H&hyph;1B workers to the United States
and to the employment is in no way slowed. The change, however, facilitates enforcement by removing a regulatorily-imposed
impediment from the Department's post-approval investigative authority, so that the program's purposes can be
better served and covered workers better protected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The authority to conduct non-complaint investigations is not viewed nor intended by the Department as a mandate to
conduct sweeping enforcement actions. Rather, in light of resource constraints and compelling enforcement priorities,
the Department anticipates that its discretion for self-initiated investigations will be exercised sparingly,
in circumstances where the Wage and Hour Administrator has reason to believe that H&hyph;1B violations may be occurring
or have occurred. An investigation of an H&hyph;1B employer could be undertaken, for example, where the Administrator
becomes aware of a possible violation of an employer's LCA as the result of information obtained in the course of an
investigation of another employer, in the course of an investigation of the employer under another statute or another
LCA, or as the result of the receipt of public information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Final Rule brings the H&hyph;1B program in line with regulations and practice under the H&hyph;1A nonimmigrant
nurses' program. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 20 CFR 655.400(b) and 655.405(a). Under the H&hyph;1A program, which has statutory enforcement language similar
to the H&hyph;1B program, investigations have been conducted since the initiation of that program as a result of a
complaint or otherwise, and there has been no sweeping directed enforcement program as a result.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Originally, the Department questioned its authority to conduct post-admission directed investigations under
the H&hyph;1B program, because discussion of the enforcement aspects of the H&hyph;1B program in the legislative
history spoke of it as being ``complaint-driven.'' However, re-examination of those statements_in context_shows
that they consistently were made for the purpose of limiting DOL pre-acceptance review and investigation of the labor
condition application; the statements were not directed to the scope of the Department's authority to investigate
the LCA

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to being consistent with the Department's regulations and practice under the similar H&hyph;1A program,
post-admission directed enforcement in the H&hyph;1B program clearly is not prohibited by and can be supported under
an analysis of the language of the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 212(n)(2)(A) of the INA directs the Secretary to establish a process for the receipt, investigation, and
disposition of complaints. 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)(A).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 212(n)(2)(B) states that, ``[u]nder such process [established pursuant to subparagraph (A)], the Secretary
shall provide, within 30 days after such a complaint is filed, for a determination as to whether or not a reasonable
basis exists to make a finding described in subparagraph (C).'' 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)(B).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike subparagraph (B), subparagraphs (C) and (D) of section 212(n)(2), which provide for notice and opportunity
for a hearing for failure to meet a condition, for sanctions, and for back pay orders, do not refer back to ``such process''
as must be established pursuant to subparagraph (A). 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2) (C) and (D). Thus, subparagraphs (C) and
(D) stand on their own as processes for sanctioning employers which violate the terms of certified labor condition
applications. Such employers may be placed in the subparagraphs (C) and/or (D) notice and hearing processes either
as a result of a complaint and investigation under subparagraphs (A) and (B) or as a result of some other action, such
as a post-admission investigation undertaken by the Department on its own accord.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated above, this is essentially the same statutory framework under which the Department investigates and
sanctions H&hyph;1A program violations in the absence of a complaint. See 8 U.S.C. 1182(m)(2)(E) (ii), (iii), (iv),
and (v).

In addition to making enforcement more consistent across these programs, the Department's directed investigations
of possible violations of certified H&hyph;1B labor condition applications would enhance compliance under the
program and better assure protection of U.S. and foreign workers. Such protection is consistent with a general Congressional
principle in enacting immigration laws_to provide for the admission of foreign workers under terms and conditions
of employment that do not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. See,

is not consistent with that principle for the Department to be required to ignore_after approval of an LCA_information
or evidence on possible H&hyph;1B violations received other than through a complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifty-three commenters addressed this proposal_43 opposing and 10 advocating. Those opposing suggest that the
statute does not allow this proposal and that to permit directed investigations would be too disruptive, intrusive,
and problematic.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department is keenly aware of the regulated community's concern and has carefully considered the views expressed
by commenters. However, in light of the statutory language and purpose, the legislative history, the Department's
experience in the program, and the Department's intentions as to the limited use of directed investigations, the
Department has determined to promulgate the directed investigation proposal in this Final Rule.

.735.) Until the NPRM, the Department had indicated that job contractors would be treated like any other employer
under the H&hyph;1B program. After obtaining considerable programmatic experience regarding the operations and
effects of job contractors using H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants, the Department proposed to clarify how LCA's should be
completed by job contractors, and proposed to amend the regulations to create certain additional standards for such
employers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, as part of the proposal to develop special procedures for job contractors, the Department defined the
term ``job contractor'' and the proposed requirements to be met, including the general requirement to assure that
the information to be provided on the LCA in Item 7 (occupational information) must pertain to the location(s) (city
and State) of any and all worksite entities. The Department further proposed that a job contractor filing an LCA must
indicate thereon the place of employment at which the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant will actually work (and for which the
prevailing wage must be determined) as opposed to the employer's headquarters or office location if such location
is different from the place of employment. The Department also proposed that, if the contractor wishes to relocate
the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant to work at any location not listed on a certified LCA, an appropriate LCA shall be filed
and certified (and the appropriate prevailing wage determined) before any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant may be employed
at that location. The NPRM addressed other job contractor matters, such as the contractor's actual wage obligation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 264 comments received in response to the NPRM, 171 commented on the job contractor proposal and 153 (nearly 90%)
opposed it_128 of those 153 coming from business commenters. The negative comments related to the concept as a whole
or related to a part of it such as the nationwide actual wage, worksite posting, and place of employment designation
on the labor condition application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Senator Alan K. Simpson expressed concern for the employer's ability to find workers to fill real health care needs,
especially in the physical therapist occupation. Other commenters expressed concern that the proposed rule would
impose special hardships on job contractors, would be onerous, and would be discriminatory. Several commenters
suggested that the Department consider a time test methodology, rather than a ``job contractor'' concept, in identifying
the responsibilities of an employer who places H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants at worksites owned or controlled by entities
other than the employer. Suggestions for the duration of temporary placement ranged from 30 days to 180 days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the comments received in response to the January 13, 1992 Interim Final Rule, concerning the worksite movement
of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants, 13 commenters (11 of which were businesses) expressed the view that the initial LCA filing
should be sufficient when an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is transferred between temporary worksites such as branch offices
or customer offices. These comments advanced the position that an employer should be able to move H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants
to worksites where it is anticipated that the tour of duty will be of a short or temporary nature.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered carefully the comments concerning the job contractor concept as proposed and has decided_at
this time_not to establish special procedures applicable only to those businesses operating as job contractors.
At present, based on the overwhelming weight of the comments and the Department's experience in the program, the Final
Rule contains a modification of the proposed rule, to implement a ``time test'' for short-term assignments of H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrants to worksite(s) outside the area(s) of employment covered by already-certified LCA's whether the
new worksite is another establishment of the employer or is the worksite of another entity (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
customer of a job contractor providing H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants or services provided by H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants
at the customer's location). The Final Rule is both less burdensome for employers and more protective of workers than
was the provision as proposed in the NPRM.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department recognizes that it is common practice for employers_not only job contractors, but also other employers
which operate in more than one place of employment within the United States_to move H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants from
one place of employment (worksite) to another for short periods of time in response to demands of business. The Final
Rule takes into consideration the practical and real world experience of short-term placement of employees.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Final Rule applying to all LCA-filing employers includes a 90-workday placement option within a three-year period,
beginning with the first work day at any worksite in a new area of intended employment, for an employer who shifts H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrants to any worksite(s) outside the location listed on the employer's already-certified LCA. The 90-day
option would apply separately for each area of intended employment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
90 cumulative days for Los Angeles, 90 cumulative days for San Francisco). Under this option, an employer may place
H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at such worksite(s)_without filing a new LCA (and thus without meeting the notice, prevailing
wage, and actual wage requirements for such area of intended employment)_provided that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. No H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant continues to work at a worksite in such area beyond 90 cumulative workdays 
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
by H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants at all worksites within the area (starting with the first day on which any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant
worked at any worksite in the area) and makes no further placement of such worker(s) in such area within the three-year
period which began with the first day of placement, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) working in the area is (are) compensated at the required wage rate applicable under
the employer's already-certified LCA plus expenses for the placement area of employment at no less than the per diem
rate for such area and transportation reimbursement for Federal Government employees as published in the Code of
Federal Regulations at 41 CFR part 301 (the Department has used the regulations promulgated by the General Services
Administration for Federal employees, as we are unaware of any other universally available source of this information
for employers), and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does not place an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant at a worksite where there is a strike or lockout in the same occupational
classification as the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of course at any time an employer may file a new LCA covering the new area of intended employment (complying with all
LCA requirements, including determination of actual and prevailing wage rates as well as notice to employees). This
can be done in advance of the placement or, if such new LCA is filed and certified after placement, the employer can cease
payment of per diem and transportation rates. If, at the accumulation of 90 workdays, the employer has H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants
at any worksite(s) in the new area of intended employment, the employer must have filed and received approval of a new
LCA and complied with all requirements for such filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This 90-workday placement option does not apply to the placement of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants at any worksite(s) within
an area covered by an already-certified LCA filed by the employer. Such worksite(s) would be encompassed within and
fully subject to the requirements of that LCA, including prevailing wage and worksite notice(s) (see &sect;c.1.b
Notification, above, regarding notification at new worksites). The only additional action required of the employer
in this circumstance is to post the notice for a period of 10 days at the new worksite.

.731 (c).) At several stages in the rulemaking process, the Department has addressed the issue of what constitutes
the payment of wages for purposes of an employer satisfying the required wage obligation under the H&hyph;1B program.
This matter was discussed in some detail in the Preambles to the January 13, 1992, Interim Final Rule (57 FR 1316, 1322)
and the October 6, 1993, Proposed Rule (58 FR 52152, 52154). The rulemaking has also dealt with the related issue of
guidelines or standards for allowable deductions from employee wages under the program. Based on careful consideration
of the comments, the legislative intent, and extensive program experience, the Department in the Final Rule is adopting
a ``bright line'' test for ``payment of wages,'' coupled with a three-part standard for authorized deductions. Taken
together, these standards enable employers to determine, with certainty, their obligations and options, assure
employees will be afforded their rights under the law, and better enable the Department, in its enforcement proceedings,
to identify violations, while leaving bona fide, valid pay practices unhampered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principal focal point in the rulemaking, with regard to payment of wages, has been the matter of whether ``in-kind''
perquisites or direct or indirect payments other than cash constitute wages. On this point, the Department has taken
the position in the interim final and the Proposed Rule, as well as in the administration and enforcement of the program,
that such wage credit is not permitted. However, in the Preamble to the Interim Final Rule, the Department set out possible
standards for wage credit, and invited comments as to the appropriateness of these, or some other, tests. A total of
39 commenters on the interim final and the Proposed Rule responded to this point. Six of these submitted comments to
both Rules, with two of the six modifying their views in their second comments. Eight of the 39 commenters (including
the AFL&hyph;CIO) suggested that the Department should not permit any in-kind wage credit. The other 31 commenters
urged the Department to permit such wage credit. While none of these commenters endorsed the tests set out in the Interim
Final Rule's Preamble, several of them suggested that the regulatory standard should be a flexible test that would
take into account the peculiarities of the employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 family relocation expenses). Several others (including Senators Alan K. Simpson and David Durenberger) suggested
that the regulatory standard should focus on the employer's actual costs in employing the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant,
as well as on the comparative costs of employing such a worker and a U.S. worker. Seven of the 39 commenters (including
a multinational computer software company, a multinational pharmaceutical company, a national association of
computer businesses, and a national association on international personnel concerns) suggested that, as a regulatory
standard, the Department should permit the employer to credit as wages any payment or perquisite which is reported
to the Internal Revenue Service as the employee's wages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has considered carefully all the comments, and has found many of them persuasive and helpful with regard
to appropriate regulatory standards. In addition, the Department has reviewed thoroughly the information obtained
through administration and enforcement of the program regarding various pay practices and expenditures in the employment
of nonimmigrants in the U.S. Based on these considerations and review, the Department has concluded that, in determining
the ``wages paid'' for purposes of the employer's satisfaction of the H&hyph;1B required wage, it is not necessary
or appropriate to focus on the issue of in-kind wages. Instead, the Department has concluded the regulatory standard
should consider the broader picture of compensation to employees and costs to employers in the employment of H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrants. Further, in the Department's view, the regulation should provide a practical, predictable, and
somewhat flexible standard, so that the regulated community, as well as the Department, can act with confidence in
assuring compliance with the Act's requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, the Department is promulgating a Final Rule which modifies the NPRM provision to create a less burdensome, more
effective, ``bright line'' test for ``wages paid.'' Under this test, any compensation which is treated as the H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrant employee's earnings for income tax and FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act_social security
tax) proposes will be considered to be wages paid for purposes of the H&hyph;1B program. Amounts to be treated as ``wages
paid'' shall be paid to the employee free and clear when due, except that certain deductions from wages may be made by
the employer in accordance with the restrictions set forth in the regulation and discussed below. In order to claim
such ``wages paid,'' the employer shall document that all required earnings reports have been filed and withholdings
(including the employer's FICA tax) have been paid to appropriate governmental entities, in accordance with applicable
laws (including any payments in the employee's home country pursuant to any totalization arrangement between the
social security systems of the U.S. and such home country, as authorized by section 233 of the Social Security Act,
42 U.S.C. 433). The wages of salaried employees are due in pro-rata installments, except that some limited flexibility
with regard to pro rata installments is provided for the employer which clearly documents the use of supplemental
payments (such as quarterly bonuses) as described in the regulation.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the closely related matter of deductions from wages, in the Proposed Rule the Department set out a multi-part test,
and requested public comment as to the appropriateness of that or some other standard and as to whether the H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrant's international travel expenses to initially come and finally return from employment should be considered
a business expense not susceptible to recoupment by the employer through wage deductions. Ten commenters responded
on the deductions issue. Seven of the 10 opposed the proposed test, for a variety of reasons. On the transportation
expense sub-issue, five commenters asserted that the costs should be considered a business expense, and two commenters
took the opposite position (with one arguing that the Department lacked statutory authority to impose such costs
on an employer).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a careful review of these comments and the information which the Department has obtained through the administration
and enforcement of the program, the Department has concluded that a flexible, three-part test on allowable deductions
will be promulgated, so as to be less burdensome for employers but fair and protective for workers. Under this test,
three categories of deductions are authorized: those required by law; those that are reasonable and customary in
the occupation and area of intended employment; and those that are voluntary on the part of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant.
While each of these categories has regulatory restrictions, the test, taken as a whole, affords significant latitude
for employers and H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants to achieve any bona fide arrangement to facilitate the employment situation.
The flexible test does 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 permit the employer situation. The flexible test does 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 permit the employer to impose the burden of business expense(s) on the worker.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based upon the comments and the Department's reading of the statute, for purposes of this regulation, the Department
has determined that for this final rule, international travel costs to the job initially and from the job at the conclusion
of employment will not be considered to be employer's business expense. Section 212(n) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)),
which contains the LCA requirements, is silent regarding international travel. In &sect;214(c)(5)(A) of the INA
(8 U.S.C. 1184(c)(5)(A)), however, Congress specifically addressed international travel by providing that ``in
the case of an [H&hyph;1B] alien&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;who is dismissed from employment by the employer
before the end of the period of authorized admission, the employer shall be liable for the reasonable costs of return
transportation of the alien abroad.'' The Department has concluded that by making the employer liable for international
travel costs under specific circumstances, and not addressing any other circumstances, Congress intended that
the employer be liable for international travel costs only under the specified circumstances. Of course, this does
not preclude an employer from paying the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's international travel expenses. Further, if the
employer and employee enter into a bona fide, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
voluntary
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 agreement whereby the employer advances monies to cover the employee's cost of international travel subject to recoupment
through wage deductions, such deductions would be allowable provided that the deductions do not exceed the amount
of money advanced by the employer_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, not subject to interest or any other form of surcharge. Such deductions must comply with all other applicable Federal/State
laws.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Prevailing Wage 5% Provision 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(See &sect;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.731(d)(4).) In the Preamble to the Proposed Rule, the Department described its program experience and its concern
regarding apparent confusion as to the Interim Final's provision dealing with what has been called a 5% variable on
the payment of the prevailing wage. The provision in question was incorporated into the H&hyph;1B regulation from
the permanent program regulations at 20 CFR 656.40(a)(2)(i). As explained in the Preamble and set out in the proposed
regulatory language, it is and has been the Department's position, in the H&hyph;1B program, that although an employer
will not be considered to be in violation if found to have paid 95% or more of the prevailing wage, the employer found
to have paid less than 95% will not only be cited for violation but also be assessed back wages based on 100% of the prevailing
wage.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven commenters expressed views regarding the proposed clarification of the regulation. A labor organization
expressed opposition to the Department's toleration of any variable, and suggested that an employer found to have
paid less than 100% should be required ``to pay in full once the error is detected.'' A law firm, stating the concerns
of employers, advocated that no change should be made in this provision. Two government officials (one State, one
Federal) favored the continued application of a 5% variable, although one of these commenters (Federal official)
suggested that no variable should be allowed for users of published wage surveys that are statistically valid. Two
business commenters (computer software corporations) recognized the proposal as a clarification of the Department's
position, and one described the new provision as ``very helpful.'' A member of the general public described the proposed
regulatory language as ``a fair compromise.''

a. Prevailing wage update.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A number of commenters to the proposed rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 5, 1991, and the Interim Final Rule published October 22, 1991, and January 13, 1992, respectively, objected
to the requirement that an employer must obtain prevailing wage information at any time other than when the application
is first filed. These commenters pointed to &sect;212(n)(1)(A)(i) of the INA (as amended by MTINA) which states that
the employer is offering wages that are at least ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;the prevailing wage level&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;based
on the best information available as of the time of filing the application&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;.''
The Department indicated that it recognized that the language could be construed to mean that the prevailing wage
should be determined only once, at the time of filing the application. Further, the Department seriously considered
requiring that the employer determine the prevailing wage only at the time of filing the application, but concluded
that in the case of an application with a 6-year validity period, such procedure would render the prevailing wage requirement
virtually meaningless.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department also considered, alternatively, requiring that the validity period of the labor condition application
be shortened to 1 or 2 years, with an attendant prevailing wage determination every time the application was filed.
The Department decided, in the October 22, 1991, Interim Final Rule, that this approach would be unnecessarily burdensome
and opted instead for what it considered a less burdensome and more sensible approach, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, one application for up to six years but with a prevailing wage determination every two years starting from the date
the labor condition application is certified.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM of October 6, 1993, the Department indicated that, in the context of the proposed reduction in the validity
period from six to three years, the 24-month update would be unduly burdensome on an employer. With a three year application
validity and a 24-month prevailing wage update requirement, an employer could be required to obtain current prevailing
wage information twice in a short time frame: once, 24 months from the filing of the initial application and again upon
the filing of the new application prior to the 3-year deadline. Consequently, in the NPRM the Department proposed
to adopt an 18-month prevailing wage update requirement. In response to the NPRM, the Department received 60 comments
on this issue of which all but five were opposed to the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters' major objections to the NPRM's approach were as follows: the Department does not have the statutory authority
to require any prevailing wage update; the 18-month update proposal is burdensome on employers and will not substantively
increase protections for U.S. workers; the proposal is inconsistent with normal hiring and compensation cycles
which operate on an annual basis; the proposal will place an undue burden on the SESA's; and wages change very little
in an 18-month period (especially in today's economy).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters expressed concern that requiring infrequent prevailing wage updates will allow an employer to use
``stale'' data and will undermine wage protections for U.S. workers. The Department is cognizant of these concerns.
However, the ``actual wage rate'' has been and will continue to be a ``safety net'' for the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant.
Assuming the actual wage is higher than the prevailing wage and thus is the required wage rate, if an employer normally
gives its employees a raise at year's end, or the employer's system provides for other adjustments, H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants
must also be given the raise (consistent with employer-established criteria such as level of performance, attendance,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
etc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful consideration of all the comments received on this issue, the Department has determined that the proposal
suggested by the majority of commenters is the most prudent approach. Under the Final Rule, employers are required
to obtain current prevailing wage information every time a new labor condition application is filed (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, every three years or sooner, if specified).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted by commenters, this requirement will ensure maximum consistency. Unless a lesser period is specified by
the employer, a new labor condition application, prevailing wage update, and I&hyph;129 petition will all be required
at the end of a 3-year period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Documentation of the wage statement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After careful review the Department believes that it is essential to require the employer to maintain documentation
regarding wage rates for all that employer's employees in the specific employment in question at the place of employment.
This information is ordinarily maintained by the employer for purposes of showing compliance with other applicable
statutes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the Fair Labor Standards Act) and will permit the Department to determine whether in fact the required wage has been
paid. Consequently, the language limiting the documentation to individuals with experience and qualifications
similar to the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant has been deleted.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

In addition, the Department has also corrected various technical and typographical errors throughout the rule.
An example of a technical error is the replacement in &sect;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

.715.) As a clarification, the Department is deleting the last sentence in the definition of ``area of intended employment''
which was published in the Interim Final Rule. That sentence which states that ``(i)f there is no MSA then the area of
intended employment is the area with normal commuting distance of the place of employment,'' does not appear in the
definition of ``area of intended employment'' at 20 CFR 656.3 quoted above. Since this concept is already included
in the first sentence of the definition, the sentence in question is being deleted to avoid confusion.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
).) Through administration and enforcement of the program, the Department has become aware of confusion and potential
adverse effects on wages in situations in which employers, in filing their LCA's, rely on SESA prevailing wage determinations
which were obtained on dates considerably in advance of the time of the filing (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, six months prior to LCA date). Data used in prevailing wage rate determinations may be up to four years old. Employers
were obtaining prevailing wage rates and holding them indefinitely before using them in conjunction with filing
an LCA. The Department concluded that a practicable limit should be set on the use of prevailing wage rates. The Department
concludes that 90 days is a reasonable practicable limit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to alleviate confusion and to better assure the achievement of the Congressional purposes of protecting
the wages of U.S. workers, the Department is clarifying the regulation to set a deadline for an employer's reliance
on a SESA prevailing wage determination. An employer that obtains a SESA prevailing wage determination must file
the labor condition application under which that rate will be paid within 90 days from the date of the SESA's determination.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.730(b).) Through administration and enforcement of the program, the Department has become aware that some employers
are filing labor condition applications for periods of anticipated employment which are well in the future (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 one year after the application filing date). This practice poses dangers of abuse and may frustrate Congressional
intent for the protection of the jobs and wages of U.S. workers. The prevailing wage, strike/lockout, and notice obligations
are based, in large part, upon actions taken and conditions which exist at the time the labor condition application
is filed. Therefore, the Department is clarifying the amount of time in advance of the beginning date of the period
of employment that an employer may file a labor condition application. This Final Rule requires that a labor condition
application can be filed no earlier than 6 months before the beginning date of the period of employment. Labor condition
applications which are received by an ETA regional office more than 6 months prior to the beginning date of the period
of employment will be returned to the employer as unacceptable for filing. This procedural change will impose few,
if any, additional burdens on employers and will facilitate the achievement of the statutory purposes.

e. Actual wage
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (See &sect;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.731(a)(1) &amp; Appendix.) As the program has evolved, the Department is aware that inconsistent and perhaps confusing
interpretations have, on occasion, been provided to public inquiries concerning the Department's enforcement
position on the employer's responsibilities under the ``actual wage'' provisions of the statute and regulation.
To rectify any misunderstanding with the regulated community, the Department is providing the following guidance
regarding its enforcement policy concerning the determination of the actual wage under the Final Rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining the required wage rate, the employer must not only obtain the prevailing wage, but also establish the
actual wage for the occupation in which the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is employed by the employer. For purposes of establishing
its compensation system for workers in an occupational category, of course, an employer may take into consideration
objective standards relating to experience, qualifications, education, specific job responsibility and function,
specialized knowledge, and other legitimate business factors. The use of any or all these factors is at the discretion
of the employer. The employer must have and document an objective system used to determine the wages of non-H&hyph;1B
workers, and apply that system to H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants as well. It is not sufficient for the employer simply to
calculate an average wage of all non-H&hyph;1B employees in an occupation; the ``actual wage'' is not an ``average
wage.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The documents explaining the system must be maintained in the public disclosure file. The explanation of the compensation
system must be sufficiently detailed to enable a third party to apply the system to arrive at the actual wage rate computed
by the employer for any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant. The computation of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's individual actual
wage rate shall be documented in the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's personnel file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event the employer has not developed and documented an objective system and/or has not calculated the actual
wage rate for an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant, the Administrator_in determining the actual wage rate for enforcement
and back wage computation purposes_Wage and Hour may need to average the wages of all non-H&hyph;1B workers who are
employed in the same occupation, rather than make determinations for each individual H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant; the
employer in such circumstances would be cited for failure to comply with the requirements for determination of the
actual wage.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Assuming the actual wage is higher than the prevailing wage and thus is the required wage rate, if an employer gives
its employees a raise at year's end, or if the system provides for other adjustments in wages, H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants
must also be given the raise (consistent with legitimate employer-established criteria such as level of performance,
attendance, etc.). This is consistent with Congressional intent that H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants and similarly employed
U.S. workers be provided the same wages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the employer's pay system or scale provides adjustments during the validity period of the labor condition application_

e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
cost-of-living increase or other annual adjustment, increase in the entry-level rate for the occupation due to market
forces, or the employee moves into a more advanced level in the same occupation_the employer shall retain documentation
explaining the changes and clearly showing that, after such adjustments, the wages paid to the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant
are at least the greater of the adjusted actual wage or the prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of intended
employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the Final Rule, guidance for employers regarding the essential aspects of the foregoing discussion, along with
several examples which are substantially the same as appeared in the preamble to the Interim Final Rule are being promulgated
as Appendix A to Subpart H.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.732.) The Act requires employers to attest in their LCA's that the employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants will not
adversely affect the working conditions of U.S. workers similarly employed. The regulation provides that ``working
conditions'' include such matters as working hours, shifts, vacation periods, and fringe benefits. The employer's
obligation in this regard extends for the longer of two periods: The validity period of the certified labor condition
application or the period during which the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) is (are) employed by the employer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In previous stages of H&hyph;1B rulemaking, the Department stated its position that Congress intended prevailing
working condition determinations to be made in the same manner as the current regulations for the permanent alien
labor certification (immigrant worker) program. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

1991); see also 20 CFR part 656. There has been some confusion expressed, however, regarding the Department's interpretation
of this LCA element. While the regulation itself is clear and is not being amended, the Department is providing the
following additional guidance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The H&hyph;1B regulation permits the employer to file an LCA without making any pre-filing determination or documentation
of working conditions; the regulation requires that a prevailing working condition determination be made only in
the event of an investigation. See &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.732 of the final Rule; see also 20 CFR 656.24(b)(3).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public should be aware that the Department is carefully reviewing its program experience, as well as information
received from members of the public and other sources, regarding the impact of the employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants
on the working conditions of U.S. workers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

wage determination. Although DOL regulations provide an avenue for an employer to challenge a SESA determination
through the Employment Service (ES) complaint process (under 20 CFR part 658, subpart E), the Interim Final Rule did
not make it sufficiently clear that challenges to prevailing wage determinations were to be made 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
through that process. In designing the program, the Department had envisioned that the ES complaint process would
be used for all prevailing wage challenges. However, after substantial enforcement litigation experience, the
Department has found that some employers are instead attempting to contest such determinations through the hearing
provided under &sect;

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Final Rule provides needed clarification by directing the employer to the ES complaint process and alerting the
employer that a challenge of a SESA prevailing wage determination may be made only prior to filing an LCA in which that
SESA determination is used. Implicit and essential in this process is the requirement that once an employer obtains
a prevailing wage determination from the SESA and files the LCA without challenging the SESA's determination through
the ES complaint process, the employer, in effect, has accepted the determination and waived its right to challenge
the determination. Permitting an employer to operate under a SESA prevailing wage determination and later contest
it in the course of an investigation or enforcement action is contrary to sound public policy; such a delayed, disruptive
challenge would have a harmful effect on U.S. and H&hyph;1B employees, competing employers, and other parties who
may have received notice of and/or relied on the prevailing wage at issue. Section 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.731(a)(2)(iii)(A) of the Final Rule explicitly states the Department's clarification of the use and consequences
of the ES complaint process. Challenges to SESA prevailing wage determinations are made only through the State agency's
ES process. See 20 CFR 658.410 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the prevailing wage determination is made by the SESA prior to the filing of the LCA, the employer's avenue of
appeal is through the ES complaint system, entering the system at the State level. See 20 CFR 658.410 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. However, where the prevailing wage determination is made by ETA (with or without consultation with the SESA) during
the course of a Wage and Hour Division enforcement action, the employer's avenue of appeal also is through the ES complaint
system, but the employer enters the system at the ETA regional office level. The employer will be notified where to
file any appeal. For purposes of the H&hyph;1B program only, this is a collateral change to the ES complaint system
regulations, which generally require all complaints to be filed at the SESA level (see 20 CFR 658.420 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) and is notwithstanding the provisions of 20 CFR 658.421(a) and 658.426. Similarly, &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.731(d) provides that, where the employer does not have a valid prevailing wage determination, the Administrator,
during the course of an investigation, may obtain a prevailing wage determination from ETA, which, in turn, may consult
with the SESA and then determine the appropriate prevailing wage. Some employers also are contesting these ETA prevailing
wage determinations at the Wage and Hour enforcement hearing provided under &sect;

Administrator (where the employer does not have a valid prevailing wage determination)_is the ES complaint process.
Once the prevailing wage determination is final, either through the lack of a timely challenge or through the completion
of the ES process, the determination shall be conclusive for purpose of enforcement. In such cases where the prevailing
wage determination is made by ETA at the Administrator's request, any challenge must be initiated at the ETA regional
office level within 10 days after the employer receives the ETA prevailing wage determination. Section

time of 10 days, or, after such a challenge, the determination is found to be accurate by the ES complaint process, the
ALJ must accept the determination as accurate and cannot vacate it. As with other final decisions of the Department,
the employer continues to have access to the Federal district court if the issues are not satisfactorily resolved.

.731(c)(5).) The Act requires employers to state that the employer is offering and will offer the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant,
during the period of authorized employment, wages that are at least the required wage rate_the actual wage rate or
the prevailing wage rate, whichever is greater. Furthermore, the employer is required to indicate on the LCA whether
and H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant will work full-time or part-time. Under the Secretary's statutory authority to implement
the Act, the regulations do not authorize an employer to decrease the payment of the required wage rate. In enforcement
proceedings, however, the Department has encountered confusion over the employer's obligations where the H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrant is in a nonproductive status or circumstance. To alleviate such confusion, the following guidance
is provided.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no statutory or regulatory authorization for a reduction in the prescribed wage rate for any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant
who is not engaged in productive work for the LCA-filing employer due to employment related conditions such as training,
lack of work, or other such reasons. The H&hyph;1B program was not intended to provide an avenue for nonimmigrants
to enter the U.S. and await work at the employer's choice or convenience. Compare 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(iii). Instead,
the H&hyph;1B program's purpose is to enable employers to employ fully-qualified workers for whom employment opportunities
currently exist. The employer, having attested to the duration and scope of the intended employment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, beginning and ending dates; full or part-time), has total control of the nonimmigrant's employment status. The
Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(1)) requirements are such that once the H&hyph;1B status has been
approved for the period specified by the employer, the employer controls the status and work of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant,
who is unable to accept employment elsewhere without a certified labor condition application and approved I&hyph;129
petition filed on the worker's behalf by another employer. For the purpose of DOL administration and enforcement
of the H&hyph;1B program pursuant to these regulations, and H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is considered to be under the
control or employ of the LCA-filing employer from the time of arrival in the United States and throughout the period
of his or her employment_regardless of whether the nonimmigrant is in training or other nonproductive status, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
except
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that if during the period of employment an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant experiences a period of nonproductive status due
to conditions which are unrelated to the employment and render the nonimmigrant unable to work_e.g., maternity leave,
automobile accident which temporarily incapacitates the nonimmigrant, caring for an ill relative_then the employer
shall not be obligated to pay the required wage rate during that period, provided that the INS permits the employee
to remain in the U.S. without being paid and provided further that such period is not subject to payment under other
statutes such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (29 U.S.C. 2601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) or the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As clarification, it is the Department's position that the LCA-filing employer has no prerogative_other than in
circumstances described above_but to pay the required wage beginning no later than the day the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant
is in the United States under the control and employ of that LCA-filing employer, and continuing throughout the nonimmigrant's
period of employment. Any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant employed under an LCA in a full-time capacity (the part-time block
not having been checked on Item 7(b) of the LCA) shall be guaranteed full-time pay (ordinarily 40 hours' pay) each week,
or the weekly equivalent if paid a monthly or annual salary. If the employer's LCA shows ``part-time employment,''
the employer will be required to pay the nonproductive employee for at least the number of hours to be worked per week
indicated on the I&hyph;129 petition filed by the employer with the INS. If the employer indicates on the LCA that an
employee is to work only part-time and subsequent investigation discloses that in fact the employee was working full-time
in a majority of the weeks during the period covered by the investigation, the employer will be held responsible for
full-time pay including during nonproductive periods for which the worker received either no pay or less than the
required wage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Through enforcement experience, the Department has become aware that the Interim Final Rule's provision regarding
timeliness of complaints, &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.805(c)(5) (now &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.805(d)(5)), does not give sufficient guidance concerning the implementation of the statutory directive that ``[n]o
investigation or hearing shall be conducted on a complaint concerning *&blank;*&blank;* a failure [to meet a condition
specified in an LCA] or misrepresentation [of material facts in such an application] unless the complaint was filed
not later than 12 months after the date of the failure or misrepresentation, respectively.'' 8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)(A).
The Interim Final Rule states that ``[t]he complaint must be filed no later than 12 months after the date of the alleged
violation(s).'' In enforcement proceedings some employers have argued that this time bar falls on all alleged violations
12 months from the date of the filing of the LCA, which embodies all the employer's obligations and against which any
failure or misrepresentation would be determined. It is the Department's continuing position that the statutory
language, taken in its plain meaning, ties the 12-month time bar to the date of the employer's wrongful action (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
failure to pay the required wage) and not to the date of the LCA. If Congress had intended the LCA date to be controlling,
the statute easily could have been written to so specify. Thus, the Interim Final Rule speaks of ``the date of the alleged
violation(s).'' In order to resolve any possible confusion, the regulation is being clarified. The Final Rule specifies
that ``[t]he complaint must be filed not later than 12 months after the latest date on which the alleged violation(s)
were committed, which would be the date on which the employer allegedly failed to perform an action or fulfill a condition
specified in the LCA, or allegedly took an action or failed to take an action which, through such action or inaction,
demonstrates a misrepresentation of a material fact in the LCA regarding such action or inaction.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department does not consider this statutory provision to be applicable to the scope of available remedies (particularly,
the back wage remedy); Congress dealth with remedies in a separate provision (8 U.S.C. 1182(n)(2)(C)) which neither
contains nor references the 12-month time bar. Thus, neither the Interim Final Rule nor the Final Rule contains a 12-month
limitation regarding the scope of remedies, and the rule has been clarified to expressly so provide.

This regulatory construct creates a situation where the Administrator notifies the AG of a violation upon a finding
of a violation by an ALJ, even though such finding subsequently may be appealed to the Secretary and eventually overturned.
An employer thus could be debarred after a finding of violation by an ALJ, serve part or all of the debarment period,
and subsequently be found by the Secretary not to have committed a violation. To correct this anomaly, &sect;

Secretary declines to review the ALJ's finding; and (c) where, upon review, the Secretary affirms the ALJ's finding.

by the Conference Report (see 56 FR 54723).'' The change in this Final Rule is not substantive in nature, but provides
more detailed guidance in the correct procedure to compute a valid average or arithmetic mean.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.805(a).) In the MTINA amendments to the INA, Congress created different culpability standards for the imposition
of civil money penalties and debarment for the different violations of the statute; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a violation of the working condition and wage elements of the LCA requires ``willfulness,'' while a violation of the
notice element must be ``substantial.'' In the January 13, 1992, Interim Final Rule, which modified the earlier Interim
Final Rule to implement the MTINA amendments, the Department inadvertently erred with regard to the culpability
standards for two types of violations. In &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.805(a), which lists the various violations with their particular culpability standards, the Department omitted
the ``substantial'' failure to specify the number of workers sought, the occupational classification in which the
workers will be employed, and the wage rate and conditions under which they will be employed. This violation has been
added at &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

.805(a)(5), which specifies a ``substantial'' failure to make available for public examination the application
and necessary documents at the employer's place of business or worksite, the Department identified an incorrect
standard of culpability; this provision should have carried a simple failure standard, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

.750(b).) The Interim Final Rule contains a provision at &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.750(b)(3) (57 FR 1332) whereby ETA will promptly notify the Attorney General (AG) of the withdrawal of an employer's
certified labor condition application, unless reasonable cause had been found to commence an investigation. The
purpose of this provision is to alert the AG and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) that the employer's
certified LCA is no longer valid and can not be used to petition for an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant. Based on interagency
discussions between the Department and INS, it has been determined that such notification does not provide a practical
means for INS to adjudicate (and disapprove) any petitions an employer might file based on a certified but subsequently
withdrawn LCA. While such action by an employer (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, filing a petition based on a withdrawn LCA) may be subject to civil or criminal sanction initiated by the INS, the Department
considers it to be essential that the labor protections afforded by the H&hyph;1B LCA provisions not be frustrated
by such action. Therefore, only for the purpose of assuring the labor standards protections afforded under the H&hyph;1B
program, this Final Rule establishes that where an employer files a petition with INS under the H&hyph;1B classification
pursuant to a certified LCA that had been withdrawn by the employer, such petition filing will bind the employer to
all the obligations under the withdrawn LCA effective immediately upon receipt of such petition by INS. This revised
procedure will reduce the paperwork burden on the Department and INS and the Department believes this change will
maintain the worker protections afforded under the H&hyph;1B program. Of course, the employer may always file a new
LCA.

regarding the participation of interested parties who did not file the initial request for hearing but, nonetheless,
desire to participate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While remaining consistent with Congressional intent regarding timely hearings for interested parties, the Department
seeks to better assure orderly and fair proceedings by providing in the Final Rule that, once the deadline for requesting
a hearing has expired, an interested party may participate in an administrative law judge proceeding only with the
approval of the judge.

retaliation against an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant (for accepting back wages, for example) is prohibited activity under
the anti-discrimination provision of the regulation (&sect;

.700(c)(2).) The Interim Final Rule at 58 FR 69226 implemented the provisions of the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) pertaining to the employment of Mexican citizens as professionals. NAFTA established that the employment
of these Mexican citizens is currently subject to the provisions of the H&hyph;1B regulations. Currently Mexican
professionals entering under this classification are limited to 5,500 annually. This limit can be increased by mutual
agreement between the U.S. and Mexico and the numerical limitation will be lifted in 10 years, unless the two countries
decide to eliminate it earlier. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations are clarified to show that the nonimmigrant classification for these individuals (subject to all
of the LCA requirements and enforcement) is ``TN.'' As in the case of nonimmigrants granted the H&hyph;1B classification,
the INS makes all determinations about the occupational sufficiency for the classification.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department believes that this Final Rule is not an ``economically significant regulatory action'' within the
meaning of Executive Order 12866, in that it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely
affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,
public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities. However, the Department has treated
this action as ``significant'' under the President's priorities within the meaning of the principles set forth in
E.O. 12866. This rule follows six previous rulemaking initiatives published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

Final Rule on October 22, 1991; an Interim Final Rule on January 13, 1992; a Proposed Rule published on October 6, 1993;
and an Interim Final Rule on December 30, 1993).

The Department of Labor previously notified the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, and
made the certification pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act at 5 U.S.C. 605(b), that the rule does not have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Procedure for obtaining an H&hyph;1B visa classification. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before a nonimmigrant may be admitted to work in a ``specialty occupation'' or as a fashion model of distinguished
merit and ability in the United States under the H&hyph;1B visa classification, there are certain steps which must
be followed:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) First, an employer shall submit to DOL, and obtain DOL certification of, a labor condition application. The requirements
for obtaining a certified labor condition application are provided in this subpart. The labor condition application
(Form ETA 9035) and instructions may be obtained from DOL Regional Offices listed in &sect;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.720 of this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) After obtaining DOL certification of a labor condition application, the employer may submit a nonimmigrant visa
petition (INS Form I&hyph;129), together with the certified labor condition application, to INS, requesting H&hyph;1B
classification for the foreign worker. The requirements concerning the submission of a petition to, and its processing
by, INS are set forth in INS regulations. The INS petition (Form I&hyph;129) may be obtained from an INS district or
area office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If INS approves the H&hyph;1B classification, the nonimmigrant then may apply for an H&hyph;1B visa abroad at
a consular office of the Department of State, or apply to the INS for a change of visa status if already in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Applicability. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Subparts H and I of this part apply to all employers seeking to employ foreign workers under the H&hyph;1B visa classification
in specialty occupations or as fashion models of distinguished merit and ability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) During the period that the provisions of Appendix 1603.D.4 of Annex 1603 of the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) apply, subparts H and I of this part shall apply to the entry and employment of a nonimmigrant who is a citizen
of Mexico under and pursuant to the provisions of section D or Annex 1603 of NAFTA in the case of all professions set out
in Appendix 1603.D.1 of Annex 1603 of NAFTA other than registered nurses. Therefore, the references in this part to
``H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant'' apply to such nonimmigrants, who are classified by INS as ``TN.'' In the case of a registered
nurse, the provisions of 20 CFR part 655, subparts D and E, and 29 CFR part 504, subparts D and E, shall apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 DOL administers the labor condition application process and enforcement provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The Employment and Training Administration (ETA), DOL, is responsible for receiving and certifying labor condition
applications in accordance with subpart H of this part. ETA is also responsible for compiling and maintaining a list
of labor condition applications and makes such list available for public examination at the Department of Labor,
200 Constitution Avenue, NW., room N4456, Washington, DC 20210.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Employment Standards Administration (ESA), DOL, is responsible, in accordance with subpart I of this part,
for investigating and determining, pursuant to a complaint or otherwise, an employer's misrepresentation in or
failure to comply with labor condition applications or the employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) accepts the employer's petition (INS Form I&hyph;129) with the
DOL-certified labor condition application attached. INS is responsible for approving the nonimmigrant's H&hyph;1B
visa classification. In doing so, the INS determines whether the occupation named in the labor condition application
is a specialty occupation or whether the individual is a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability, and whether
the qualifications of the nonimmigrant meet the statutory requirements for H&hyph;1B visa classification. If the
petition is approved, INS will notify the U.S. Consulate where the nonimmigrant intends to apply for the visa unless
the nonimmigrant is in the U.S. and eligible to adjust status without leaving this country. See 8 U.S.C. 1184(i). The
Department of State, through U.S. Embassies and Consulates, is responsible for issuing H&hyph;1B visas.

Employer's responsibilities.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Each employer seeking an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant in a specialty occupation or as a fashion model of distinguished
merit and ability has several responsibilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The employer shall submit a completed labor condition application on Form ETA 9035 and one copy to the regional
office of ETA serving the area where the nonimmigrant will be employed. If the labor condition application is certified
by ETA, a copy will be returned to the employer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The employer shall make a filed labor condition application and necessary supporting documentation (as identified
under this subpart) available for public examination at the employer's principal place of business in the U.S. or
at the place of employment within one working day after the date on which the labor condition application is filed with
ETA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The employer then may submit a copy of the certified labor condition application to INS with a completed petition
(INS Form I&hyph;129) requesting H&hyph;1B classification.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The employer should not allow the nonimmigrant worker to begin work, even though a labor condition application
has been certified by DOL, until INS grants the worker authorization to work in the United States for that employer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The employer shall develop sufficient documentation to meet its burden of proof with respect to the validity of
the statements made in its labor condition application and the accuracy of information provided in the event that
such statement or information is challenged. The employer shall also maintain such documentation at its principal
place of business in the U.S. and shall make such documentation available to DOL for inspection and copying upon request.

The first labor condition statement: wages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An employer seeking to employ H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants in a specialty occupation or as a fashion model of distinguished
merit and ability shall state on Form ETA 9035 that it will pay the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants the required wage rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Establishing the wage requirement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first labor condition application requirement shall be satisfied when the employer signs Form ETA 9035 attesting
that, for the entire period of authorized employment, the required wage rate will be paid to the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's;
that is, that the wage shall be the greater of: the actual wage rate (as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section)
or the prevailing wage (as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The actual wage is the wage rate paid by the employer to all other individuals with similar experience and qualifications
for the specific employment in question. In determining such wage level, the following factors may be considered:
experience, qualifications, education, job responsibility and function, specialized knowledge, and other legitimate
business factors. ``Legitimate business factors,'' for purposes of this paragraph (a), means those that it is reasonable
to conclude are necessary because they conform to recognized principles or can be demonstrated by accepted rules
and standards. Where there are other employees with substantially similar experience and qualifications in the
specific employment in question_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
they have substantially the same duties and responsibilities as the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant_the actual wage shall
be the amount paid to these other employees. Where no such other employees exist at the place of employment, the actual
wage shall be the wage paid to the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant by the employer. Where the employer's pay system or scale
provides for adjustments during the period of the LCA_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
cost of living increases or other periodic adjustments, higher entry rate due to market conditions, or the employee
moves into a more advanced level in the same occupation_such adjustments shall be provided to similarly employed
H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants (unless the prevailing wage is higher than the actual wage). Examples illustrating these
principles may be found in appendix A to this subpart H.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
prevailing wage 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for the occupational classification in the area of intended employment must be determined as of the time of filing
the application. The employer shall base the prevailing wage on the best information available as of the time of filing
the application. The employer is not required to use any specific methodology to determine the prevailing wage and
may utilize a SESA, an independent authoritative source, or other legitimate sources of wage data. One of the following
sources shall be used to establish the prevailing wage:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) A wage determination for the occupation and area issued under the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 U.S.C. 276a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(see also 29 CFR part 1), or the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act, 41 U.S.C. 351 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(see also 29 CFR part 4) (which shall be available through the SESA);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A union contract which was negotiated at arms-length between a union and the employer, which contains a wage rate
applicable to the occupation; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If the job opportunity is in an occupation which is not covered by paragraph (a)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section,
the prevailing wage shall be the average rate of wages, that is, the rate of wages to be determined, to the extent feasible,
by adding the wages paid to workers similarly employed in the area of intended employment and dividing the total by
the number of such workers. Since it is not always feasible to determine such an average rate of wages with exact precision,
the wage set forth in the application shall be considered as meeting the prevailing wage standard if it is within 5 percent
of the average rate of wages. See paragraph (c) of this section, regarding payment of required wages. See also paragraph
(d)(4) of this section, regarding enforcement. The prevailing wage rate under this paragraph (a)(2)(iii) shall
be based on the best information available. The Department believes that the following prevailing wage sources are,
in order of priority, the most accurate and reliable:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A SESA Determination. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Upon receipt of a written request for a prevailing wage determination, the SESA will determine whether the occupation
is covered by a Davis-Bacon or Service Contract Act wage determination, and, if not, whether it has on file current
prevailing wage information for the occupation.This information will be provided by the SESA to the employer in writing
in a timely manner. Where the prevailing wage is not immediately available, the SESA will conduct a prevailing wage
survey using the methods outlined at 20 CFR 656.40 and other administrative guidelines or regulations issued by ETA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) An employer who chooses to utilize a SESA prevailing wage determination shall file the labor condition application
not more than 90 days after the date of issuance of such SESA wage determination. Once an employer obtains a prevailing
wage determination from the SESA and files an LCA supported by that prevailing wage determination, the employer is
deemed to have accepted the prevailing wage determination (both as to the occupational classification and wage)
and thereafter may not contest the legitimacy of the prevailing wage determination through the Employment Service
complaint system or in an investigation or enforcement action. Prior to filing the LCA, the employer may challenge
a SESA prevailing wage determination through the Employment Service complaint system, by filing a complaint with
the SESA. See 20 CFR 658.410 through 658.426. Employers which challenge a SESA prevailing wage determination must
obtain a final ruling from the Employment Service complaint system prior to filing an LCA based on such determination.
In any challenge, the SESA shall not divulge any employer wage data which was collected under the promise of confidentiality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) If the employer is unable to wait for the SESA to produce the requested prevailing wage determination for the occupation
in question, or for the Employment Service complaint system process to be completed, the employer may rely on other
legitimate sources of available wage information in filing the LCA, as set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) (B) and
(C) of this section. If the employer later discovers, upon receipt of a prevailing wage determination from the SESA,
that the information relied upon produced a wage that was below the prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of
intended employment and the employer was paying below the SESA-determined wage, no wage violation will be found if
the employer retroactively compensates the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) for the difference between the wage paid
and the prevailing wage, within 30 days of the employer's receipt of the SESA determination.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) In all situations where the employer obtains the prevailing wage determination from the SESA, the Department will
accept that prevailing wage determination as correct and will not question its validity where the employer has maintained
a copy of the SESA prevailing wage determination. A complaint alleging inaccuracy of a SESA prevailing wage determination,
in such cases, will not be investigated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
An independent authoritative source. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The employer may use an independent authoritative wage source in lieu of a SESA prevailing wage determination. The
independent authoritative source survey must meet all the criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this
section.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Another legitimate source of wage information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The employer may rely on other legitimate sources of wage data to obtain the prevailing wage. The other legitimate
source survey must meet all the criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. The employer will be required
to demonstrate the legitimacy of the wage in the event of an investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) For purposes of this section, ``similarly employed'' means ``having substantially comparable jobs in the occupational
classification in the area of intended employment,'' except that if no such workers are employed by employers other
than the employer applicant in the area of intended employment, ``similarly employed'' means:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Having jobs requiring a substantially similar level of skills within the area of intended employment; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) If there are no substantially comparable jobs in the area of intended employment, having substantially comparable
jobs with employers outside of the area of intended employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) A prevailing wage determination for labor condition application purposes made pursuant to this section shall
not permit an employer to pay a wage lower than that required under any other applicable Federal, State or local law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) Where a range of wages is paid by the employer to individuals in an occupational classification or among individuals
with similar experience and qualifications for the specific employment in question, a range is considered to meet
the prevailing wage requirement so long as the bottom of the wage range is at least the prevailing wage rate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Once the prevailing wage rate is established, the H&hyph;1B employer than shall compare this wage with the actual
wage rate for the specific employment in question at the place of employment and must pay the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant
at least the higher of the two wages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

adjustments are made in the employer's pay system or scale during the validity period of the LCA, the employer shall
retain documentation explaining the changes and clearly showing that, after such adjustments, the wages paid to

cash in hand, free and clear, when due, except for deductions authorized by paragraph (c)(7) of this section;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,

(5)(i) For the purpose of DOL administration and enforcement of the H&hyph;1B program, an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant
is considered to be under the control or employ of the LCA-filing employer, and therefore shall receive the full wage
which the LCA-filing employer is required to pay, beginning no later than the first day the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant
is in the United States and continuing throughout the nonimmigrant's period of employment. Therefore if the H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrant is in a nonproductive status for reasons such as training, lack of license, lack of assigned work or any
other reason, the employer will be required to pay the salaried employee the full pro-rata amount due, or to pay the
hourly-wage employee for a full-time week (40 hours or such other number of hours as the employer can demonstrate to
be full-time employment for the occupation and area involved) at the required wage for the occupation listed on the
LCA. If the employer's LCA carries a designation of ``part-time employment,'' the employer will be required to pay
the nonproductive employee for at least the number of hours indicated on the I&hyph;129 petition filed by the employer
with the INS. If during a subsequent enforcement action by the Administrator it is determined that an employee designated
in the LCA as part-time was in fact working full-time or regularly working more hours than reflected on the I&hyph;129
petition, the employer will be held to the factual standard disclosed by the enforcement action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If, however, during the period of employment, an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant experiences a period of nonproductive
status due to conditions unrelated to employment which render the nonimmigrant unable to work_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
maternity leave, automobile accident which temporarily incapacitates the nonimmigrant, caring for an ill relative_then
the employer shall not be obligated to pay the required wage rate during that period 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
provided that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the INS permits the employee to remain in the U.S. without being paid and provided further that such period is not subject
to payment under other statutes such as the Family and Medical Leave Act (29 U.S.C. 2601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) If the employee works in an occupation other than that identified on the employer's LCA, the employer's required
wage obligation is based on the occupation identified on the LCA, and not on whatever wage standards may be applicable
in the occupation in which the employee may be working.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
(ii) Deduction which is authorized by a collective bargaining agreement, or is reasonable and customary in the occupation
and/or area of employment (e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
union dues; contribution to premium for health insurance policy covering all employees; savings or retirement fund

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
except that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the deduction may not recoup a business expense(s) of the employer; the deduction must have been revealed to the worker
prior to the commencement of employment and, if the deduction was a condition of employment, had been clearly identified
as such; and the deduction must be made against wages of U.S. workers as well as H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants (where there
are U.S. workers); 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Deduction which meets the following requirements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Is made in accordance with a voluntary, written authorization by the employee (Note: an employee's mere acceptance
of a job which carries a deduction as a condition of employment does not constitute voluntary authorization, even
if such condition were stated in writing);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Is for a matter principally for the benefit of the employee (Note: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
housing and food allowances would be considered to meet this ``benefit of employee'' standard, unless the employee
is in travel/per diem status, or unless the circumstances indicate that the arrangements for the employee's housing
or food are principally for the convenience or benefit of the employer (

e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
employee living at worksite in ``on call'' status));
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Is not a recoupment of the employer's business expense (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tools and equipment; transportation costs where such transportation is an incident of and necessary to the employment;
living expenses when the employee is traveling on the employer's business) (for purposes of this section, initial
transportation from and end-of-employment travel to the worker's home country shall not be considered a business
expense);
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(D) Is an amount that does not exceed the fair market value or the actual cost (whichever is lower) of the matter covered
(Note: the employer must document the cost and value); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(E) Is an amount that does not exceed the limits set for garnishment of wages in the Consumer Credit Protection Act,
15 U.S.C. 1673, and the regulations of the Secretary pursuant to that Act, 29 CFR part 870, under which garnishment(s)
may not exceed 25% of an employee's disposable earnings for a workweek.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Any unauthorized deduction taken from wages is considered by the Department to be non-payment of that amount of
wages, and, in the event of an investigation, will result in back wage assessment (plus civil money penalties and/or
disqualification from H&hyph;1B and other immigration programs (pursuant to &sect;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Where the employer depresses the employee's wages below the required wage by imposing on the employee any of the
employer's business expense(s), the Department will consider the amount to be an unauthorized deduction from wages
even if the matter is not shown in the employer's payroll records as a deduction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Where the employer makes deduction(s) for repayment of loan(s) or wage advance(s) made to the employee, the Department,
in the event of an investigation, will require the employer to establish the legitimacy and purpose(s) of the loan(s)
or wage advance(s), with reference to the standards set out in paragraph (c)(7) of this section.

wage'' condition or a material misrepresentation by the employer regarding the payment of the required wage, or pursuant
to such other basis for investigation as the Administrator may find, the Administrator shall determine whether the
employer has the documentation required in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, and whether the documentation supports
the employer's wage attestation. Where the documentation is either nonexistent or is insufficient to determine
the prevailing wage (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,

or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
where, based on significant evidence regarding wages paid for the occupation in the area of intended employment,
the Administrator has reason to believe that the prevailing wage finding obtained from an independent authoritative
source or another legitimate source varies substantially from the wage prevailing for the occupation in the area
of intended employment; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
where the employer has been unable to demonstrate that the prevailing wage determined by another legitimate source
is in accordance with the regulatory criteria, the Administrator may contact ETA, which shall provide the Administrator
with a prevailing wage determination, which the Administrator shall use as the basis for determining violations
and for computing back wages, if such wages are found to be owed. The 30-day investigatory period shall be suspended
while ETA makes the prevailing wage determination and, in the event that the employer timely challenges the determination
through the Employment service complaint system (see &sect;

(2) In the event the Administrator obtains a prevailing wage from ETA pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section,
the employer may challenge the ETA prevailing wage only through the Employment Service complaint system. See 20 CFR
part 658, subpart E. Notwithstanding the provisions of 20 CFR 658.421 and 658.426, the appeal shall be initiated at
the ETA regional office level. Such challenge shall be initiated within 10 days after the employer receives ETA's
prevailing wage determination from the Administrator. In any challenge to the wage determination, neither ETA nor
the SESA shall divulge any employer wage data which was collected under the promise of confidentiality.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Where the employer timely challenges an ETA prevailing wage determination obtained by the Administrator, the
30-day investigative period shall be suspended until the employer obtains a final ruling from the Employment Service
complaint system. Upon such final ruling, the investigation and any subsequent enforcement proceeding shall continue,
with ETA's prevailing wage determination serving as the conclusive determination for all purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where the employer does not challenge ETA's prevailing wage determination obtained by the Administrator, such
determination shall be deemed to have been accepted by the employer as accurate and appropriate (both as to the occupational
classification and wage) and thereafter shall not be subject to challenge in a hearing pursuant to &sect;

applicable under the circumstances of the particular complaint.

(4) No prevailing wage violation will be found if the employer paid a wage that is equal to or more than 95 percent of the
prevailing wage as required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. If the employer paid a wage that is less than
95 percent of the prevailing wage, the employer will be required to pay 100 percent of the prevailing wage.

An employer seeking to employ H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants in specialty occupations or as fashion models of distinguished
merit and ability shall state on Form ETA 9035 that the employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants will not adversely affect
the working conditions of workers similarly employed in the area of intended employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) For purposes of this section, ``similarly employed'' shall mean ``having substantially comparable jobs in the
occupational classification at the worksite and in the area of intended employment.'' If no such workers are employed
at the worksite or by employers other than the employer applicant in the area of intended employment ``similarly employed''
shall mean:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Having jobs requiring a substantially similar level of skills at the worksite or within the area of intended employment;
or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The second labor condition application requirement shall be satisfied when the employer signs the labor condition
application attesting that for the period of intended employment its employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants will
not adversely affect the working conditions of workers similarly employed. Working conditions encompass matters
including hours, shifts, vacation periods, and fringe benefits. The employer's obligation regarding working conditions
shall extend for the longer of two periods: the validity period of the certified LCA or the period during which the H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrant(s) is(are) employed by the employer.

(1) In the event an enforcement action is initiated pursuant to subpart I of this part, the employer shall document
the validity of its prevailing working conditions statement referenced in paragraph (b) of this section and attested
to on Form ETA 9035. The employer must be able to show that the working conditions of similarly employed workers were
not adversely affected by the employment of an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant_e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
that the working conditions are similar to working conditions which preceded the employment of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant,
or, if there are no similarly employed workers working for the employer, are similar to those existing in like business
establishments to the employer's in the area of employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the event that an investigation is conducted pursuant to subpart I of this part concerning whether the employer
failed to satisfy the prevailing working conditions statement referenced in paragraph (b) of this section and attested
to on Form ETA 9035, the Administrator shall determine whether the employer has produced the documentation required
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and whether the documentation is sufficient to support the employer's prevailing
working conditions statement. If the employer fails to produce any documentation to support its burden of proof demonstrating
that there is no adverse effect on the working conditions of workers similarly employed, the Administrator shall
find a violation of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Examples of documentation which employers should either maintain
or produce include any relevant information which discusses the working conditions for the industry, occupation
and locale, such as published studies, surveys, or articles and documentation regarding working conditions at the
worksite, such as fringe benefit packages, which pre-existed the employment of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant. If the
documentation is insufficient to determine whether the employment of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants has or has not adversely
affected the working conditions of workers similarly employed in the area of employment, the Administrator may contact
ETA, which shall provide the Administrator with advice regarding the working conditions of similarly employed workers
in the area of employment.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An employer seeking to employ H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants shall state on Form ETA 9035 that the employer has provided
notice of the filing of the labor condition application to the bargaining representative of the employer's employees
in the occupational classification in which the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants will be employed or are intended to be employed
in the area of intended employment, or, if there is no such bargaining representative, has posted notice of filing
in conspicuous locations in the employer's establishment(s) in the area of intended employment, in the manner described
in this section.

The fourth labor condition application requirement shall be established when the conditions of paragraphs (a)(1)
and (a)(2) of this section are met.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1)(i) Where there is a collective bargaining representative for the occupational classification in which the H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrants will be employed, on or within 30 days before the date the labor condition application is filed with
ETA, the employer shall provide notice to the bargaining representative that a labor condition application is being,
or will be, filed with ETA. The notice shall identify the number of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants the employer is seeking
to employ; the occupational classification in which the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants will be employed; the wages offered;
the period of employment; and the location(s) at which the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants will be employed. Notice under
this paragraph (a)(1)(i) shall include the following statement: ``Complaints alleging misrepresentation of material
facts in the labor condition application and/or failure to comply with the terms of the labor condition application
may be filed with any office of the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Where there is no collective bargaining representative, the employer shall, on or within 30 days before the date
the labor condition application is filed with ETA, provide a notice of the filing of the labor condition application
to its employees by posting a notice in at least two conspicuous locations at each place of employment where any H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrant will be employed. The notice shall indicate that H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants are sought; the number of
such nonimmigrants the employer is seeking; the occupational classification; the wages offered; the period of employment;
the location(s) at which the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants will be employed; and that the labor condition application
is available for public inspection at the employer's principal place of business in the U.S. or at the worksite. The
notice shall also include the statement: ``Complaints alleging misrepresentation of material facts in the labor
condition application and/or failure to comply with the terms of the labor condition application may be filed with
any office of the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor.'' The posting of exact copies of the
labor condition application shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph (a)(1)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The notice shall be of sufficient size and visibility, and shall be posted in two or more conspicuous places so that
the employer's workers at the place(s) of employment can easily see and read the posted notice(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Appropriate locations for posting the notices include, but are not limited to, locations in the immediate proximity
of wage and hour notices required by 29 CFR 516.4 or occupational safety and health notices required by 29 CFR 1903.2(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(D) Where the employer places any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at one or more worksites not contemplated at the time
of filing the application, but which are within the area of intended employment listed on the LCA, the employer is required
to post notice(s) at such worksite(s) on or before the date any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant begins work, which notice shall
remain posted for a total of ten days.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The employer shall, no later than the date the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant reports to work at the place of employment,
provide the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant with a copy of the labor condition application certified by the Department.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Subject to the conditions specified in paragraph (b) of this section, an employer may place H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s)
at worksite(s) (place(s) of employment) within areas of employment not listed on the employer's labor condition
application(s)_whether or not the employer owns or controls such worksite(s)_without filing new labor condition
application(s) for the area(s) of intended employment which would encompass such worksite(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The following restrictions shall be fully satisfied by an employer which places H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at
worksite(s) (place(s) of employment) within areas of employment not listed on the employer's labor condition application(s):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

.734 of this part with regard to worksite(s) located within the area(s) of intended employment listed on the employer's
labor condition application(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The employer shall not place, assign, lease, or otherwise contract out any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) to any worksite
where there is a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute in the same occupational classification(s) as the
H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For every day of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's(s') placement outside the LCA-listed area of employment, the employer
shall pay such worker(s) the required wage (based on the prevailing wage at such worker's(s) permanent work site,
or the employer's actual wage, whichever is higher) plus per diem and transportation expenses (for both workdays
and non-workdays) at rate(s) no lower than the rate(s) prescribed for Federal Government employees on travel or temporary
assignment, as set out in 41 CFR Part 301&hyph;7 and Ch. 301, App. A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The employer's placement(s) of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at any worksite(s) in an area of employment not listed
on the employer's labor condition application(s) shall be limited to a cumulative total of ninety workdays within
a three-year period, beginning on the first day on which the employer placed an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant at any worksite
within such area of employment. For purposes of this section, ``workday'' shall mean any day on which one or more H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrants perform any work at any worksite(s) within the area of employment. For example, one ``workday'' would
be counted for a day on which seven H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants worked at three worksites within one city, and one ``workday''
would be counted for a day on which one H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant worked at one worksite within a city. The employer may
rotate such workers into worksites within such area of employment or may maintain a constant work force. However,
on the first day after the accumulation of 90 workdays, the employer shall not have any such H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s)
at any worksite(s) within such area of employment not included on a certified LCA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) At the accumulation of the 90 workdays described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the employer shall have ended
its placement of all H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) at any worksite(s) within the area of employment not listed on the
labor condition application, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
shall have filed and received a certified labor condition application for the area(s) of intended employment encompassing
such worksite(s) and performed all actions required in connection with such filing(s) (

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) At any time during the 90-day period described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the employer may file a labor
condition application for the area of intended employment encompassing such worksite(s), performing all actions
required in connection with such labor condition application. Upon certification of such LCA, the employer's obligation
to pay Federal per diem rates to the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant(s) shall terminate. (However,

of the employer or its authorized agent or representative, the regional Certifying Officer shall certify the labor
condition application unless it falls within one of the categories set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
The Certifying Officer shall make a determination to certify or not certify the labor condition application within
7 working days of the date the application is received and date-stamped by the Department. If the labor condition application
is certified, the regional Certifying Officer shall return a certified copy of the labor condition application to
the employer or the employer's authorized agent or representative. The employer shall file the certified labor condition
application with the appropriate INS office in the manner prescribed by INS. The INS shall determine whether each
occupational classification named in the certified labor condition application is a specialty occupation or is
a fashion model of distinguished merit and ability.

 ETA shall not certify a labor condition application and shall return such application to the employer or the employer's
authorized agent or representative, when either or both of the following two conditions exists:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) When the Form ETA 9035 is not properly completed. Examples of a Form ETA 9035 which is not properly completed include
instances where the employer has failed to check all the necessary boxes; or where the employer has failed to state
the occupational classification, number of nonimmigrants sought, wage rate, period of intended employment, place
of intended employment, or prevailing wage and its source; or where the application does not contain the signature
of the employer or the employer's authorized agent or representative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) When the Form ETA ETA 9035 contains obvious inaccuracies. An obvious inaccuracy will be found if the employer
files an application in error_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 where the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, after notice and opportunity for a hearing pursuant to subpart I
of this part, has notified ETA in writing that the employer has been disqualified from employing H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants
under section 212(n)(2) of the INA. Examples of other obvious inaccuracies include stating a wage rate below the FLSA
minimum wage, submitting a labor condition application earlier than six months before the beginning date of the period
of intended employment, identifying multiple occupations on a single labor condition application, identifying
places of employment within the jurisdiction of more than one ETA regional office on a single labor condition application,
identifying a wage which is below the prevailing wage listed on the LCA, or identifying a wage range where the bottom
of such wage range is lower than the prevailing wage listed on the LCA.

 If the labor condition application is not certified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) (i) or (ii) of this section, ETA shall
return it to the employer, or the employer's authorized agent or representative, explaining the reasons for such
return without certification. The employer may immediately submit a corrected application to ETA. A ``resubmitted''
or ``corrected'' labor condition application shall be treated as a new application by the regional office (

except that

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 if the labor condition application is not certified pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section because of notification
by the Administrator of the employer's disqualification, such action shall be the final decision of the Secretary

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Appendix A to Subpart H_Guidance for Determination of the ``Actual Wage''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining the required wage rate, in addition to obtaining the prevailing wage, the employer must establish
the actual wage for the occupation in which the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant is employed by the employer. For purposes of
establishing its compensation system for workers in an occupational category, an employer may take into consideration
objective standards relating to experience, qualifications, education, specific job responsibility and function,
specialized knowledge, and other legitimate business factors. The use of any or all these factors is at the discretion
of the employer. The employer must have and document an objective system used to determine the wages of non&hyph;H&hyph;1B
workers, and apply that system to H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants as well. It is not sufficient for the employer simply to
calculate an average wage of all non&hyph;H&hyph;1B employees in an occupation; the actual wage is not an ``average
wage''.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The documents explaining the system must be maintained in the public disclosure file. The explanation of the compensation
system must be sufficiently detailed to enable a third party to apply the system to arrive at the actual wage rate computed
by the employer for any H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant. The computation of the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's individual actual
wage rate must be documented in the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant's personnel file.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assuming the actual wage is higher than the prevailing wage and thus is the required wage rate, if an employer gives
its employees a raise at year's end or if the system provides for other adjustments in wages, H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants
must also be given the raise (consistent with legitimate employer-established criteria such as level of performance,
attendance, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
etc.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
). This is consistent with Congressional intent that H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants and similarly employed U.S. workers
be provided the same wages.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the employer's pay system or scale provides adjustments during the validity period of the LCA_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 cost-of-living increase or other annual adjustments, increase in the entry-level rate for the occupation due to
market forces, or the employee moves into a more advanced level in the same occupation_the employer shall retain documentation
explaining the changes and clearly showing that, after such adjustments, the wages paid to the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant
are at least the greater of the adjusted actual wage or the prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of intended
employment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following examples illustrate these principles:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Worker A is paid $10.00 per hour and supervises two employees. Worker B, who is similarly qualified and performs
substantially the same job duties except for supervising other employees, is paid $8.00 per hour because he/she has
no supervisory responsibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The compensation differential is acceptable because it is based upon a relevant distinction in job duties, responsibilities,
and functions: The difference in the supervisory responsibilities of the two employees. The actual wage in this occupation
at the worksite for workers with supervisory responsibility is $10.00 per hour; the actual wage in this occupation
at the worksite for workers without supervisory responsibility is $8.00 per hour.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Systems Analyst A has experience with a particular software which the employer is interested in purchasing, of
which none of the employer's current employees have knowledge. The employer buys the software and hires Systems Analyst
A on an H&hyph;1B visa to train the other employees in its application. The employer pays Systems Analyst A more than
its other Systems Analysts who are otherwise similarly qualified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The compensation differential is acceptable because of the distinction in the specialized knowledge and the job
duties of the employees. Systems Analyst A, in addition to the qualifications and duties normally associated with
this occupation at the employer's worksite, is also specially knowledgeable and responsible for training the employer's
other Systems Analysts in a new software package. As a result, Systems Analyst A commands a higher actual wage. However,
if the employer employs other similarly qualified systems analysts who also have unique knowledge and perform similar
duties in training other analysts in their area of expertise, the actual wage for Systems Analyst A would have to be
at least equivalent to the actual wage paid to such similarly employed analysts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) An employer seeks a scientist to conduct AIDS research in the employer's laboratory. Research Assistants A (a
U.S. worker) and B (an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant) both hold Ph.D's in the requisite field(s) of study and have the same
number of years of experience in AIDS research. However, Research Assistant A's experience is on the cutting edge
of a breakthrough in the field and his/her work history is distinguished by frequent praise and recognition in writing
and through awards. Research Assistant B (the nonimmigrant) has a respectable work history but has not conducted
research which has been internationally recognized. Employer pays Research Assistant A $10,000 per year more than
Research Assistant B in recognition of his/her unparalleled expertise and accomplishments. The employer now wants
to hire a third Research Assistant on an H&hyph;1B visa to participate in the work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The differential between the salary paid Research Assistant A (the U.S. worker) and Research Assistant B (an H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrant) is acceptable because it is based upon the specialized knowledge, expertise and experience of Research
Assistant A, demonstrated in writing. The employer is not required to pay Research Assistant B the same wage rate as
that paid Research Assistant A, even though they may have the same job titles. The actual wage required for the third
Research Assistant, to be hired on an H&hyph;1B visa, would be the wage paid to Research Assistant B unless he/she has
internationally recognized expertise similar to that of Research Assistant A. As set out in &sect;

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.731(1)(A) the employer must have and document the system used in determining the actual wage of H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants.
The explanation of the system must be such that a third party may use the system to arrive at the actual wage paid the H&hyph;1B
nonimmigrant.

(4) Employer located in City X seeks experienced mechanical engineers. In City X, the prevailing wage for such engineers
is $49,500 annually. In setting the salaries of U.S. workers, employer pays its nonsupervisory mechanical engineers
with 5 to 10 years of experience between $50,000 and $75,000 per year, using defined pay scale ``steps'' tied to experience.
Employer hires engineers A, B, and C, who each have five years of experience and similar qualifications and will perform
substantially the same nonsupervisory job duties. Engineer A is from Japan, where he/she earns the equivalent of
$80,000 per year. Engineer B is from France and had been earning the equivalent of $50,000 per year. Engineer C is from
India and had been earning the equivalent of $20,000 per year. Employer pays Engineer A $80,000 per year, Engineer
B $50,000, and Engineer C $20,000 as the employer has had a long-established system of maintaining the home-country
pay levels of temporary foreign workers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The INA requires that the employer pay the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant at least the actual wage or the prevailing wage,
whichever is greater, but there is no prohibition against paying an H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant a greater wage. Therefore,
Engineer A may lawfully be paid the $80,000 per year. Engineer B's salary of $50,000 is acceptable, since this is the
employer's actual wage for an engineer with Engineer B's experience and duties. Engineer C's salary, however, at
a rate of $20,000 per year, is unacceptable under the law, even given the employer's ``long-established `home country'
system,'' since $20,000 would be below both the actual wage and the prevailing wage. The latter situation is an example
of an illegitimate business factor, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a system to maintain salary parity with peers in the country of origin, which yields a wage below the required wage levels.

(d) Any aggrieved person or organization (including bargaining representatives and governmental officials) may

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) No particular form of complaint is required, except that the complaint shall be written or, if oral, shall be reduced
to writing by the Wage and Hour Division official who receives the complaint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The complaint shall set forth sufficient facts for the Administrator to determine whether an investigation is
warranted, in that there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation as described in paragraph (a) of this section
has been committed. This determination shall be made within 10 days of the date that the complaint is received by a Wage
and Hour Division official. If the Administrator determines that the complaint fails to present reasonable cause
for an investigation, the Administrator shall so notify the complainant, who may submit a new complaint, with such
additional information as may be necessary. No hearing pursuant to this subpart shall be available where the Administrator
determines that an investigation on a complaint is not warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

the wage determination through the Employment Service complaint system, to the date of the completion of such complaint
process) or advice as to prevailing working conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) A complaint must be filed not later than 12 months after the latest date on which the alleged violation(s) were committed,
which would be the date on which the employer allegedly failed to perform an action or fulfill a condition specified
in the LCA, or allegedly took an action which, through such action or inaction, demonstrates a misrepresentation
of a material fact in the LCA regarding such action or inaction. This jurisdictional bar does not affect the scope of
the remedies which may be assessed by the Administrator. Where, for example, a complaint is timely filed, back wages
may be assessed for a period prior to one year before the filing of a complaint.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Within 60 calendar days after the date of the hearing, the administrative law judge shall issue a decision. If any

XXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

unless and until the Secretary issues an order affirming the decision, or, unless and until 30 calendar days have passed
after the Secretary's receipt of the petition for review and the Secretary has not issued notice to the parties that
the Secretary will review the administrative law judge's decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The decision of the administrative law judge shall include a statement of findings and conclusions, with reasons
and basis therefor, upon each material issue presented on the record. The decision shall also include an appropriate
order which may affirm, deny, reverse, or modify, in whole or in part, the determination of the Administrator; the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

.731(d) of this part), the administrative law judge shall remand the matter to the Administrator for further proceedings
on the issue(s) of the existence of wage violation(s) and/or the amount(s) of back wages owed. If there is no such determination
and remand by the administrative law judge, the administrative law judge shall accept such wage determination as
accurate. Such wage determination is one made by ETA, from which the employer did not file a timely complaint through
the Employment Service complaint system or from which the employer has appealed through the ES complaint system and
a final decision therein has been issued. See &sect;

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
An analysis of lodging and meal cost survey data reveals that the listing of maximum per diem rates for locations within
the continental United States (CONUS) should be updated to provide for the reimbursement of Federal employees' expenses
covered by per diem. This final rule, among other things, increases/decreases the maximum lodging and meals and incidental
expenses amounts in certain existing per diem localities, adds new per diem localities, and modifies the defined
per diem area for Flagstaff and Grand Canyon, in the state of Arizona and Virginia Beach and Williamsburg, in the state
of Virginia.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Services Administration (GSA) has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for
the purposes of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993. This final rule is not required to be published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
for notice and comment. Therefore, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons set out in the preamble, under 5 U.S.C. 5701&hyph;5709, title 41, chapter 301 of the Code of Federal
Regulations is amended by revising Appendix A to chapter 301 to read as follows:

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric
Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/-50 series turbofan engines. This proposal would require a reduction of the low cycle fatigue
(LCF) retirement lives for certain high pressure turbine rotor (HPTR) stage 2 disks, and would provide a drawdown
schedule for those affected parts with reduced LCF retirement lives. This proposal is prompted by the results of a
refined life analysis performed by the manufacturer which revealed minimum calculated LCF lives significantly
lower than published LCF retirement lives. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent a LCF failure
of the HPTR stage 2 disk, which could result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed airworthiness directive (AD) is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;45/-50 series
turbofan engines. A study performed by the manufacturer using updated life analyses for the high pressure turbine
rotor (HPTR) stage 2 disk has revealed minimum calculated low cycle fatigue (LCF) lives which are significantly lower
than published LCF retirement lives. This condition, if not corrected, could result in a LCF failure of the HPTR stage
2 disk, which could result in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;1069,
dated September 12, 1994, that describes a reduction in the published LCF retirement lives for affected HPTR stage
2 disks, and an FAA-approved rework procedure for the affected disks to increase the FAA-approved LCF retirement
life to 8,750 or 9,700 cycles since new (CSN), depending on the CSN of the disk when the rework is performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other engines of this same type design,
the proposed AD would require a reduction of the published LCF retirement lives for certain HPTR stage 2 disks, and
would provide a drawdown schedule for those affected disks with reduced LCF retirement lives. If the FAA-approved
rework is accomplished, the LCF retirement life may be increased to 8,750 or 9,700 cycles, depending on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSN of the disk when the rework is performed. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the
service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 280 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that
it would take approximately 194 work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor
rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $16,383 per engine. Based on these figures, the
total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $7,574,840. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

To prevent a low cycle fatigue (LCF) failure of the high pressure turbine rotor (HPTR) stage 2 disk, which could result
in an uncontained engine failure and damage to the aircraft, accomplish the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Remove from service HPTR stage 2 disks Part Numbers (P/N) 1474M49P04, 1474M49P05, 1474M49P06, 9045M35P15, 9045M35P17,
and 9045M35P18, in accordance with the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) For disks that have accumulated less than 3,500 cycles since new (CSN) on the effective date of this airworthiness
directive (AD), remove disk from service prior to accumulating 7,080 CSN. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) For disks that have accumulated 3,500 CSN or more, but less than 7,080 CSN on the effective date of this AD, remove
disk from service prior to accumulating 7,080 CSN, or prior to accumulating 3,100 cycles in service (CIS) after the
effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, but not to exceed 9,700 CSN. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) For disks which have accumulated 7,080 CSN or more on the effective date of this AD, remove disk from service at the
next piece-part exposure, but not to exceed 9,700 CSN. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Remove from service HPTR stage 2 disks P/N 9264M58P01, 9264M58P02, and 9264M58P03 prior to accumulating 7,080
CSN. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) This AD establishes the following new LCF retirement lives which will be published in Chapter 5 of the CF6&hyph;50
Engine Task Numbered Shop Manual, GEK 50481: 7,080 cycles for HPTR stage 2 disk P/N 1474M49P04, 1474M49P05, 1474M49P06,

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Fokker Model F28
Mark 0100 series airplanes. This proposal would require an inspection to detect the presence of a drain hole in certain
mounting frames of the auxiliary power unit (APU). If a drain hole is present, the proposed AD would also require an
inspection to detect corrosion of the mounting frame, and eventual replacement of the mounting frame. This proposal
is prompted by a report indicating that corrosion was found on a number of mounting frames of the APU. The actions specified
by the proposed AD are intended to prevent such corrosion, which could render the APU inoperative and may lead to a potential
fire hazard.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Rijksluchtvaartdienst (RLD), which is the airworthiness authority for the Netherlands, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on all Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. The RLD advises that corrosion
has been found on a number of mounting frames, having part number (P/N) D67050&hyph;407, of the auxiliary power unit
(APU). Investigation revealed that the existing design of the drain hole in frame member M allows the accumulation
of moisture and corrosion on the mounting frame of the APU. Such corrosion could render the APU inoperative and may
lead to a potential fire hazard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fokker has issued Service Bulletin SBF100&hyph;49&hyph;022, dated August 27, 1992, which describes procedures
for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Performing a one-time detailed visual inspection to detect the presence of a drain hole in frame member M of the mounting
frames, having part number (P/N) D67050&hyph;407, of the APU; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If a drain hole is present, performing a detailed visual inspection to detect corrosion on the mounting frame of
the APU; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Replacing the mounting frame with a new mounting frame. The RLD classified this service bulletin as mandatory and
issued Netherlands airworthiness directive (BLA) 92&hyph;103, dated October 5, 1992, in order to assure the continued
airworthiness of these airplanes in the Netherlands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the Netherlands and is type certificated for operation in the United States
under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral
airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the RLD has kept the FAA informed
of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the RLD, reviewed all available information,
and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in
the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a one-time visual inspection to detect the presence
of a drain hole in frame member M of certain mounting frames of the APU. If a drain hole is present, the proposed AD would
also require an inspection to detect corrosion of the mounting frame; and eventual replacement of the mounting frame
with a new mounting frame. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin
described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 119 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
13 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $92,820, or $780
per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes. This proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require installation of modified engine de-ice timers, modification of the electrical wiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the duct heat of the engine air intake, and installation of a time delay for the de-ice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system in the air intake duct of the right engine. This proposal would also require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated revisions to the Airplane Flight Manual. This proposal is prompted by reports 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ice that accreted in the engine air intake ducts and was ingested into the engine; this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulted in engine power rollback (loss of engine power). The actions specified by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of multiple engine power during flight in icing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom, recently notified
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on certain Jetstream Model ATP airplanes. The CAA advises that probable
ingestion of accreted ice, shed from the inner surfaces of the engine air intake ducts, has resulted in engine power
rollbacks (loss of engine power) during flight in icing conditions. Five reports have been received: three reports
of power rollback on two engines simultaneously, and two reports of power rollback on one engine. Ingestion of accreted
ice, if not prevented, could result in multiple engine power rollback during flight in freezing precipitation conditions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;30&hyph;39&hyph;30146A (Modification 30146A), dated July 29,
1994, which describes procedures for installing modified de-ice timers for the left and right engines. The modified
de-ice timers will provide additional electric power directly to the engine air intake flange heater. This additional
electric load requires revision of electric load shedding procedures in the event of electrical system failure.
These procedures are included in the Jetstream Aircraft ATP Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), Temporary Revision T/41,
Issue 1, dated November 15, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has also issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;30&hyph;37&hyph;30143A (Modification 30143A), dated August
1, 1994, and Revision 1, dated September 5, 1994, which describe procedures for installation of modified electrical
wiring for flexible ducts and lips of the engine air intake. This modification automates turning on the de-ice heaters
in the flexible duct of the engine air intake when the lip heat is on. The modification continues to allow pilots to select
the de-ice systems of the engine air intake manually, via the ``All On'' switch of the anti-ice system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CAA classified these service bulletins as mandatory, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these
airplanes in the United Kingdom. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jetstream has also issued Service Bulletin ATP&hyph;30&hyph;30&hyph;35285A, dated July 15, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, which describes procedures for installation of a system that automates a 20-second delay between the time that
the left engine intake de-ice systems are turned on and the time that the right engine intake de-ice systems are turned
on. This modification also reduces pilot workload by automatically turning on the engine de-ice system at an interval
20 seconds apart for the left and right engines when the engine intake de-ice is selected to ``on.'' The automated 20-second
time delay ensures that the de-ice system for the left and right engine intakes will be turned on in such a way as to prevent
simultaneous rollbacks of the engines in icing conditions. The CAA has not classified this service bulletin as mandatory.
However, the FAA has determined that the pilot could easily neglect to heed the necessary 20-second delay if manually
turning on the second flexible duct de-ice system; this could cause accumulated ice in the air intake ducts of both
engines to dislodge simultaneously and be ingested into the engines, which then could result in rollback of both engines
at the same time. In light of this, the FAA considers that the modification described in this service bulletin is necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations
(14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness
agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of
the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type
design that are certificated for operation in the United States.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type
design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require installation of new de-ice timers and an associated
revision to the AFM; installation of a system that automates a 20-second delay between turning on the left engine intake
de-ice system and turning on the right engine intake de-ice system; and installation of modified electrical wiring
for the flexible ducts and lips of the engine air intake. These actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance
with the service bulletins described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, the FAA has learned that,
in general, some operators may misunderstand the legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability
provision of the AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA points out that all
airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally subject to the AD. If an airplane has been
altered or repaired in the affected area in such a way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required
to obtain FAA approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the paragraph of each
AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this notice to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 10 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately
72 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour.
Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to the operators. Based on these figures, the total
cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $43,200, or $4,320 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the
proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this
AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting
the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption

 This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding applicability provision, regardless of whether it has
been modified, altered, or repaired in the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been
modified, altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the owner/operator
must use the authority provided in paragraph (c) to request approval from the FAA. This approval may address either
no action, if the current configuration eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address
the unsafe condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect of the changed
configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case does the presence of any modification, alteration,
or repair remove any airplane from the applicability of this AD.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Military) series airplanes, and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes. This proposal would require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repetitive replacement of the emergency power switch in the overhead switch panel with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a new switch. This proposal is prompted by a report of heavy smoke in the cockpit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coming from the overhead switch panel on a Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;81 series airplane. The actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure replacement of the emergency power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
switch when it has reached its maximum life limit; an emergency power switch that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not replaced could fail and lead to a short in the electrical circuit, which could result in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fire in the overhead switch panel and smoke in the cockpit.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA has received a report of heavy smoke in the cockpit coming from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overhead switch panel on a McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;81 (MD&hyph;81) series airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Investigation revealed that the fire had originated in the area of the emergency power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
switch in the overhead switch panel. Further investigation, conducted by Mason Electric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Company (the manufacturer of the emergency power switch), revealed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency power switch, upon exceeding 10,000 switch cycles (off-to-on-to-off) can fail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to wear or overstress. If not replaced in a timely manner, the emergency power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
switch could fail and lead to a short in the electrical circuit, which could result in a fire in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the overhead switch panel and smoke in the cockpit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 Service Bulletin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24&hyph;150, dated March 28, 1994, which describes procedures for repetitively replacing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency power switch in the overhead switch panel with a new switch at regular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require repetitively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacing the emergency power switch in the overhead switch panel with a new switch at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regular intervals. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the service bulletin described previously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice to clarify this requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 1,990 Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 (Military) series 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA estimates that 992 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts would cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $1,434 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,541,568, or $1,554 per airplane, per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement cycle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Note 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
This AD applies to each airplane identified in the preceding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability provision, regardless of whether it has been modified, altered, or repaired in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the area subject to the requirements of this AD. For airplanes that have been modified, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
altered, or repaired so that the performance of the requirements of this AD is affected, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner/operator must use the authority provided in paragraph (b) to request approval from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA. This approval may address either no action, if the current configuration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eliminates the unsafe condition; or different actions necessary to address the unsafe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition described in this AD. Such a request should include an assessment of the effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the changed configuration on the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. In no case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does the presence of any modification, alteration, or repair remove any airplane from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicability of this AD.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Prior to the accumulation of 3 years time-in-service on the emergency power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
switch in the overhead switch panel, or within 12 months after the effective date of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AD, whichever occurs later, replace the emergency power switch with a new switch, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 Service Bulletin 24&hyph;150, dated March 28, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994. Thereafter, replace the emergency power switch at intervals not to exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accumulation of 3 years time-in-service on the switch. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Los 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Angeles Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to adopt a new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Schempp-Hirth Cirrus and Cirrus VTC sailplanes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed action would require modifying the airbrake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actuating lever and replacing the airbrake system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coupling balls. Reports of the coupling balls on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airbrake actuating lever breaking at the threaded end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on several of the above-referenced sailplanes prompted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed action. The actions specified by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed AD are intended to prevent airbrake system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure caused by the above condition, which, if not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected and corrected, could result in sailplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controllability problems.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA), which is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airworthiness authority for Germany, recently notified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on Schempp-Hirth Cirrus and Cirrus VTC sailplanes. The LBA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
advises that the coupling balls on the airbrake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actuating lever located inside the fuselage have broken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the threaded end on several of the above referenced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sailplanes. This condition, if not detected and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrected, could result in sailplane controllability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Schempp-Hirth has issued Technical Note 265&hyph;10, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dated November 5, 1992, which specifies procedures for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifying the airbrake actuating lever and replacing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the airbrake system coupling balls. The LBA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
classified this technical note as urgent in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Germany.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Germany and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is type certificated for operation in the United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bilateral airworthiness agreement, the LBA has kept the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has examined the findings of the LBA, reviewed all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available information, and determined that AD action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for products of this type design that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificated for operation in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is likely to exist or develop in other Schempp-Hirth 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cirrus and Cirrus VTC sailplanes of the same type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design, the proposed AD would require modifying the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
airbrake actuating lever and replacing the airbrake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system coupling balls. The proposed actions would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplished in accordance with the service information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referenced above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 21 sailplanes in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would take approximately 1 workhour per sailplane to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accomplish the proposed action, and that the average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. Parts cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately $25 per airplane. Based on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,785. This figure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is based on the assumption that no affected sailplane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owner/operator has accomplished the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification and replacement. The FAA believes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several of the 21 affected sailplane owners/operators 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have already accomplished the proposed action, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would reduce the FAA's proposed cost impact upon the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial direct effects on the States, on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the national government and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, or on the distribution of power and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibilities among the various levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated, will not have a significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice of proposed rulemaking is issued by the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA) to place 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA) into Schedule I of the Controlled Substances
Act (CSA). This proposed action by the DEA Deputy Administrator is based on data gathered and reviewed by the DEA. If
finalized, this proposed action would impose the regulatory control mechanisms and criminal sanctions of Schedule
I on the manufacture, distribution, and possession of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 6, 1994, the Acting Administrator of the DEA published a final rule in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 671) amending &sect;1308.11(g) of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations to temporarily place 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA
into Schedule I of the CSA pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h). This final rule, which
became effective on the date of publication, was based on findings by the Acting Administrator that the temporary
scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA was necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. Section 201(h)(2)
of the CSA (21 U.S.C. 811(h)(2)) requires that the temporary scheduling of a substance expires at the end of one year
from the effective date of the order. However, if proceedings to schedule a substance pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a)(1)
have been initiated and are pending, the temporary scheduling of a substance may be extended for up to six months. Under
this provision, the temporary scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA which would expire on January 6, 1995, may be extended
to July 6, 1995. This extension is being ordered by the DEA Deputy Administrator in a separate action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DEA has gathered and reviewed the available information regarding the trafficking, actual abuse and the relative
potential for abuse for 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA. The Deputy Administrator has submitted this data to the Assistant Secretary
for Health, Department of Health and Human Services. In accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b), the Deputy Administrator
also requested a scientific and medical evaluation and a scheduling recommendation for 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA from
the Assistant Secretary for Health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has notified the DEA that there are no exemptions or approvals in effect under
Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA. A search of the scientific and medical
literature revealed no indications of current medical use of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA is structurally similar to the Schedule I phenylisopropylamine hallucinogens, 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine
(DOB). Like DOM and DOB, 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA displays high affinity for central serotonin receptors and is capable
of substituting for DOM or DOB in drug discrimination studies conducted in rats. These data suggest that 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA
is a psychoactive substance capable of producing effects similar, though not identical, to DOM and DOB. Data from
human studies indicate that 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA is orally active at 0.1&hyph;0.2 mg/kg producing an intoxication
with considerable euphoria and sensory enhancement which lasts for 6 to 8 hours. Higher doses have been reported to
produce intense and frightening hallucinations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The DEA first encountered 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA in 1979. Since that time, several exhibits of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA have
been analyzed by Federal and state forensic laboratories in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois,
Iowa, Kentucky, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Texas. Clandestine laboratories producing 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA were seized
in California in 1986 and 1994 and in Arizona in 1992. It has been represented as 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine
(MDMA) and has been sold in sugar cubes as LSD. Recently, 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA has been promoted as an aphrodisiac and
distributed under the product name of Nexus. DEA has seized several thousand dosage units of this product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator, based on the information gathered and reviewed by his staff and after consideration of
the factors in 21 U.S.C. 811(c), believes that sufficient data exist to propose and to support that 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA
be placed into Schedule I of the CSA pursuant to 21 U.S.C. 811(a). The specific findings required pursuant to 21 U.S.C.
811 and 812 for a substance to be placed into Schedule I are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before issuing a final rule in this matter, the DEA Deputy Administrator will take into consideration the scientific
and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services
in accordance with 21 U.S.C. 811(b). The Deputy Administrator will also consider relevant comments from other concerned
parties. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit their comments, objections, or requests for a hearing in writing with regard
to this proposal. Requests for a hearing should state with particularity the issues concerning which the person desires
to be heard. All correspondence regarding this matter should be submitted to the Deputy Administrator, Drug Enforcement
Administration, Washington, D.C. 20537, Attention: DEA Federal Register Representative. In the event that comments,
objections, or requests for a hearing raise one or more issues which the Deputy Administrator finds warrants a hearing,
the Deputy Administrator shall order a public hearing by notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, summarizing the issues to be heard and setting the time for the hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator of the DEA hereby certifies that proposed placement of 4-bromo-2,5-DMPEA into Schedule
I of the CSA will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. This action involves the control of a substance with no currently accepted medical
use in the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order (E.O.) 12866
of September 30, 1993. Drug scheduling matters are not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
pursuant to provisions of E.O. 12866, Section 3(d)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in E.O. 12612, and it has been determined
that this proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism
Assessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Coast Guard announces an open meeting to hear the public's opinions on how best to implement amendments contained
in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) that relate to the statutory obligation of certain U.S. and foreign flag vessels
to report to the Coast Guard specific ``marine casualties.'' Following the public meeting, the Coast Guard will decide
whether to propose changes to existing regulations, to propose new regulations, or to implement the statutory changes
through non-regulatory means.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Current Coast Guard regulations in part 4 of title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) meet the requirements
of 46 U.S.C. 6101 for reporting of the following marine casualties: (1) Death of an individual; (2) serious injury
to an individual; (3) material loss of property; and (4) material damage affecting the seaworthiness or efficiency
of the vessel. Part 4 covers submittal of timely reports and investigation by the Coast Guard.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, under the current regulations, U.S. flag vessels are required to report a marine casualty, to the Coast
Guard, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the casualty occurs. However, current Coast Guard regulations do
not require foreign flag vessels to report any marine casualty, such as a non-operational discharge of oil, when operating
in waters beyond the navigable waters of the United States.

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380) amends 46 U.S.C. 6101 by adding the term ``significant
harm to the environment'' to the list of reportable marine casualties. The amendment also provides that foreign flag
tank vessels operating in waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction beyond the navigable waters of the United States (i.e.,
within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ)) must report to the extent consistent with generally recognized principles
of international law, two categories of marine casualties, those resulting in_(1) material damage affecting the
seaworthiness or efficiency of a vessel; and (2) significant harm to the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard is interested in information and opinions concerning how the Coast Guard should respond to the following
major issues raised by the amendments to 46 U.S.C. 6101 as set forth in OPA 90.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Should regulatory changes be made to define and secure reporting of ``significant harm to the environment'' casualties
in the U.S. navigable waters (foreign flag and U.S. flag vessels)? Do the provisions in 46 CFR 4.03&hyph;2 (b) and (c)
adequately define incidents which include those having a potential to cause ``significant harm to the environment?''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. How should the Coast Guard define and implement the requirement for reporting of ``significant harm to the environment''
and ``material damage'' casualties for foreign flag tank vessels in waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including
the EEZ, consistent with ``generally recognized principles of international law?'' Do the provisions of 46 CFR 4.05&hyph;1(b)
and (c) adequately define incidents which include ``material damage?''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. How should the Coast Guard impose any reporting requirements for foreign tank vessels in the EEZ_on inbound, outbound,
or transiting vessels?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Should any regulations be located as amendments to the existing regulations under 46 U.S.C. 6101 at 46 CFR part 4
or in the pollution prevention regulations implementing international pollution control agreements (33 CFR part
151)?

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified
at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. The air quality planning requirements for the reduction of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions are set out in section 182(f) of the CAA. On November 25, 1992, EPA published a NPRM (57 FR 55620) entitled,
``State Implementation Plans; Nitrogen Oxides Supplement to the General Preamble; Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
Implementation of Title I; Proposed Rule,'' (the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Supplement) which describes the requirements of section 182(f). The November 25, 1992, notice should be referred
to for further information on the NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requirements and is incorporated into this document by reference.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 182(f) of the Act requires States to apply the same requirements to major stationary sources of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (``major'' as defined in section 302 and section 182 (c), (d), and (e)) as are applied to major stationary sources of
volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These requirements are RACT and New Source Review (NSR) for major stationary
sources in certain ozone nonattainment areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RACT requirements for major stationary sources of VOCs are contained in section 182(b)(2), while the NSR requirements
are contained in section 182(a)(2)(C) and other provisions of section 182. Section 182(b)(2) requires submittal
of RACT rules for major stationary sources of VOC emissions (not covered by a pre-enactment control technologies
guidelines (CTG) document or a post-enactment CTG document). There were no NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 sources since enactment of the CAA. Section 182(a)(2)(C) requires submittal of NSR rules incorporating the new preconstruction
permitting requirements for new or modified sources. The RACT and NSR rules were required to be submitted by November
15, 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Monterey Bay Area is classified as a moderate

Thus, a State may submit a petition for a section 182(f) exemption based on air quality monitoring data. The EPA's approval
of the exemption, if warranted, would be granted on a contingent basis (i.e., the exemption would last for only as long
as the area's monitoring data continue to demonstrate attainment). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's exemption guidance provides that, pursuant to the requirements of section 110(a)(2), States should consider
evidence, such as photochemical grid modeling, which shows that granting the NO

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Attainment of the ozone NAAQS is determined based on the expected number of exceedances in a calendar year. Ozone attainment
must rely on three complete, consecutive calendar years of quality-assured air quality monitoring data, collected
in accordance with 40 CFR parts 50 and 58, including Appendices. The method for determining attainment of the ozone
NAAQS is contained in 40 CFR part 50, &sect;50.9 and appendix H to that Section.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 appendix H of 40 CFR part 50 explains how to determine when the expected number of days per calendar year with maximum
hourly average concentrations above 0.12 ppm ozone is equal to or less than 1. This section also discusses how to account
for incomplete data sets. The EPA ``Guideline for the Interpretation of Ozone Air Quality Standards'' elaborates
on Appendix H. In general, expected exceedances are calculated by averaging actual exceedances at each monitoring
site over a three year period. An area is in attainment of the standard if this average results in expected exceedances
for each monitoring site of 1.0 or less per calendar year.

At the monitoring sites used to evaluate the attainment status of Monterey County, there has been only one exceedance
of the ozone NAAQS. This exceedance was monitored in 1991 at the Pinnacles site. There have been no violations of the
ozone NAAQS during the 1991&hyph;1993 period. Based on ambient air monitoring data for the years 1991&hyph;1993
(including data from the Pinnacles site which helped form the basis for the Monterey County nonattainment designation
of 1990), it is clear that additional reductions of NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future implementation

Regulatory Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et. seq., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing
the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that
the rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses,
small not-for-profit enterprises and government entities with jurisdiction over population of less than 50,000.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption action does not create any new requirements, but allows suspension of the indicated requirements
for the life of the exemption. Therefore, because the proposed approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify
that it does not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship
under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic
reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 By this action, EPA is reproposing a maximum contaminant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level goal (MCLG), and a National Primary Drinking Water Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NPDWR) including a maximum contaminant level (MCL) for sulfate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is a potential for an adverse health effect for infants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
travelers, and new residents in areas that have high sulfate levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in their drinking water. The objective of this rule is to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that sulfate levels in drinking water provided by public water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems are reduced below levels of concern. The proposal contains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternatives that allow public water systems the flexibility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
select compliance options appropriate to protect the population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
served.

I. Summary of Today's Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today the Agency is proposing an MCLG of 500 mg/L, an MCL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 500 mg/L, and other NPDWR requirements for sulfate. Sulfate is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a unique contaminant for several reasons. The health effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the ingestion of relatively high levels of sulfate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in drinking water (i.e., ranging from loose stools to diarrhea) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acute and temporary, and is expected to last 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately two weeks. In addition, the health risk only applies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to persons not already acclimated to high sulfate-containing water: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infants, travelers, and new residents. (For the purposes of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, infants are defined as children up to the age of 12 months.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed rule is also unique because it affects all public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water systems, that is, community water systems, traveler non-community water systems, and non-transient, non-community
water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. In the past, only regulations on microbial contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and nitrate have affected transient, non-community systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA decided to defer promulgation of a sulfate standard, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
originally proposed July 25, 1990 (55 FR 30370) in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify an implementation approach which was tailored to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
target populations. The approach EPA developed, working in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooperation with several States at a 1992 meeting, is innovative, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and was designed specifically to provide flexibility to smaller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. This approach could reduce compliance costs while still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing adequate protection of public health. It provides public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water systems a means of compliance which is less expensive than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
central treatment, and it affords States flexibility in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing the rule. Under this approach, the State would have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the authority to allow the public water system (PWS), as one means 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of compliance with the sulfate MCL, to provide ``Alternative Water'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and public education/notification to the targeted, sensitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population. A PWS authorized to comply under this option would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choose to supply customers with ``Alternative Water'', defined as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either bottled water which has been monitored or certified to be in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with all EPA MCLs, or water treated by point-of-use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(POU) or point-of-entry (POE) devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interest of reducing costs and maximizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility, the proposal allows for unique means of compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four options are being proposed for public comment. The lead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option requires provision of alternative water to both transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adults (travelers and new residents) and infants. Two variations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the lead option require provision of alternative water to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infants only. These two options differ only in the content of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public notification. In one case, only infants are considered at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk, and temporary diarrhea is considered as only an inconvenience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for adults. In the other, both adults and infants are considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at risk, but public notification is deemed sufficient protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for adults. Because the lead option and its two variations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent a significant change in regulatory approach, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered another, more conventional option. This fourth option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would enable systems to seek a variance from the sulfate MCL. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a condition of receiving a variance, systems would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide alternative water to their target populations, just as in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the lead option. The only difference is that the relief for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems would be provided through a different statutory mechanism. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also considered limiting compliance to central 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment, which would be consistent with the approach for other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants, but which would not provide flexibility for smaller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency expects that approximately 1,500 of the 2,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected systems would choose the lead option (Option 1) if it were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to them. The annual cost to those systems is estimated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be $7 million. The Agency has conservatively assumed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining 500 systems would choose central treatment or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regionalization in spite of the availability of Option 1. The cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to those systems is estimated to be $71 million. Total national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of Option 1, including $8 million for State implementation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring costs, is $86 million. If central treatment were the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only means of compliance with the sulfate rule, the annual national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost would be $147 million (household costs ranging from $244 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$811). Household costs for Option 1 range from $106 to $287 per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year, but this is an average of all households in all systems, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including those choosing central treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an effort to reduce the cost of this rule even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further, the Agency is giving serious consideration to variations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Option 1. These variations, described as Options 2 and 3, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require public notification/education, but would only require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision of bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs to infants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The difference between Options 2 and 3 is that Option 2 would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
target only infants as being at risk from an adverse effect, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 3 would target both adults and infants, but would propose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that public notification/education is sufficient protection for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adults. The Agency sees advantages and disadvantages to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative options, which are discussed later in this notice. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost for either option would be $16 million, which includes $8 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million for State implementation and monitoring costs. Household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs for these two options would be from $2 to $145 per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also considered Option 4, which would achieve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same result as Option 1, but with different administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures involving a variance from the sulfate MCL. Under Option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4, the regulation would specify that the conditions for States to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grant a variance from the sulfate MCL would include the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements described for Option 1, namely public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification/education and Alternative Water provisions. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements would be defined as BAT only for the purposes of Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1415 of the SDWA. The Agency believes that the unique nature of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sulfate health effect warrants a more flexible perspective on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the implementation of the Act. The Agency recognizes that while the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transitory nature of the diarrhetic effect of high-sulfate water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may be uncomfortable and inconvenient for healthy adults, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential risk to infants of diarrhea, as well as the dehydration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and electrolyte imbalance which may be associated with it, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant and potentially fatal if untreated.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Statutory Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA or ``the Act''), as amended in 1986 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pub. L. No. 99&hyph;339, 100 Stat. 642), requires EPA to publish ``maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminant level goals'' (MCLGs) for contaminants which, in the judgment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Administrator, ``may have any adverse effect on the health of persons and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which (are) known or anticipated to occur in public water systems'' (Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1412(b)(3)(A)). MCLGs are to be set at a level at which ``no known or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons occur and which allows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an adequate margin of safety'' (Section 1412(b)(4)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concurrent with EPA publishing an MCLG, which is a non-enforceable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health goal, it must promulgate a National Primary Drinking Water Regulation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NPDWR) which includes either: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) an MCL, or (2) a required treatment technique (Section 1401(1), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1412(a)(3), and 1412(b)(7)(A)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An MCL must be set as close to the MCLG as feasible (Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1412(b)(4)). Under the Act, ``feasible'' means ``feasible with the use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
best technology, treatment techniques and other means which the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finds, after examination for efficacy under field conditions and not solely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under laboratory conditions (taking cost into consideration)'' (Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1412(b)(5)). In setting MCLs, EPA considers the cost of treatment technology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to large public water systems (i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
&gt;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1,000,000 people) with relatively clean source water supplies (132 Cong. Rec. S6287 (daily ed., May 21, 1986)).
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Each NPDWR that establishes an MCL must list the best available technology, treatment techniques, and other means
that are feasible for meeting the MCL (Section 1412(b)(6)). NPDWRs include monitoring, analytical and quality assurance
requirements, specifically, ``criteria and procedures, to assure a supply of drinking water which dependably complies
with such maximum contaminant levels&blank;*&blank;*&blank;*.'' (Section 1401(1)(D)). Section 1445 also authorizes
EPA to promulgate monitoring requirements.

A treatment technique may be required if it is not ``economically or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologically feasible'' to ascertain the level of a contaminant (Sections 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1401(1) and 1412(b)(7)(A)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1414(c) requires each owner or operator of a PWS to give notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to persons served by it of (1) any failure to comply with a maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminant level, treatment technique, or testing procedure required by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPDWR; (2) any failure to comply with any monitoring required pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1445 of the Act; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) the existence of a variance or exemption; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) any failure to comply with the requirements of any schedule prescribed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to a variance or exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the 1986 Amendments to the SDWA, EPA was to complete the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation of NPDWRs for 83 listed contaminants, including sulfate, by June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19, 1989. After 1989, an additional 25 contaminants must be regulated every 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three years (section 1412(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the 1986 Amendments to the SDWA, Congress required that MCLGs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCLs be proposed and promulgated simultaneously (section 1412(a)(3)). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change streamlined development of drinking water standards by combining two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steps in the regulation development process. Section 1412(a)(2) renamed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommended maximum contaminant levels (RMCLs) as maximum contaminant level 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals (MCLGs).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is required by the 1986 amendments to the SDWA to issue a proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and final standard for sulfate. EPA grouped sulfate with 23 other organic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and inorganic compounds in the ``Phase V'' regulatory package proposal. The 24 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants were among the last of the original list of 83 to be regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the SDWA. On June 25, 1990 EPA proposed the Phase V regulation, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate (published at 55 FR 30370, July 25, 1990). In the notice, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described the health effects associated with sulfate (see 55 FR 30382&hyph;83). The notice stated that the available
scientific information suggests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an adverse health effect from ingesting high levels of sulfate is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diarrhea and associated dehydration. Because local populations usually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acclimate to high sulfate levels, the impact is primarily on infants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transient populations (e.g., business travelers, visitors and vacationers), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and new residents. In the 1990 notice, EPA proposed alternative levels of 400 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mg/L and 500 mg/L for the MCLG for sulfate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Fall of 1991, as EPA was nearing publication of regulations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 24 Phase V contaminants, it became apparent that the Agency had not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached a consensus on how to proceed with the sulfate regulation in light of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns raised by the commenters. Given the high cost of the rule, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively low risk, and the need to explore alternative regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approaches targeted at the transient consumer, EPA decided to seek a deferral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a final regulatory decision on sulfate. The Agency needed more time to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resolve issues that included: (1) Whether additional research is needed on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
how long it takes infants to acclimate to water with high sulfate content, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) whether new regulatory approaches were needed for regulating a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminant whose health effect is confined largely to transient populations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3) whether the Agency should revise its definition of BAT for small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems (i.e., what should be considered affordable for the small, transient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-community water systems). For the above reasons, the regulation on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate was deferred. A new schedule has been established in connection with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
litigation brought over the schedule for regulating sulfate. This schedule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires EPA to finalize its regulatory action for sulfate by May 1996. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL) for sulfate is 250 mg/L 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is based on aesthetic effects (i.e., taste and odor). EPA is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing changes in the SMCL for sulfate, but is requesting public comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the correlation between sulfate concentrations, palatability, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption of high-sulfate water by the public.

C. Sulfate General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sulfate is the divalent anion (SO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). It exists in a variety of inorganic compounds and salts formed with metal cations. Sulfate salts with lower molecular
weight alkali metals such as sodium, potassium, and magnesium are very water soluble and are often found in natural
waters. Salts of higher molecular weight metals such as barium, iron or lead have very low water solubility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sulfate is found in soil sediments and rocks, and occurs in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment as a result of both natural processes and human activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specific data on the total production of all sulfates are not available, but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production is expected to be thousands of tons per year; the use of sodium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate alone in 1987 was reported to be 792 tons. Sulfate is used for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variety of commercial purposes, including pickle liquor (sulfuric acid) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steel and metal industries, and as a reagent in manufacturing of products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as copper sulfate (a fungicide/algicide). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sulfate may enter surface and ground water as a result of discharge or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of sulfate-containing wastes. In addition, sulfur oxides produced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the combustion of fossil fuels are transformed to sulfuric acid in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmosphere. Through precipitation (i.e., acid rain), sulfuric acid can enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface waters, lowering the pH and raising sulfate levels.

A. Establishment of MCLG for Sulfate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The MCLG for sulfate is reproposed today at a level of 500 mg/L. In this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notice, EPA is responding to the public comments submitted in reference to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the MCLG options contained in the July 1990 proposal. EPA's complete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responses to the public comments on the previously proposed MCLGs appear in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Comment/Response Document that is included in the docket for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCLGs are set at concentration levels at which no known or anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse health effects occur, allowing for an adequate margin of safety. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process for establishing an MCLG for a contaminant has been described in many 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents, including the final Phase V rule issued in July 1992 (57 FR 31781&hyph;31783).

1. Health Effects
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The available information on the health effects of sulfate was fully described in the July 25, 1990 (55 FR 30370) Phase
V proposal. Studies mentioned in that notice are summarized in the Health Criteria Document for Sulfate (US EPA, 1992),
which is available for review and comment in the docket for this rulemaking. Since that time, EPA has funded additional
studies on humans and piglets which are currently under review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the July 25, 1990 notice, EPA stated that there was no evidence of adverse health effects in animals or humans from
chronic exposure to sulfate in drinking water. The available health data indicate that chronic exposure to sulfate
is not harmful to health.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The acute effects noted from exposure to high levels of sulfate range from soft stools to diarrhea. Infants may be more
sensitive to sulfate than healthy adults. Infants consume more water and food on a body weight basis than adults, and
consequently ingest a higher dose of sulfate (per body weight) in drinking high-sulfate water than do adults. In infants,
the greatest risk is from dehydration and electrolyte imbalance that may result from diarrhea. This effect can be
fatal if untreated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It has been questioned whether the concentration of sulfate found in drinking water would cause significant dehydration
in infants or adults. Schild (1980) reported that eight grams of sulfate retain 120 milliliters of water in the intestine.
In this case, an adult drinking two liters of water containing 1500 milligrams of sulfate per liter would ingest three
grams of sulfate and retain 45 milliliters of water in the intestine. The Agency is requesting any scientific data
which would support or refute the hypothesis that this decrease in available water is likely to cause dehydration
and electrolyte imbalance in adults or infants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are three documented case histories of infants, 5 to 12 months old, who were given formulas prepared with water
containing 630 to 1,150 mg/L of sulfate (Chien, et al., 1968). These infants developed diarrhea shortly after they
ingested the formula, but the effect subsided after use of the high sulfate water was discontinued. Cole (1992) evaluated
this study and concluded that neither the potential effects of osmolarity, specifically hyperosmolarity, nor viral
gastroenteritis had been considered as possible causes of the observed diarrhea. Thus, Cole suggested and the Agency
agrees that the Chien study provides qualitative evidence of the effects of sulfate but should not be used quantitatively
in a sulfate risk assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similar effects have been observed in adults, but individuals seem to become acclimated to high sulfate levels in
a short period of time, with a cessation of all ill effects.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The laxative effect of sulfate is well-known. Peterson (1951) compiled the results of questionnaires sent to North
Dakota residents and concluded that ``waters with 600 to 750 ppm sulfates should be looked upon with suspicion as they
may or may not be laxative. Over 750 ppm sulfates is generally a laxative water and below 600 ppm sulfates should be considered
safe.'' Moore (1952) replotted the Peterson data and found that as sulfate concentrations increased from 500 to 1000
mg/L, the number of adults reporting laxative effects also increased. At concentrations of sulfate above 1,000 mg/L,
the majority of respondents noted a laxative effect. While it is not known how long is needed to achieve acclimation
in adults or infants, EPA scientists believe the time to be approximately two weeks, based on mucosal cell turnover
rate in the intestines.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is using these studies to support the MCLG, although each has limitations. For example, in the Peterson
(1951) study, there is no information available on the chemical composition or the microbiological quality of the
water, nor on the length of time that people drank the water.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are insufficient data to calculate a precise and reliable quantification of the exact dose which will cause
diarrhea in a given percentage of the susceptible population. Some sulfate salts are used as laxative agents. Their
mechanism of action is known, and there is apparently little interest in the medical community in additional research
on the subject. Acclimation to sulfate is assumed due to the fact that people living in regions with high-sulfate drinking
water seem to have no adverse effect, whereas newcomers drinking that region's water will initially experience the
laxative effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing the MCLG for sulfate, issues were raised concerning the ability of infants to acclimate to sulfate in
drinking water. In 1992, EPA convened an expert panel to discuss the sulfate data base (US EPA, 1992). The panel (D.E.C.
Cole, Children's Hospital, Halifax, Nova Scotia; M. Cassidy, George Washington University, Washington, DC; and
M. Morris, State University of New York, Amherst, NY) concluded that the lack of data on the sulfate content and the
osmolarity of the formulas used in the Chien et al. (1968) study prevents it from being a reliable estimate of the level
of sulfate that would induce diarrhea in infants. They concluded that: (1) Additional studies on sulfate are desirable,
(2) the Chien et al. (1968) study cannot be used quantitatively, (3) the 500 mg/L value for sulfate is conservative
for adults, and there are no differences between sulfate levels of 400 and 500 mg/L, (4) the three cases of diarrhea
reported in the Chien study may or may not be attributable to sulfate, and (5) acute short-term effects are the appropriate
focus for risk assessment and further research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The panel members recommended additional research with piglets and humans. EPA agreed and initiated studies in collaboration
with the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and the North Carolina State University Department of Animal
Science. These studies have been completed and are undergoing internal and external peer review.

2. Occurrence and Human Exposure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The available information on the occurrence and human exposure to sulfate was fully described in the July 25, 1990
proposal. Since that time, additional State data have been gathered and used to update the information in Table 8.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Review of data sources for estimating national occurrence levels of sulfate included: The Community Water Supply
Study (CWSS) released in 1969; the Rural Water Survey (RWS) from the late 1970s; new State survey data from Utah, North
and South Dakota, and Texas: The Federal Reporting Data System (FRDS) and STORET, EPA's computerized water quality
data base. In the CWSS, 106 surface water supplies sampled had an apparent detection limit of 1 mg/L. For the ground
water supplies the mean of the positive sulfate detections was approximately 43 mg/L (range of 1 to 480 mg/L), and for
surface water it was approximately 49 mg/L (range of 2 to 358 mg/L). The Rural Water Survey (RWS) reported a lower frequency
of positives and a higher mean of the positive values, but this lower frequency probably reflects the higher detection
limit of 15 mg/L. In the RWS, sulfate was reported to be present in 271 of 494 ground water supplies with a mean of about
98 mg/L (range of 10 to 1,000 mg/L) for the positives (some laboratories can achieve accuracy at levels lower than the
published detection limit of 15 mg/L). In surface water, it was found in 101 of 154 supplies, with a mean of 53 mg/L (range
of 15 to 321 mg/L) for the positives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, sulfate can be formed in the atmosphere, and EPA has reported ambient levels during the period of 1980&hyph;1986
to range from 0.2 to 199.4 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
g/m3. Since the amounts of sulfate that could be transferred from the atmosphere through the pulmonary system to the
gastrointestinal tract are minuscule compared to what could be ingested in drinking water, atmospheric levels are
not of concern for the purposes of this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No information is available on the occurrence of sulfate in foods, nor are there any estimates on dietary intake. The
Agency did not follow its usual practice of determining a relative source contribution (RSC) factor. As with certain
other inorganic contaminants (nitrate, fluoride, barium, manganese), calculation of RSC is not appropriate for
sulfate because the MCLG is derived directly from human exposure to the contaminant in drinking water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Previously Proposed MCLG
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In July 1990, EPA proposed two alternative options for the sulfate MCLG based on the available health information.
The first option was to set the MCLG at 400 mg/L, based on a Science Advisory Board (SAB) conclusion that sulfate's mode
of action is well known and some human data are available indicating that ill effects occur only at concentrations
above 600 mg/L (Peterson, 1951). SAB applied a small uncertainty factor of 1.5 to the 600
<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
 mg/L level to give a recommended MCLG of 400 mg/L. Their recommendation corresponded to the World Health Organization
(WHO) sulfate standard of 400 mg/L, which is based on aesthetic considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second option was to set the MCLG at 500 mg/L. As a basis for choosing this option, EPA referred to the survey conducted
by Peterson (1951) and evaluated by Moore (1952). Combining the questionnaire respondents into discrete groups,
Moore indicated that the number of adults reporting laxative effects increased at sulfate concentrations above
500 mg/L.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Health Protection Branch of Health and Welfare/Canada has indicated to EPA (Canadian Guidelines, 1991) that
the maximum acceptable concentration of sulfate in water is 500 mg/L, considered an aesthetic objective, since ``at
this level sulfate gives an objectionable taste, but is still below the level at which we would expect to see deleterious
health effects''. The Agency notes that the Canadian sulfate guideline of 500 mg/L and the lack of health problems
reported at that level lends support to the proposed MCLG. Canada does not yet have national drinking water regulations.
Their guidelines are offered to the provinces, which may choose to adopt them as provincial regulations.

Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There were 15 separate comments concerning sulfate on the 1990 proposed rule. Several commenters believed that EPA
should not regulate sulfate due to a lack of adequate health data, lack of chronic effects and because people acclimate
to the laxative effects of sulfate. Eleven commenters stated that if it were necessary to regulate sulfate, that the
MCLG should be higher than 500 mg/L (between 600 and 1,000 mg/L). The remaining four commenters stated that 500 mg/L
was protective. One commenter stated that the usual approach for deriving the MCLG_an RfD calculation_should be
used for sulfate. Another commenter cited a July 17, 1989 letter from the Metals Subcommittee of the Science Advisory
Board's Environmental Health Committee to the Administrator stating that the Subcommittee could not support the
setting of an acute MCLG, and recommending additional study before regulation. Several commenters urged EPA not
to regulate sulfate, stating that a secondary MCL is sufficient. They noted that infants as well as adults acclimate
to sulfate, sulfate is present in food, and the WHO guidelines are based on taste considerations and not health effects.
Several commenters noted that systems which do not serve the target population, infants in particular, should be
excused from complying with the sulfate regulation. Several commenters questioned EPA's cost analysis.

EPA Response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Some commenters noted that no chronic health effects have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with long-term exposure to high levels of sulfate. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate can have acute adverse effects on non-acclimated persons. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population at risk is readily identified and targeted for protective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measures. While the laxative effect eases and disappears as the person 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acclimates to the high sulfate concentration, the individual is subject to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
debilitation during the acclimation period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Diarrhea and/or laxative effects have been reported in infants ingesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water with high levels of sulfate and in adults at concentrations in the 500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 1000 mg/L range. EPA believes an MCL level of 500 mg/L will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently protective of infants and adults. An RfD for sulfate has not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SMCLs for aesthetic qualities relating to the public acceptance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drinking water are not federally enforceable, and intended only as guidance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the States. SMCLs do not meet the statutory requirement to set an NPDWR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for sulfate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The requirements for transient and non-transient, non-community water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems which do not serve the target population frequently would be minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They could achieve compliance by placing permanent signs at drinking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fountains and having bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visitors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has updated the occurrence data and the cost analysis since 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Phase V proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Today's Proposed MCLG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Today EPA is proposing an MCLG of 500 mg/L which represents the level at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which no known or anticipated adverse effects on human health occur, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which allows for an adequate margin of safety based on current data. As a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis for choosing this level, EPA notes that the survey conducted by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Peterson (1951) and evaluated by Moore (1952) indicated that the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people reporting laxative effects greatly increased at sulfate concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
above 500 mg/L. This concentration is considered protective of infants based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the information reported by Chien et al. (1968). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the MCLG for sulfate should be based on the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for causing loose stools and diarrhea. Infants are at risk from diarrhea 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of the cause, and unacclimated adults may also be at risk. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard to limit the intake of sulfate will protect the infant population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and unacclimated adults from potential adverse effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA requests comment on this proposed MCLG. EPA particularly requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any new data or any other new information that may be submitted in support of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or opposing the reproposed sulfate MCLG of 500 mg/L. In light of comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opposing the regulation of sulfate, the Agency is also requesting any new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data or information that would support a higher level for the MCLG. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency is particularly interested in comments that raise issues other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those that EPA has already considered and responded to above and in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
record for today's proposal.

1. Methodology for Determination of MCLs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SDWA directs EPA to set the MCL ``as close to'' the MCLG ``as is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible.'' The term ``feasible'' means ``feasible with the use of the best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology, treatment techniques, and other means, which the Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finds, after examination for efficacy under field conditions and not solely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under laboratory conditions, are available (taking costs into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration)'', (SDWA section 1412(b)(5)). Each NPDWR that establishes an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCL lists the technology, treatment techniques, and other means which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrator finds to be feasible for meeting the MCL (SDWA section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1412(b)(6)).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The present statutory standard for BAT under 1412(b)(5) represents a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change from the provision prior to 1986, which required EPA to judge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasibility on the basis of ``best technologies generally available'' (BTGA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1986 Amendments to the SDWA changed BTGA to BAT and added the requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that BAT must be tested for efficacy under field conditions, not just under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory conditions. The legislative history explains that Congress removed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the term ``generally'' to assure that MCLs ``reflect the full extent of current technology capability'' (S. Rep.
No. 56, 99th Cong., 1st Session at 6 (1985)). EPA has concluded that the statutory term ``best available technology''
is a broader standard than ``best technology generally available'' and that this standard allows EPA to select a technology
that is not necessarily in widespread use, as long as its performance has been validated in a reliable manner. In addition,
EPA believes that the technology selected need not necessarily have been field tested for each specific contaminant
but, rather, that the operating conditions may be projected for a specific contaminant using a field tested technology
from laboratory or pilot systems data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the statutory directive for setting the MCLs, EPA derives the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCLs based on an evaluation of (1) the availability and performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various technologies for removing the contaminant, and (2) the costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applying those technologies. Other technology factors considered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining the MCL include the ability of laboratories to measure accurately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and consistently the level of the contaminant with available analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's initial step in deriving the MCL is to make an engineering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment of technologies that are capable of removing a contaminant from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drinking water. EPA reviews the available data to determine technologies that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have the highest removal efficiencies, are compatible with other water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment processes, and are not limited to a particular geographic region. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the removal capabilities of the various technologies, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculates the level of each contaminant that is achievable by their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application to large systems with relatively clean raw water sources. (See H.R. Rep. 1185, 93rd Cong., 2nd Sess. at
13 (1974); 132 Cong. Rec. S6287, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
May 21, 1986, statement of Sen. Durenberger.)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When considering costs to control contaminants, EPA analyzes whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology is reasonably affordable by regional and large metropolitan PWSs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(See H.R. Rep. No. 93&hyph;1185 at 18 (1974) and 132 Cong. Rec. S6287 (May 21, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1986) (statement of Sen. Durenberger)). EPA also evaluates the total national 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance costs, considering the number of systems that will have to install 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment in order to comply with the MCL. The resulting total national costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vary depending upon the concentration level chosen as the MCL. The more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent the MCL, the greater the number of systems that may have to install 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAT to achieve compliance and the higher the national cost.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The feasibility of setting the MCL at a precise level is also influenced by laboratory ability to measure the contaminant
reliably. Because compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the MCL is determined by analysis with approved analytical techniques, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ability to analyze consistently and accurately for a contaminant at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCL is important for enforcing a regulatory standard. Thus, the feasibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of meeting a particular level is affected by the ability of analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods to determine with sufficient precision and accuracy whether such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level is actually being achieved.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the July 25, 1990 proposal, EPA identified two technologies as BATs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Section 1412 of the SDWA for sulfate: Reverse osmosis (RO) and ion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchange (IE). EPA believes that the costs of these technologies to large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems are reasonable, and that these technologies are compatible with other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water treatment processes in different regions of the U.S. These technologies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the costs of using them are described as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Reverse Osmosis. RO uses semi-permeable membranes to remove a high percentage of almost all inorganic ions. The technology
is relatively insensitive to flow and total dissolved solids (TDS). The effectiveness of RO is adversely affected
by the presence of turbidity, iron, manganese, silica, or scale-producing constituents in the source water. If pretreatment
is not already in place to remove these constituents, additional costs may be incurred to install other technologies
(e.g., pH adjustment, filtration, or scale-prevention additives). The cost generated by the model includes the
cost of a scale inhibitor. On the other hand, in situations where high dissolved solids and/or several contaminants
may have to be removed simultaneously, the RO process may offer an especially desirable and cost-effective approach
to their removal. Less chlorine may be needed due to removal of many bacteria and viruses during the RO process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Disadvantages to RO include fouling of membranes either from scaling or from water with high organic content and a
reject stream of 20% to 50% of the water flow. It is also possible that corrosion control chemicals will be needed after
RO, and a more qualified operator may be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Full scale tests indicate that RO is capable of removing between 86 and 97 percent of the sulfate, and is effectively
used for the reduction of contaminants other than sulfate. Estimated cost for reducing sulfate by RO range from $3.50/1,000
gallons for systems serving between 500 and 1,000 persons to $1.00/1,000 gallons for systems serving more than 1,000,000
persons. High sulfate levels are typically associated with high levels of TDS, which can indicate the presence of
other inorganics; in such cases, RO becomes a cost effective treatment technology because it removes those other
inorganics as well. Since the removal efficiency required for sulfate will typically be less than 86 percent, a portion
of the water can be treated and blended with an untreated portion to reduce the cost of this process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters to the Phase V proposed rule expressed concerns regarding the potential costs associated with disposal
of wastes generated by treatment processes such as RO, particularly in water-scarce regions. The Agency believes
that wastewater would be minimized, since only a portion of source water containing elevated sulfate levels would
need to be treated, and would then be blended with source water. With an MCL of 500 mg/L, EPA believes blending treated
water and source water would greatly reduce the reject stream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ion Exchange. IE reduces sulfate concentrations to levels below the MCLG of 500 mg/L at reasonable costs to large systems.
Typical sulfate anion removals using IE are greater than 75 percent in full-scale studies that evaluated influent
concentrations close to drinking water levels. Estimated costs for IE to reduce sulfate concentrations range from
$2.90/1,000 gallons for systems serving between 500 and 1,000 persons to $1.40/1,000 gallons for systems serving
more than 1,000,000 people. When the removal efficiency required for sulfate is less than 75 percent, a portion of
the water can be treated and blended with an untreated portion to reduce cost. For those systems with other anions that
need to be removed (such as nitrate), the removal efficiency will decrease for those anions since sulfate binds more
strongly to the exchange resin than other anions. A disadvantage of IE is that it may not be feasible at high levels of
TDS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA received a number of public comments on the proposal to select RO and IE as BATs for the Phase V inorganic contaminants
in general and for sulfate in particular. EPA's responses are in the comment-response document for the Phase V rulemaking
and in the preamble to the final rule (57 FR 31809&hyph;12). In the preamble, EPA responded to comments on sulfate in
particular concerning the disposal of wash brines from IE and RO treatments in water-scarce areas and on the costs
of using RO and IE to treat for sulfate. EPA is not aware of any new information on these two technologies or costs since
the proposal. Interested parties are invited to submit any new public comments or new information on the selection
of RO and IE as BAT for sulfate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electrodialysis. Since the Phase V proposal, EPA has identified electrodialysis (ED) as an additional proposed
BAT. EPA requests comment on its conclusion that electrodialysis should also be considered BAT for sulfate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ED was the first membrane process developed for desalting brackish waters, and was commercially available in the
1950's. In the early 1970's, a major technological improvement was made, called electrodialysis reversal. Recovery
ratios increased from the 50% to 60% range to 80% to 90% recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In ED, feed water containing dissolved ions is pumped across electrified membranes. The positive ions migrate to
the negative electrode, and the negative ions migrate to the positive electrode, and are effectively trapped in alternating
compartments. The partially deionized/dilute stream is circulated through additional stages until the desired
purity is obtained. Since this is a unidirectional process, membrane fouling and mineral scale formation tend to
degrade system performance. Some pretreatment may be required, such as clarification, presoftening, or treatment
with acid or anti-scaling agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electrodialysis reversal (EDR) is the same process but with the polarity of the current automatically reversed at
regular 15 to 30-minute intervals. This changes the direction of ion movement within the membrane stack. As a result,
foulants and scale tend to be removed from the membrane surfaces and carried away during the purge period. EDR requires
minimum pretreatment and is very tolerant of system upsets, shock chlorination, and long-term operation at temperatures
up to 45 C. Sulfate removal of 84% was achieved in a 1990 pilot study in Virginia, in which efficiency and costs for RO
and EDR were compared (AWWA, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Operating costs for EDR are comparable to those for RO. All reference to ED as BAT for sulfate removal in this notice
will refer to electrodialysis reversal, rather than unidirectional electrodialysis. Table 3 summarizes the efficiency
and cost of the treatment technologies proposed as BATs for sulfate, and indicates that each can reduce the contaminant
level from the maximum expected occurrence level to below the proposed MCLG. The costs in Table 3 are representative
of annual operation and maintenance (O &amp; M) costs plus annualized capital costs, and may differ depending on local
conditions. Costs may be lower if sulfate concentration levels encountered in the raw water are lower than those used
for the calculations, or higher if additional system-specific treatment or storage requirements are needed. The
general assumptions used to develop the treatment costs include: Capital costs amortized over 20 years at a 7 percent
interest rate; engineering fees; contractor overhead and profit; late 1991 power, fuel, labor and chemical costs.
The removal efficiencies cited in Table 3 are what is possible, and are not directly linked with the cited costs. These
costs are linked with the efficiency needed to achieve the sulfate MCL.

 The reliability of analytical methods used for compliance monitoring is critical at the MCL. EPA evaluated the availability,
costs and the performance of analytical methods for measuring sulfate, and considered the ability of laboratories
to measure consistently and accurately for sulfate at the level of the proposed MCL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In selecting analytical methods, EPA considers five factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Reliability (i.e., precision/accuracy) of the analytical results; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Specificity in the presence of interferences; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Availability of enough equipment and trained personnel to implement a national monitoring program; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Simplicity of analysis to permit routine use; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Cost of analysis to water supply systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sulfate has an SMCL of 250 mg/L for which EPA recommends measurements be made with an EPA method or a Standard Method
(SM) method (40 CFR 143.4(b)), each of which uses a turbidimetric analytical technique. The July 1990 proposal listed
analytical methods for sulfate that use one of four analytical techniques: turbidimetry, colorimetry, ion chromatography,
and gravimetry. The July 1992 regulations did not regulate sulfate, but specified a colorimetric analytical technique
to measure sulfate as an unregulated contaminant (40 CFR 141.409(n)(12)). However, the regulations did not list
specific colorimetric methods. In an analytical methods proposal (58 FR 60622, December 15, 1993) EPA removed this
ambiguity by identifying several colorimetric methods. The December 1993 proposal also proposed methods that use
other analytical techniques, and improved laboratory efficiency by allowing all sulfate methods to be used for both
secondary and unregulated contaminant monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today EPA is proposing methods that use colorimetric, gravimetric or ion chromatographic analytical techniques.
The methods are proposed for analysis of sulfate as regulated and as a secondary contaminant. For information on the
precision and accuracy of these methods, EPA refers readers to the references in Table 4.

EPA is not proposing turbidimetric methods because the methods are inadequate. The operating range of turbidimetric
methods is 0 to 40 mg/L, which requires excessive dilution of the sample to cover the range between the SMCL (250 mg/L)
and the proposed MCL (500 mg/L). EPA recommends that compliance samples not be diluted more than four or five-fold
to obtain reliable and reproducible results. The gravimetric and colorimetric chromatographic methods require
acceptable dilution of the sample to measure samples containing more than 350 mg/L of sulfate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Colorimetric and gravimetric methods have been used for many years to measure sulfate in water, and were described
in the July 1990 proposal. As stated in the July 1992 rule, EPA agrees with comments that only methylthymol blue, not
chloranilate, colorimetric methods are suitable for sulfate analysis. Therefore, EPA is only proposing methylthymol
blue colorimetric methods for sulfate analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ion chromatographic methods have been approved for measurement of nitrate and nitrite (40 CFR 141.23) in drinking
water. These methods have been described or discussed in the July 1990 and the December 1993 proposals, and in 54 FR
22097 (May 22, 1989). EPA is proposing ion chromatographic methods for sulfate analysis only with the suppressed
column option. EPA has no data to support use of a ``non-suppressed'' column (57 FR 31800), and the Agency is not proposing
to approve this option in any ion chromatographic method. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes the proposed analytical methods are technologically and economically feasible for sulfate monitoring.
The analytical cost for sulfate is $10 to $30 per sample. EPA believes these costs are affordable. Actual analytical
costs may vary with the laboratory, analytical technique selected, the total number of samples and other factors.
The number of laboratories that routinely participate in EPA's Water Supply and Water Pollution performance evaluation
studies indicates that many laboratories have the capability to conduct analysis for sulfate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sulfate has a long history as a water quality parameter. There is a large body of performance data available for water
pollution studies. The proposed analytical methods have detection limits much lower than the proposed MCLG for sulfate.
The detection limit for a given contaminant varies with the analytical method (Table 5).

chemistry data into regulation development. The PQL yields a limit on measurement and identifies specific precision
and accuracy requirements which EPA uses to develop regulatory requirements. As such, PQLs are a regulatory device
rather than a standard that labs must specifically demonstrate they can meet. The PQLs for inorganic compounds are
determined based on the method detection limits (MDLs) and the results from performance evaluation data.

The PQL for sulfate was determined using the MCL as well as EPA and State laboratory data from Water Pollution PE studies
using the procedure described in 54 FR 22100 (May 22, 1989). A PQL of 10 mg/L was proposed for sulfate in the Phase V proposed
rule (55 FR 30411, July 25, 1990). Since the detection limit using the colorimetric method is 3 mg/L, EPA is soliciting
comment on whether a higher PQL of 30 mg/L should be set in order to retain the colorimetric method.

d. Laboratory certification.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Today EPA is proposing that only certified laboratories be allowed to analyze samples for compliance with the proposed
MCL for sulfate. EPA recognizes that the effectiveness of today's proposed regulations depends on the ability of
laboratories to reliably analyze contaminants at low levels. EPA has a drinking water laboratory certification
program that States must adopt as a part of primacy. (40 CFR 142.10(b)) EPA's Manual for the Certification of Laboratories
Analyzing Drinking Water, EPA/570/9-90/008, April, 1990, specifies minimum criteria which States must use to implement
their drinking water laboratory certification program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Performance evaluation (PE) samples are an important tool in EPA's laboratory certification program. The samples
are provided by EPA or the States to laboratories seeking certification. To obtain and maintain certification a laboratory
must use an approved method, and at least once a year successfully analyze an appropriate PE sample. Successful analysis
requires that a laboratory report a concentration of sulfate in the PE-sample that is within the acceptance limits.
Specification of these proposed limits, which are listed in drinking water regulations at &sect;141.23(k), is discussed
below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e. Setting PE sample acceptance limits for sulfate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Acceptable performance has historically been set by EPA using two different approaches: (1) Regressions from performance
of preselected laboratories (using 95 percent confidence limits), or (2) specified accuracy requirements. Acceptance
limits based on specified accuracy requirements are developed from existing PE study data. When there are insufficient
PE data to determine expected laboratory performance, EPA determines acceptance limits from individual study statistics
based upon 95 percent confidence limits. After sufficient performance data are generated from PE studies, EPA will
develop fixed acceptance limits using a ``plus or minus of the true value approach.'' The true value approach requires
each laboratory to demonstrate its ability to perform within pre-defined limits. Laboratory performance is evaluated
using a constant yardstick independent of performance achieved by other laboratories participating in the same
study. A fixed criterion based on a percent error around the ``true'' value reflects the experience obtained from
numerous laboratories and includes relationships of the accuracy and precision of the measurement to the concentration
of the analyte. It also assumes little or no bias in the analytical methods that may result in average reporting values
different from the reference ``true'' value. This concept assures that reported results can be related to the percentage
variance from the PQL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Performance data are available for sulfate at concentrations proposed for regulation. The data are sufficient to
set fixed acceptance limits of

a. Today's Proposed MCL.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Today EPA is proposing an MCL for sulfate of 500 mg/L, which is equal to the proposed MCLG. EPA believes that costs for
large systems are reasonable and affordable, and that it is technologically feasible for PWSs to achieve this level
for sulfate. EPA also believes that the flexibility afforded by Option 1 allows small systems to comply with the MCL
in a way that is reasonable and affordable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examination of the BATs identified above (RO, IE, and ED) indicates that each can reduce the levels of sulfate from
the maximum expected occurrence levels to levels below the proposed MCLG of 500 mg/L (minimum removal efficiencies
of 86%, 75%, and 80%, respectively). The maximum reported occurrence level for sulfate in a national study (RWS) is
1,000 mg/L, although individual State data have shown levels twice as high. Each of these technologies is currently
available, has been installed in PWSs, is compatible with other water treatment processes, and can remove sulfate
from the maximum occurrence level to below the proposed MCLG. EPA is proposing an MCL for sulfate based upon an analysis
of several factors, including:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The effectiveness of BAT in reducing sulfate levels from influent concentrations to the MCLG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The feasibility (including costs) of applying BAT. EPA considered the availability of the technology and the
costs of installation and operation for large systems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The performance of available analytical methods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
b. Lead option for implementing the MCL requirement.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As described in the Regulatory Background section, EPA determined that sulfate is found primarily in small PWSs in
the western part of the U.S., and that compliance with the sulfate MCL would place a significant burden on these systems.
EPA decided that a requirement for PWSs to comply with the sulfate MCL by treating all of their source water might be
excessive since high sulfate levels affect only persons who are not acclimated to the water. Therefore, the Agency
decided in 1992 to defer the regulation for sulfate in order to consider ways of allowing PWSs to comply with the MCL
that would not require central treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To develop alternative options for complying with the MCL, EPA held a meeting with interested States and the Association
of State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA). In November 1992, officials from Texas, South Dakota, Colorado,
and New Mexico, ASDWA staff, EPA Regional staff, and EPA Headquarters staff met to explore regulatory options for
sulfate. They discussed the regulatory process, a toxicological profile of sulfate, and State perspectives on sulfate
regulation, health effects and implementation options. Neither the issue of whether or not to regulate sulfate nor
the MCL/MCLG levels were topics of discussion. The participants felt that the sulfate regulation should give the
States flexibility. After the discussions at this meeting, most of the States present supported the conclusion that
PWSs should be allowed to protect their customers from the risk of sulfate levels exceeding the MCL either by centralized
treatment or through public education/notification and provision of Alternative Water. The outline of a regulatory
option that included all of these elements was formulated. Each of the components was directed at a certain population
and the majority agreed that those components, together, would be adequately protective. The option developed at
that meeting is essentially Option 1, being proposed today. In the past, EPA has not generally set restrictions or
conditions on the means of compliance with the MCL. Traditionally, EPA simply identifies the central treatment technologies
that are considered BAT and then sets the MCL based on the capabilities of those technologies to remove the contaminant.
PWSs are not required to use the identified BATs but must achieve compliance with the MCL. EPA regulations prohibit
PWSs from using bottled water or POU devices to achieve compliance with the MCL. In addition, the regulations prohibit
PWSs from using POE devices to achieve compliance with the MCL unless the PWS meets certain conditions for ensuring
effective protection of all consumers. See 40 CFR 141.100 and 141.101. In Option 1, EPA proposes to override the general
prohibition on the use of bottled water and POU/POE devices and to allow States to authorize PWSs to use these methods
to achieve compliance with the MCL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
c. Method of compliance.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State would have the authority under Option 1 to allow PWSs to achieve compliance with the sulfate MCL by one of two
methods. The PWS could comply either by using conventional central treatment or by providing Alternative Water.
With the State's authorization, PWSs would have the choice of supplying bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs,
POU or POE devices to target populations. Under Option 1, PWSs that provide Alternative Water would also need to meet
certain public education/notification requirements. Transient systems would also have to provide Alternative
Water, but their public notification requirement would be posting of signs, unless POE/POU devices brought all taps
into compliance. This approach directly focuses protection on the sensitive populations: Infants, travelers and
new residents. Under Option 1, any program developed by a PWS would need to contain the following provisions or others
which it can demonstrate are at least as stringent and protective:

(1) Community Water Systems
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Bottled water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PWSs would need to provide and deliver two liters of bottled water per person per day (unless the customer requests
less), on request, to households with infants, new residents, or transients (visitors). The bottled water would
have to have been monitored or certified to be in compliance with all EPA MCLs. PWSs would be allowed to deliver enough
water for several weeks, or the entire time period, at once, and would not be required to provide daily delivery. Infants,
up to one year old, would receive bottled water for a maximum of 20 weeks from the date of request. Since a mother may nurse
her infant during the first year, it would be her decision as to when to begin giving the infant tap water. Each new resident
(person moving to the high-sulfate community from another location) would receive bottled water for a maximum of
six weeks. New residents with infants up to one year old would receive bottled water for their infant for 20 weeks. New
residents with infants older than one year would receive bottled water for themselves and their infant for six weeks.
Since new residents would be informed about the Alternative Water by the PWS at the time of starting water service to
their residence, the six weeks would begin at that time. Travelers (guests visiting residents and hotel guests) would
receive bottled water for the period requested, not to exceed six weeks. In resident households with infants, the
public water system would only need to supply bottled water for the infant in the household. EPA is not proposing to
require that bottled water be provided to resident pregnant women prior to childbirth, since there seems to be no transfer
of sulfate through the placenta.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule would require PWSs supplying Alternative Water to determine an equitable way of recouping their expenses
in providing that service without charging a premium to the recipients of the Alternative Water. EPA believes that
an additional charge for Alternative Water (above and beyond what would normally be charged for the water if it had
been delivered through the distribution system) would be a disincentive to a consumer's decision to request Alternative
Water and receive protection from high levels of sulfate. Therefore, the proposed rule would prohibit PWSs from charging
a premium. The Agency believes this is necessary in order to ``assure a supply of drinking water which dependably complies
with'' the sulfate MCL (see SDWA Section 1401(1)(D)). Each utility would need to determine the best way to meet its
operating expenses without imposing a premium on the subpopulation of customers that is receiving Alternative Water
under the sulfate rule. For example, a PWS could charge the same unit cost for each liter of bottled water as it charges
for centrally-distributed water. The number of liters of bottled water delivered to a household would simply be added
to the number of liters of centrally-distributed water that appears on the meter, and the same unit cost would apply
to the entire volume. EPA requests comment on whether it is appropriate to restrict the PWS's fee structure in this
way. In particular, the Agency is interested in whether there are State or local ratemaking laws or other laws that
bear on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two liters per day is the amount of water selected to be provided since that is the consumption level used by EPA in calculating
risk estimates, and is the 85th percentile consumption level of water for the U.S. population. Infants are considered
to consume one liter per day, but since they comprise a small portion of the target population, two liters per day for
all members of the target population is retained for simplicity of implementation. Twenty weeks was chosen as the
period for providing bottled water to infants since EPA staff scientists believe that this is a sufficiently lengthy
period for infants to become gradually acclimated to high sulfate-containing water. Similarly, six weeks was chosen
as the period for providing bottled water to new residents and travelers (guests) to allow gradual acclimation. Although
two weeks is the period necessary to acclimate to high sulfate levels if a person is exposed continually to high-sulfate
water, this rapid time frame would require the person to experience the adverse effect. In addition, new residents
and travelers are likely to have many activities occupying their attention which may prevent them from accomplishing
the acclimation in a shorter time period. EPA is requesting comment on these allotted time periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notice provided to customers by the PWS would advise that during the period when bottled water is provided, there
should be mixing of bottled water with tap water to allow gradual acclimation of the digestive system to the high-sulfate
water. If gradual introduction of tap water is not done, there could still be adverse health effects when use of bottled
water ceases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PWS would be responsible for providing bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs on request to any household which
has an infant or travelers (guests), and to any household with new residents who have moved to the community from outside
the service area.

Monitoring requirements to ensure that the bottled water meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate MCL and other MCLs are explained in the section below on Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monitoring Requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PWSs would need to maintain a record of public requests for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottled water, either by a telephone log or other means, by which the date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the request and the date of delivery are recorded and maintained for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State verification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the public notification is done effectively, it is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated that emergency delivery of bottled water will be necessary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Customers should have the time to notify the PWS well in advance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
desired delivery date. In the event that a customer has not had access to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public notification and is unable to procure bottled water prior to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal delivery by the PWS, the PWS should have the ability to provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency delivery within 24 hours of receiving the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Public Education/Notification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public education and public notification are important in making 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people aware of the potential adverse health effects of high levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate and educating them about how to protect themselves if they are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the targeted population. For CWSs, there are four components to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed public education and public notification requirement: Notices in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bills, pamphlets, signs and notices to the media. In communities where a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant portion of the population speaks a language other than English, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the text would need to be in the appropriate language(s), in addition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
English. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notices in Bills. PWSs would be required to use their bill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notices to inform residents of the sulfate content in their water and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential impact on non-acclimated persons. The compliance requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mail delivery would be the same as those for the general public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification mail delivery requirements in &sect;141.32(a) (2) and (3), except 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the interval for sulfate notification is proposed to be every six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months rather than three months. EPA is proposing to specify a six-month 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interval to assure that a pregnant woman would receive at least one notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the term of her pregnancy. The notice would have to be typed in bold 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lettering on the bill itself. There would also need to be an additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
page with more information on the potential health effect from ingesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high levels of sulfate in drinking water. That page would include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information about how expectant mothers and residents can request and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
receive bottled water for infants and guests, how to mix tap water with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottled water over time to gradually acclimate the person to sulfate, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as a section reassuring the consumer that there are no ill effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from high sulfate-containing water for residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PWS would also need to provide the same notice to new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customers or billing units prior to or at the time service begins. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pamphlets. PWSs would be required to provide pamphlets to all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medical facilities, which includes, but is not limited to city, county and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State health departments, pharmacies, public and private hospitals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clinics, family planning clinics and local welfare agencies. The PWS would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to request that the operators of those facilities make the pamphlets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to pregnant women. The pamphlets would contain the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed above for notices in bills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Signs. PWSs would be required to post permanent, prominent and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visible signs in all public areas where not all taps will have treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notices to the Media. PWSs would be required to submit copies of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the notice described above to radio and television stations that broadcast 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the community served by the water system when sulfate in excess of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCL has been detected in the water, and once every six months while the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water delivered into the distribution system exceeds the sulfate MCL. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographical service area in question would have to be indicated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clearly defined in the notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Transient Systems and Non-Transient, Non-Community Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Bottled Water and POU/POE Devices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Transient systems, which comprise most of the affected systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1,200 of 1,950), and non-transient, non-community systems would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to make either bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs or water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated with a POU/POE device available for travelers at establishments in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the service area. Where the target population is affected on a relatively 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continual basis, PWSs may find it more cost-effective to provide POU or POE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices. Where the system rarely serves members of the target population, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it might choose to have a supply of bottled water on hand. Non-transient, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-community water systems, such as schools, factories and hospitals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might choose to install POEs in their cafeterias. PWSs would be responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for maintaining POU/POE devices to ensure their continuing effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Public Education/Notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public notification for transient systems and non-transient, non-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community systems would be posting of signs. Such systems have no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customers to ``bill'', and notices to the media and pamphlets would not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective or necessary. PWSs would be required to post permanent, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prominent and visible signs, made of durable material such as plastic, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
places such as rest areas, campgrounds, gas stations and public areas. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signs would target travelers and newcomers, and would alert the public to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the health effects of sulfate and the nearest location of drinking water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for individuals not acclimated to high sulfate levels. The signs would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have to be placed in any location where all taps (i.e., faucets, fountains, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or other source of water that could be used for drinking) are not providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water in compliance with the sulfate MCL. If the location has a POE 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
device, posting would not be necessary, since all taps would provide water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that complies with the MCL. In the case of campgrounds, sources such as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hand pumps or trailer hook-ups would be posted with signs, and bottled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water could be available at the entrance gate or registration area. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency recognizes that there are unmanned, remote campgrounds in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national parks system, and requests comment on the means of compliance for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sanctioning of Alternative Water as a means of compliance is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an innovative approach that EPA has developed in recognition of the special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances and concerns surrounding the sulfate regulation. The proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option would provide Alternative Water to sensitive populations only for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the period of time needed for acclimation. The Alternative Water approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is appropriate in this case because the target populations are readily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifiable and because their need is short-term. Option 1 provides PWSs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility and seeks to alleviate the financial burden that central 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment might entail for small PWSs, and as such is in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the objectives of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that the requirements of Option 1 for PWSs to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottled water which complies with EPA MCLs or POU/POE devices and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide public notice and education, taken together, will assure a supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of drinking water to the Target Population which dependably complies with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the MCL for sulfate (see SDWA Section 1401(1)(D).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As detailed below in the section on costs, EPA finds that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative Water approach would result in an annual national cost of $86 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million annually, as compared to an annual cost for central treatment by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all affected systems of $147 million. The $86 million estimate would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantially lower except that EPA assumed conservatively that about 25% 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of affected systems would choose central treatment or regionalization even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Option 1 available to them. Of the $86 million, $7 million would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cost to the 1,500 systems choosing the public notification/Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water method of compliance, and $71 million would be the cost to the 500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems choosing central treatment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To understand how the logistics of the option would work, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency chose two system sizes: A PWS serving a town of 500 people, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another serving a town of 3,300 people. As very few systems (approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40) serving 3,300 people or more are expected to exceed the sulfate MCL, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this system size was chosen to illustrate that it would be more cost-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective for a system of that size to centrally treat. Costs were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated by using national averages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In a population of 500, the Agency assumed (based on analysis of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U.S. Census Bureau and Current Population Reports data) that there would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eight households (500 times 1.68%) with infants and 30 households with new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents (500 times 16.4% divided by 2.6 persons per household) at any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given time. (EPA assumed that an average household contains 2.6 people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New residents and infants would require Alternative Water for 6 weeks and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 weeks, respectively. A system serving this population of 500 would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to deliver a maximum of approximately 8,800 liters of bottled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water annually, or 24 liters per day, as illustrated by the calculations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Total Annual Bottled Water Needs=8,792 liters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Average Daily Bottled Water Needs 8,792/365 days=24 liters 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The above calculation is given as an example only, and the 24-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liter figure is a high estimate. The required mixing of tap water with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottled water over time for infants and new residents would reduce their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption of bottled water. The cost analysis in the RIA for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking assumes that bottled water will represent, on average, half the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water consumption for infants and new residents, and that customers will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercise their option to have less than 2 liters per day delivered over the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entire period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although it is up to the water system to decide how to deliver the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water, the Agency finds that the system could contract the delivery service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
out to a bottled water supplier or could procure and distribute bottled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water itself. For the sake of simplifying the model, EPA assumed that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
town with a population of 500 would not have to install any POUs or POEs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and would rely entirely on bottled water for the target population. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency recognizes that, in actuality, some percentage of such towns may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have a restaurant and/or gas station, and could use a POU/POE device. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, these towns would be few in number, and the simplified model is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retained for costing purposes only. If such a town had very few travelers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passing through, for example, a restaurant or gas station might find it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more cost-effective to use permanent signs and have bottled water available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for those few travelers. EPA assumes that systems which rarely serve the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
target population would comply by posting signs and having bottled water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for visitors, rather than install POE/POU devices. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicits comment on the types of Alternative Water that PWSs would choose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For a town with a population of 3300, the logistics become more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complicated. The estimated number of households with infants increases from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8 to 55. The number of households with new residents becomes 210, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of liters of bottled water to be delivered per day is approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
170. It is also estimated that there will be 3 POU units per town. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency thinks that few PWSs serving populations this large will choose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 1, and will choose instead to centrally treat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several disadvantages to Option 1. First, it requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons to learn about sulfate and take action to protect themselves. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, because high-sulfate water is still available at the tap, Option 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not guarantee that all target audiences will be protected. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comment on the feasibility, equity, enforceability, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attractiveness of the option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA believes that allowing compliance with the MCL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through the use of POUs, POEs, and bottled water is acceptable in the case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of sulfate, the Agency continues to believe that it should not be allowed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the case of other drinking water contaminants, for which the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibitions in 40 CFR 141.100 and 141.101 still would apply. Option 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to override the prohibition in these sections against using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottled water and POU devices as a means of compliance with the sulfate MCL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of its unique characteristics. The susceptible population is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited, and the health effects are short-lived, so the logistics of Option 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 are feasible for smaller systems. The effects are immediate, so the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause/effect relationship of drinking water containing high levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate can be easily demonstrated, and the affected population can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readily convinced of the need for precautions. EPA is unaware of any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drinking water contaminant having these unique features. Therefore, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers Alternative Water and public notification/education to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable means for compliance with the MCL for sulfate, but not for other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants, given current information on health risk and treatment costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the burden of administering Alternative Water in larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems, noncompliance and the difficulties of enforcement become larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns. Therefore, EPA considered, but decided against, limiting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of Option 1 to smaller systems (e.g., systems serving fewer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 3,300 persons). Such a limitation would be unlikely to have any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practical effect since, for cost efficiency reasons, systems above this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size would probably choose central treatment. Also, EPA's occurrence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projections indicate that few if any systems above 3,300 are likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceed a sulfate MCL of 500 mg/L.

Other options being considered.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Option 1 above is EPA's preferred approach to regulating sulfate in drinking water and is being proposed by EPA today.
EPA believes that Option 1 fully complies with SDWA's scheme for establishing drinking water regulations and is the
best approach for regulating sulfate. However, there has been considerable discussion as to the necessity for federal
regulatory action in protecting the public from the real, yet temporary laxative effect of sulfate. Various commentors
on the 1990 proposal argued that sulfate should not be regulated at all because diarrhea does not present a significant
risk to health, but rather is only an inconvenience.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has a statutory requirement to regulate sulfate. In light of the above comments, EPA is seriously considering
the following additional options for regulating sulfate. EPA solicits public comment and scientific evidence on
all of the options being considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 2&blank;Under this option, the sulfate MCL and MCLG would be set at 500 mg/L. However, the target population
would be limited to only infants, that is, only infants would need to be provided drinking water that meets the MCL for
sulfate. The rationale for this option is that infants are the only population subgroup potentially subject to a significant
risk to health, not due to the initial effect (diarrhea), but due to their inability to modify their environment or
fluid intake, and the possibility that dehydration could occur if no action is taken. Under this Option, EPA would
be taking the position that the laxative effect is more of an inconvenience than an adverse health effect in adults,
and that no protection of adults is necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The implementation of Option 2 would require the same public notification/education activities outlined in Option
1, with modifications in the text to limit the target population to infants. The text would state that only infants
are exposed to significant risk from sulfate ingestion. Just as in Option 1, CWSs in excess of the sulfate MCL would
be required to provide notices in bills, signs, pamphlets and media notices to their customers in the service area.
These CWSs would be required to deliver Alternative Water upon request to households with infants for a maximum of
20 weeks during their first year of life. Transient systems and non-transient, non-community systems would be required
to post signs and assure a supply of bottled water for infants if there is any possibility of an infant being present
at the facility. Since the target population is comprised only of infants, the allocation of bottled water would be
1 liter per day, rather than the 2 liters per day proposed under Option 1 for adults and infants. For costing purposes,
the Agency assumes that under Option 2, no PWS would choose central treatment as a means of compliance. This assumption
is based on the relatively small number of infants (less than 2% of a given population) and the option's relatively
low administrative and logistical costs. The cost of arranging delivery of bottled water and providing public notification
in the service area would be lower than the cost of installing central treatment. However, it is possible that a large
PWS, in anticipation of future regulations for other contaminants, or to comply with other existing regulations
for contaminants that can be removed by the same treatment technologies as sulfate (e.g., RO), might, in reality,
choose central treatment. Such a system may find the permanent requirement to provide public notification and bottled
water to the target population to be a long-term administrative burden that is ultimately less cost-effective than
central treatment. A disadvantage to this option is the possible precedent that would be set by an EPA statement that
diarrhea is not considered an adverse effect for adults.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 3&blank;Option 3 differs from Option 2 in the definition of the targetpopulation. The target population would
be composed, as in Option 1, of infants and transient adults (including new residents), all of whom are subject to the
adverse effect. However, unlike Option 1, there would be two different strategies under Option 3 to protect the two
target population subgroups, infants and adults. As in Option 2, Alternative Water would have to be provided for infants.
Unlike Option 2 however, PWSs would be required to notify transient adults of their risk, even though not required
to provide them with Alternative Water. Public education/notification requirements would be identical to those
described for Option 1 for both subgroups, except that the text of the notices would state that Alternative Water is
only provided for infants upon request of the parent. Just as in Option 2, CWSs exceeding the sulfate MCL would be required
to provide notices in bills, signs, pamphlets and media notices to their customers in the service area, and deliver
bottled water upon request to households with infants for a maximum of 20 weeks. Similarly, transient and non-transient,
non-community systems would be required to post signs and maintain a supply of bottled water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rationale for Option 3 is that it is necessary to set the MCL at a protective level, but sufficient for compliance
purposes to provide notification/education to the affected adult population. This option is based on the theory
that adequate protection for adults can be achieved through proper education and notification. Informed adults
would be able to reduce or avoid the effect by taking the initiative to purchase bottled water or otherwise abstain
from drinking tap water. Infants, on the other hand, depend on adults for their survival, and the minimization of diarrhea's
effects depends on the adult's gradual mixing of the infant's tap water with water that complies with the sulfate MCL.
Consequently, more stringent requirements (provision of Alternative Water) would be imposed to ensure protection
of infants. The disadvantage of this option is that it requires members of the affected public to protect themselves
after being notified of a potential risk.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Implications of Options 1, 2 and 3.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Options 1, 2 and 3 represent a significant change from the Agency's approach in other drinking water regulations.
The principal advantage to these options is the reduced cost to systems. However, there are potential disadvantages
in terms of policy implications to adopting any of these options which should be addressed and debated with public
participation. EPA recognizes that there may be concern over the decision not to require PWSs to treat their water
centrally but to allow them to supply water at levels that may exceed the sulfate MCL, and to rely on the provision of
Alternative Water at the consumer's end to ensure ultimate compliance. A disadvantage of these three options is that
it is possible that some members of sensitive subpopulations may still drink untreated tap water from the distribution
system and thus, not be protected. Consumers may be unaware of the need to request Alternative Water, or may find it
too burdensome to do so. While EPA believes that this strategy conforms with the requirements and intent of the Safe
Drinking Water Act, EPA requests comment on this issue.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Options 1, 2 and 3 also require more assertive action by the public to ensure protection, especially those served by
a CWS. This is true for Option 1, where adults in the target population would be required to contact the CWS for Alternative
Water, which would then be delivered. Even more assertive action is needed for Option 3, since informed adults would
have to obtain Alternative Water themselves. For Options 2 and 3, in transient systems, an adult wishing Alternative
Water might not readily find it, as there would be no requirement to have it available, except for infants. The Agency
is requesting comment on whether this need for assertive action would be appropriate, or whether such a strategy is
reasonable, given the unique aspects of sulfate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 2 is based on the premise that diarrhea is not an adverse effect in adults. Until now, the Agency has considered
some effects as adverse which, by themselves, are not harmful, but are precursors of adverse effects. Examples are
(a) developmental effects, such as an extra embryonic rib which is later resorbed; (b) benign tumors; (c) reduction
in maternal weight gain, even with no observable fetal effect; and (d) marginal cholinesterase inhibition. In comparison
to these effects, the long-term effects of sulfate ingestion appear to be nil, and acclimation occurs in a short period
of time. The other effects mentioned are only detected with scientific measurement, while diarrhea or loose stools
are readily observed by the person ingesting sulfate. EPA requests comment on whether transient bouts of diarrhea
should be considered an adverse health effect or simply an inconvenience in adults.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, EPA requests comment on whether, given the available information, a conclusion can be made that experiencing
transient bouts of diarrhea resulting from ingestion of sulfate in drinking water is not an adverse effect in any segment
of the population (adults or infants) within the meaning of the Safe Drinking Water Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also recognizes that the provisions of this regulation are more difficult to enforce than central treatment.
Indeed, it is for similar reasons that EPA has always prohibited Alternative Water as a means of compliance. While
PWSs already have the legal option to use a POE device to comply with any MCL if certain requirements are followed, the
requirements for using bottled water or POU devices have been applicable only to temporary situations to prevent
unreasonable risk to health. Adoption of any of the proposed options would also mean that individuals in the target
population would drink bottled water on a temporary basis. However, the extent to which bottled water quality (i.e.,
compliance with all MCLs) can be assured varies from State to State. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which
is responsible for overseeing bottled water quality, is continuing to adopt standards which ensure truthful labeling.
However, production and sales of bottled water have increased dramatically in recent years, and FDA does not have
a complete inventory of domestic bottled water plants. FDA inspects the known plants, on average, every three to four
years, or more frequently if problems arise (GAO, 1992). A few States have stricter standards than FDA (NY, CA, PA,
CT) and require all bottled water plants to register with the State and conform to State requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, POU devices are not subject to EPA certification. Since the proposed rule gives the States full authority
to decide whether or not an alternative option would be allowed, each State would presumably base its decision on the
extent to which it believes implementation is practicable. EPA requests comment on whether it is appropriate to allow
use of bottled water and POU devices for sulfate MCL compliance.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Option 4.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the proposed option (1) and its variations (2) and (3) represent a significant change in regulatory approach,
and in order to fully consider the issues raised, EPA considered another, more conventional option. Option 4 was considered
in the event EPA determines that Alternative Water may not be as effective as central treatment in enabling small systems
to comply with the sulfate MCL. Option 4 would not directly allow the use of Alternative Water as a means of compliance
with the MCL.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Option 4, systems would need to obtain a variance from the sulfate MCL under the provisions of SDWA section 1415.
As a condition of receiving a variance, systems would be required to provide Alternative Water to their target populations,
just as in Option 1. Therefore, the relief under Option 4 would be similar to the relief under Option 1 but would be provided
through a different statutory mechanism.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In Option 4, central treatment would be designated as section 1412 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAT. Central treatment would be considered economically feasible despite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the financial difficulties presented to small systems, because the SDWA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legislative history indicates Congress' desire that economic feasibility be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 1415 (and corresponding State laws) provide that systems

technology. However, section 1415 also states that the EPA Administrator

may vary the technologies identified as BAT for purposes of section 1415 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variances ``depending on the number of persons served by the system or for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other physical conditions related to engineering feasibility and costs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with [MCLs] as considered appropriate by the Administrator.'' As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a key component of Option 4, EPA would designate Alternative Water along 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with central treatment as BAT for purposes of section 1415 variances only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A PWS that is granted a variance would also be required to meet all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of Option 1 for public education/notification and provision of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative Water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative Water would be designated as a section 1415 BAT because of the special need to provide bottled water which
complies with EPA MCLs only to targeted populations for a limited time, which represents a special ``physical condition
related to engineering feasibility'' under section 1415. To protect public health from the adverse effects of sulfate,
it is necessary to protect only these specific subpopulations (infants, travelers, and new residents). It is technically
infeasible to direct treated water only to those households containing these subpopulations, particularly when
various households contain sensitive subpopulations at different times. However, it is technically feasible to
direct public education and notification and Alternative Water only to those homes which require it. To treat water
going to households with sensitive subpopulations would require a PWS to treat all water. The cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing treated water to everyone could be much higher than the PWS would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise have to incur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 4 would require administrative involvement by the State in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing variance applications. The additional administrative burden is a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clear disadvantage of this option, especially because many State agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administering the drinking water program currently have significant funding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and resource problems. On the other hand, a scheme based on individually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
granted variances might be considered more desirable in that each PWS would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to justify to the State its individual plan for providing Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States may also choose to grant variances in a block to many PWSs at a time, thus reducing their own administrative burden.
However, the burden would remain on each system to make an application and present the details of its program to the
State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above with respect to Option 1, EPA has decided not to limit the availability of variances based
on Alternative Water under Option 4 to smaller systems. The public education/notification requirements discussed
under Option 1 would apply to those systems receiving a variance under Option 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Making relief available to small systems only through variances presents some additional statutory constraints
compared to Option 1. First, variances are only available at the discretion of the State. The State is free not to grant
variances or to issue them under more stringent conditions than set by EPA. For sulfate, based on the prior State comments
and input, States are seeking flexibility and relief for small systems and, therefore, might generally be expected
not to be more stringent on variances than EPA. On the other hand, it is unclear whether States will be dissuaded from
providing many variances by the administrative burdens presented by Option 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, under section 1415, variances are available only where the State finds that they will not result in an unreasonable
risk to health (``URTH''). However, EPA does not believe that this constraint will present any problems since, as
a condition of receiving the variance, PWSs will be required to supply Alternative Water that complies with the sulfate
MCL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, section 1415 requires the State to prescribe with the variance a schedule for compliance with the MCL. In this
case, by providing Alternative Water to qualify for the variance, the PWS would in fact be supplying water that meets
the MCL. Therefore, EPA believes it is not necessary or appropriate to prescribe any further schedules for achieving
compliance with the sulfate MCL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA also notes that SDWA section 1415 provides for variances where a system cannot meet the MCL because of
characteristics of the raw water source. Here, the raw water source is not the issue; application of Alternative Water
as section 1415 BAT would achieve the MCL but would be considered not as effective as central treatment in ensuring
a consistent and reliable supply of water at the MCL. EPA nevertheless believes that Option 4 is consistent with the
purposes and intent of SDWA section 1415, but requests comment on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an additional option, EPA considered whether relief to small systems could be provided through exemptions under
SDWA section 1416. This does not appear to be a viable approach, however. Unlike section 1415, section 1416 does not
authorize EPA to vary its designation of BAT for purposes of exemptions. Instead, to qualify for indefinite exemptions,
section 1415 envisions that small systems will be continuously working toward obtaining the financing necessary
to install the BAT technologies identified under section 1412 (i.e., central treatment). Therefore, exemptions
do not appear to be an appropriate mechanism for providing relief from the sulfate MCL to small systems. EPA solicits
comment on whether exemptions do provide a mechanism for relief.

g. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Additional option.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Agency requests comment on the feasibility and appropriateness of the Options discussed above. The Agency is
also considering an additional option, namely the traditional approach of simply relying on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
central treatment as BAT for all systems, with no special provisions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relief for small systems. The advantages to central treatment are that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is the easiest approach to enforce, and it is consistent with the Agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory approach for other contaminants. The disadvantages are that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is costly and would not provide flexibility or relief for small systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, under this option, drinking water that meets the sulfate MCL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would need to be provided to all consumers even though only a small percentage of the population would experience adverse
health effects from ingesting sulfate. Also, the Agency has concerns that this option would not be economically feasible
for small systems, as discussed in section IV 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below. Accordingly, this option is not being offered as the preferred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option in today's notice, but EPA is still considering it, and it has the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential to be adopted in the final rule. This option would be adopted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for example, if it appears that the other options would be inadequate to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assure a supply of drinking water that dependably complies with the sulfate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCL (see &sect;1401(1)(D) because members of the target population would fail to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take appropriate action to protect themselves from an acute but temporary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse health effect. The total national cost of this option would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identical to that for Option 4 ($147 million, see Table 8), since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic analysis assumed that all systems would choose central treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Option 4. Similarly, the household cost for this option would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identical to those for Option 4 (Table 9). The Agency requests comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether this option, which would effectively limit methods of compliance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
central treatment, should be adopted.

5. Compliance Monitoring Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
a. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Introduction.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The proposed compliance monitoring requirements for sulfate would apply to all systems (community, non-transient
non-community, and transient non-community water systems). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The occurrence of sulfate in drinking water may be predictable based on several factors including geological conditions,
use patterns (e.g., pesticides), presence of industrial activity in the area, and type of source or historic record.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PWSs would need to monitor for sulfate in accordance with EPA's Standard Monitoring Framework (SMF), published Jan.
30, 1991 (56 FR 3564). Monitoring is done for three, three-year compliance periods in a nine-year cycle. The Phase
II regulations established a nine-year cycle for those contaminants in that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. By agreement between States and EPA at a Denver work group meeting in 1992, subsequent rules will begin their
individual nine-year cycles in the first January after the effective date (18 months after promulgation). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The monitoring requirements described in the next section are proposed to apply to systems which exceed the MCL and
are authorized by the State to select the preferred option (Option 1) to achieve compliance with the sulfate MCL. For
systems which select central treatment, or which do not exceed the MCL, the SMF is proposed to apply. If either Option
2 or Option 3 becomes the final regulation for sulfate and the State allows that method of compliance, the monitoring
requirements described for Option 1 regarding Alternative Water and the reporting/record keeping requirements
for public notification would apply for systems exceeding the sulfate MCL. Initial monitoring to determine MCL exceedence
would be required of all systems, that is, community, transient and non-transient, non-community systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Proposed monitoring requirements for sulfate.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The monitoring requirements for those systems selecting Option 1, with State authorization, would be as follows,
and are consistent with the provisions of &sect;142.62 (g) and (h). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Bottled water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are regulations in effect (&sect;142.62) which state that a PWS can be required or permitted by the State to supply
its customers with bottled water as a condition for receiving a variance or exemption. These regulations indicate
that the State shall require and approve a monitoring program for bottled water and that the PWS shall develop and put
in place a monitoring program that provides reasonable assurances that the bottled water meets all MCLs. These same
monitoring requirements are proposed to apply here. The PWS monitors a representative sample of the bottled water
for all contaminants regulated under &sect;&sect;141.61 (a) and (c) and 141.62 during the first three-month period
that it supplies the bottled water to the public, and annually thereafter. Results of the monitoring are provided
to the State annually. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State, in lieu of the above requirements, could accept certification from the bottled water company that the bottled
water supplied has come from an approved source as defined in 21 CFR 129.3(a); and that the bottled water company has
conducted monitoring in accordance with 21 CFR 129.80(g) (1) through (3); and that the bottled water does not exceed
any EPA MCLs. The PWS would have to provide certification to the State the first quarter after it supplies bottled water
and annually thereafter. At the State's option a PWS may satisfy the requirements of this subsection by citing an approved
monitoring program which is already in place in another State.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The existing regulations regarding interim use of bottled water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to avoid an unreasonable risk to health state that the PWS is fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for the provision of sufficient quantities of bottled water to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every customer via door-to-door delivery. The Option being proposed today 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Option 1) would similarly require door-to-door delivery by the PWS to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons in the target population when the sulfate MCL is exceeded. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comment on whether this door-to-door delivery requirement is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate for the sulfate rulemaking, or whether the requirements should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be more flexible. For example, several possible means of delivery might be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed. Distribution points could be authorized to stock and supply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottled water to the target population, with coupons issued to consumers in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the target population redeemable at the distribution point. PWSs supplying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottled water to households would deliver that water upon request and free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of charge, except as discussed under III.B.4.c. above. EPA requests comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the degree of flexibility needed in the mechanism for delivery of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottled water that meets the sulfate MCL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) POU/POE devices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing regulations for variance and exemption conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;142.62) also describe the requirements for allowing a PWS to use POU or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
POE devices. These regulations state that it is the responsibility of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PWS to operate and maintain the POU and/or POE treatment system. Before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
POU or POE devices are installed, the PWS obtains the primacy agent's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval of a monitoring plan which ensures that the devices provide health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection to the target population equivalent to that provided by central 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment. The PWS must apply effective technology under a State-approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan. The microbiological safety of the water must be maintained at all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
times. The State must require certification of adequate performance, field 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing, and if not included in the certification process, an engineering 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design review of the POU/POE devices. Under &sect;142.62(h), the design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of the POU/POE devices must consider the potential for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increasing concentrations of heterotrophic bacteria in water treated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activated carbon. The State must be assured that buildings connected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the system have sufficient POU or POE devices that are properly installed, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintained, and monitored such that all consumers will be protected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The existing regulations described above would be applied in both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Options 1 and 4. EPA assumes that only Options 1 and 4 would entail the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of POU/POE devices, since in Options 2 and 3, bottled water would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely be more cost-effective, given the reduced target population. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency seeks comment on whether all of these existing requirements should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be proposed in the case of sulfate MCL exceedence, or whether more flexible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements would be appropriate. For example, if recordkeeping could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate that an effective maintenance program was in place to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proper functioning of the treatment equipment and compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCL, some reduction in monitoring might be foreseen. The efficiency or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longevity of certain types of POU or POE devices might also be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Effective Dates for Initial Monitoring. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial monitoring for all systems would begin in the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January after the effective date of the rule. EPA's issuance of the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate rule is scheduled for May 1996. The effective date will be 18 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months after the promulgation of the final rule, or November of 1997. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this schedule is maintained, the initial monitoring for sulfate would begin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in January 1998 for all systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Sampling Location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed regulation, both ground water and surface water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems would take a minimum of one sample at every entry point to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution system which is representative of each well or source after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment. The number of samples a system must take will be determined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of entry points. This will make it easier to pinpoint possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated sources (wells) within a system. In both surface and ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water systems, the system shall take each sample at the same sampling point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unless conditions make another sampling point more representative of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source or treatment plant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Monitoring Frequency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surface water systems would be required to monitor annually and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground water systems would sample every three years. Systems which comply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by Option 1 would not be required to continue monitoring the water in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution system for sulfate. That water may continue to exceed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate MCL, but the PWS would be in compliance by providing Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water and public notification to target populations. However, the water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would still have to be monitored for and meet MCLs for other contaminants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Public Notice Requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA proposes that PWSs who use central treatment and who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nevertheless not in compliance with the sulfate MCL would be subject to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public notification requirements in &sect;141.32. However, the Agency recognizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that having different public education/notification requirements for those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems choosing central treatment and those choosing Option 1 may create 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confusion, and seeks comment on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For PWSs authorized by the State to use whichever option (1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 4) is promulgated in the final sulfate rule, public notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements are proposed to be those described in section III.B.4.b.3 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this Notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
State Implementation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Act provides that States may assume primary implementation and enforcement responsibilities for the PWS program
(primacy). 40 CFR part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
142 contains EPA's primacy regulations. In States or tribal governments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where EPA has direct implementation, resource constraints make it unlikely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Agency would offer the alternative options (1 through 4, whichever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is promulgated) to systems. EPA Regional Offices will, however, have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discretion to consider particular circumstances in their decision about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether or not to offer and implement the alternative option. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumes that most States with primacy would offer the alternative option, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but requests comment on this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fifty-five out of 57 jurisdictions have applied for and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
received primacy under the Act. To implement the federal regulations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drinking water contaminants, States must have legal authorities which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at least as stringent as the federal regulations. To update their programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States must comply with the requirements in 40 CFR 142.12 on revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved primacy programs. This proposal describes the regulations and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other procedures and policies States would need to adopt or have in place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to implement the new regulations for sulfate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under this proposal, States would be required to adopt the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following requirements: Modifications to &sect;141.23, Inorganic Chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sampling and Analytical Requirements, &sect;141.32, Public Notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements (i.e., mandatory health effects language to be included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public notification or violations), and &sect;141.62(b), Maximum Contaminant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Levels for Inorganic Contaminants, where sulfate has been added to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to adopting drinking water provisions no less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stringent than the federal regulations listed above, EPA is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow States to adopt certain requirements related to this regulation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
order to have their program revision application approved by EPA. This rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes to provide flexibility to the State with regard to implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the monitoring requirements for sulfate depending on whether a system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chooses central treatment or the alternative method of compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated in the final rule. In all cases, States would decide and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inform PWSs as to whether the alternative method of compliance (referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as Option 1 for simplicity) promulgated in the final sulfate rule will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowed. Specifically, States would be authorized to offer Option 1 as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means of compliance to PWSs who exceed the sulfate MCL. Under Option 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State would need to approve the monitoring plan of a PWS that chooses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Alternative Water and public education/notification as a means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance. The requirements would be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) State Primacy Requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the State program includes all the elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary for an effective and enforceable program, the State's request for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval must include a plan that each system monitor for sulfate by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of each compliance period. If the State is planning to authorize PWSs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use Option 1, it would need to submit the text of State laws requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Alternative Water and public notification/education program, and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
description of the State's plan to oversee compliance of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States planning to issue monitoring waivers would do so according to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;142.16.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) State Recordkeeping Requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State shall keep a record of PWSs choosing to use Option 1 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply. If the State has authorized Option 1, PWSs would be required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Option 4 offers relief to small systems in the form of an alternative to centralized treatment. If a system in violation
of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate MCL chooses centralized treatment but for some reason cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve compliance, the system would apply to the Primacy Agent for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance, and the conditions of the variance would be the same elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described for Option 1.

(1) Variances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1415(a)(1)(A) of the SDWA, EPA or a State with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primacy may grant variances from MCLs to those public water systems that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot comply with the MCLs because of characteristics of their water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources. At the time a variance is granted, the State must prescribe a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance schedule and may require the system to implement additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control measures. The SDWA requires that variances may only be granted to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those systems that have installed BAT (as identified by EPA). However, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited situations a system may receive a variance if it demonstrates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the BAT would only achieve a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 reduction in contamination (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;142.62(d)). Before EPA or a State issues a variance, it must find that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance will not result in an unreasonable risk to health (URTH). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general, the URTH level would reflect acute and subchronic toxicity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
short-term exposures and high carcinogenic risks for long-term exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For sulfate EPA's guidance regarding what is an URTH level is set at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
MCL because sulfate has an acute adverse health effect. For the sulfate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance, if the PWS provides public education/notification and Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water, EPA believes that the State should be able to conclude that the PWS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not be considered to exceed an URTH because those actions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered protective of public health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 1413(a)(4) of the Act, States with primacy that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choose to issue variances must do so under conditions and in a manner that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no less stringent than EPA allows under section 1415. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act permits EPA to vary the BAT established under section 1415 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from that established under section 1412 based on a number of findings such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as system size, physical conditions related to engineering feasibility, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cost of compliance. Paragraph 142.62 of this proposed rule lists the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BAT that EPA has specified under section 1415 of the Act for the purposes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of issuing variances. The variance BAT is Alternative Water and public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education/notification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Exemptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under section 1416(a), a State or EPA may grant an exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extending deadlines for compliance with a treatment technique or MCL if it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finds that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Due to compelling factors (which may include economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors), the PWS is unable to comply with the requirement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The exemption will not result in an URTH; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The system was in operation on the effective date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPDWR, or, for a system not in operation on that date, that no reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative source of drinking water is available to the new system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether to grant an exemption, EPA expects the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State to determine whether the facility could be consolidated with another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system or whether an alternative source could be developed. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compelling factor is the affordability of the required treatments. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible that very small systems may not be able to consolidate or find a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-cost treatment. EPA's analysis of cost for the proposed sulfate rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shows that, for very small systems, the cost is lower to provide public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
education/notification, and Alternative Water than to provide central 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment. Thus, EPA believes this alternative BAT is affordable for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, granting exemptions under SDWA section 1416 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not appear to be a viable approach to providing relief from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate MCL for smaller systems. Unlike section 1415 for variances, section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1416 does not authorize EPA to vary its designation of BAT for purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemptions.

A. Executive Order 12866 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact on entitlements, grants, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes a means of MCL compliance that is unique in its attempt to limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection only to the affected populations. As such, this action was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or recommendations will be documented in the public record. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA prepared a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) for this rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
titled the Regulatory Impact Analysis of Sulfate (August 30, 1994). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis used the following data, where available, for sulfate:

B. National Costs of the Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under Option 1, annualized national treatment and waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost is projected to total $86 million for the proposed MCL of 500 mg/L, of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which $8 million is estimated for monitoring and State implementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With State authorization, the 1,500 systems assumed to choose public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification/education and Alternative Water account for $7 million of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total, or about $5,000 per system. The Agency assumes that, despite the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of Option 1, 25% of the systems (approximately 500) exceeding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sulfate MCL would choose either central treatment or regionalization, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a total cost of $71 million. Possible reasons for choosing central 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment would be to avoid a permanent requirement for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification/Alternative Water provision and its associated administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and logistical costs and activities, or to comply with other existing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future regulations on other contaminants. The difference in cost to large 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems choosing central treatment rather than Option 1 is a factor of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 3 to 5. EPA assumes that this additional cost would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dissuade large systems from choosing central treatment. For costing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes, it was assumed that all transient systems not choosing central 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment would install a POE device, and all CWS and NTNC systems not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choosing central treatment would use bottled water or POU devices. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reality, the Agency recognizes that there would be a mixture of choices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
among system types, and that the choice of a POE by a small system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitutes ``central treatment'' for that system, since all water is treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the technology used for the POE would be a BAT technology such as RO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Small transient systems could legally choose a POE device under any of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed options, and since their cost cannot be counted under both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
centralized treatment and Option 1, their costs have been included under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the heading ``non-centralized treatment''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Options 2 and 3, the total cost of the rule is approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$16 million, which also includes $8 million for State implementation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring costs. The implementation of Options 2/3 would be much less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costly than Option 1, but would involve all 2,000 systems, compared to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,500 systems which would choose public notification/education and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative Water in Option 1. Consequently, the cost of implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be $8 million rather than the $7 million for Option 1. The target 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population would be reduced to infants and the water allocated reduced to 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liter per day. Although more infants would be included by large systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choosing this option, infants comprise less than 2% of the population at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any given time. The difference in cost to large systems choosing central 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment rather than Options 2/3 would be at least an order of magnitude. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA assumes that this additional cost would dissuade large systems from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
choosing central treatment, and therefore that all systems would choose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Option 1. Implementation of Options 2 and 3 would be identical, except for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the content of the public education/notification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Option 4, the total national cost of the rule is $147 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million. For costing purposes, it was assumed that all systems would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
install central treatment, rather than request a variance. For some of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smallest systems, the central treatment installed consists of a POE device, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which functions on the same principles as a treatment plant (e.g., reverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
osmosis). Since some percentage of systems would, in reality, request a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance and comply by public notification/education and Alternative Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision, the cost for Option 4 is somewhat of an overestimate. At the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
same time the cost for Option 4 is an accurate estimate of what the cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be for central treatment for all affected systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under all options, approximately 2,000 systems, most serving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations less than 500, are expected to exceed the sulfate MCL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
1. Assumptions Used To Estimate Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
For each system size category, for both ground and surface water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems, the projected number of systems with contamination above the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate proposed MCL was determined from the occurrence data. The number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems exceeding the MCL was then merged with a compliance decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
matrix, which gave the relative likelihood that a given system would choose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various treatment, compliance and waste disposal options. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For systems choosing central treatment, the resulting estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were then multiplied by the unit engineering costs, which include both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capital and O&amp;M costs. Although pre-treatment costs were included in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates, the operation of reverse osmosis by some systems with very high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influent sulfate levels may contribute to the need for additional post-treatment corrosion control to comply with
the lead and copper rule. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would likely affect only systems with influent sulfate concentrations above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
750 mg/L because more than one-third of the influent stream would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated. These costs would be added to the costs of the BAT, but would not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect EPA's conclusions on affordability because they would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insignificant compared to the overall costs of the central treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the purposes of cost estimation, the Agency assumed that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost of either POU or POE is the same. Each system is assumed to install 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
POE, since the cost of one POE is generally less than the cost of multiple 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
POU units. For example, in a gas station, a POU unit would be needed at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the men's restroom, the women's restroom and the water fountain in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public area. In this scenario, it might be cost-effective to install one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
POE unit versus three POU devices. Several sources were used to estimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the capital and O&amp;M costs for POU/POE units, including (1) ``Point-Of-Use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treatment of Drinking Water in San Ysidro, New Mexico;'' March, 1990; (2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Network for Environmental Management Studies Research Report on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Affordable Drinking Water Treatment for PWSs Contaminated by Excess Levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Natural Fluoride;'' December, 1991; and (3) ``Very Small Systems Best 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Available Technology Document;'' First Draft; September, 1993. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculations included some of the following assumptions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Laboratory costs including four bacteriological analyses and two sulfate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The replacement frequency for both the particulate filter and the carbon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
post filter is assumed to be twice per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The purchase price for the POU devices ranges from $329 to $665 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depending on the number purchased at one time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The cost for installation is assumed to be $79. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The cost for a one year maintenance service contract is assumed to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$508 per unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bottled water costs are based on data provided by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
International Bottled Water Association. The cost includes cost of water, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivery, and labor. Water is estimated at $1.06 per gallon. People are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed to consume 0.53 gallons per day. The Agency estimated 1 delivery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per week with a round trip distance of 25 miles costing $0.28 cents per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mile. The Agency also estimated one hour for each delivery at a labor rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of $14.70 per hour. For Options 2 and 3, where bottled water is provided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only to infants, the water allocation is one liter per day.

The Agency used Federal Reporting Data System (FRDS) data to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine how many people lived in an average system in each system size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category. EPA used U.S. Census Bureau population and fertility data to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate that 1.68% of the people were infants and 16.4% of the people were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new residents. Recent census data put the average number of people per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
household at 2.6. The number of travelers needing Alternative Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was derived from information from the National Travel Data Center that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are approximately 1.27 billion person-trips made nationally each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year. The number of traveling persons exposed is calculated by multiplying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the estimated 250 million people served by all water systems with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability that a traveler will visit a system with water containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate levels exceeding the MCL. The probability that a traveler will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visit such a system is calculated by dividing the resident population in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given system size category by the total resident population of all systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This value is then multiplied by the number of person trips and divided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
five (the number of person trips per year per traveler) to get the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population of exposed travelers in that size category. The resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate is that approximately 1 million travelers are exposed to sulfate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in excess of 500 mg/L. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the public education and notification requirements, the PWS is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsible for producing and delivering pamphlets according to EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public notification guidelines. The number of pamphlets needed per size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category is calculated based on the population served by the PWS. Larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population centers will contain more medical facilities. For example, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
size category 1 (25&hyph;100 people) serves 0.03% of the total population, it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is also assumed to serve 0.03% of the nation's 6,634 hospitals, 83,425 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
schools, and so on. The number of permanent signs per system is calculated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by taking the number of hotels, campgrounds, interstate rest areas, rest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rooms in restaurants and gas stations in the nation and multiplying by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent of population served by each size category. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Table 9 illustrates estimated household costs for the options

being considered. For costing purposes, it was assumed that all systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were community water systems, since transient systems do not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households. For Option 1, costs increase for systems serving populations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than 3,300 due to the fact that most of those systems would choose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
central treatment. Costs level off and decrease for systems serving 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations greater than 10,000 due to economies of scale.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency made assumptions for estimating the benefits of

care, and value of days lost to care givers, business travelers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vacationers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is estimated that approximately 1.2 million people will have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduced exposure to sulfates as a result of PWSs' compliance with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate MCL. The low and high estimates of reduced population exposure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on uncertainty in occurrence data, are 0.9 million and 1.7 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluating benefits is limited to estimating reduced population 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure because there are inadequate dose-response data to estimate cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of adverse health effects avoided. Consequently, potential benefits per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case of diarrhea avoided are estimated rather than total benefits. Exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population is usually calculated by multiplying the number of systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failing the MCL by the average population served by each system. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different approach was used for sulfate, since only unacclimated persons 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and infants are affected. The affected population is in areas served by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems with sulfate levels of 500 mg/L or more, and includes resident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infants under one year of age, travellers, including infants, of all ages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visiting the area, new residents and houseguests that stay with residents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Infants were assumed to accompany parents on pleasure trips but not on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business trips. Sources of population data were the National Travel Data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Center and the U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Reports and fertility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistics. The Agency used the 1991 census data for the number of infants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
born in a year. The number of persons exposed is calculated by multiplying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the estimated 250 million people served by all water systems with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probability that the average traveler will visit a system with elevated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate levels. The Agency used the National Travel Data Center estimate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 1.27 billion person-trips made nationally each year for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
travelers. The number of diarrhea cases avoided is based on the estimate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
person-trips because each un-acclimatized individual is assumed to face 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple exposures to sulfate and potentially contract diarrhea more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
once a year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This estimate of people exposed has uncertainty based on two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variables: the number of systems with elevated sulfate levels, and the data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to model the traveling population. The best estimate of the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
travellers and resident infants with reduced exposure to sulfate at an MCL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 500 mg/L is 1.2 million people (including 27,000 infants). A logistic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response function was used to characterize the statistical relationship 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between sulfate levels in drinking water and the probability of an exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual experiencing a laxative effect. One weakness of this approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is that it assumes that consumption of either sodium sulfate or magnesium 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate results in equivalent laxative effects. It has been reported that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
magnesium sulfate is a better purgative than sodium sulfate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uncertainty is also associated with the lack of toxicological data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the relationship between various sulfate levels and the resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laxative effect. There are insufficient data to plot a dose-response 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
function. As a result, the Agency is limiting its estimate of benefits to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an individual case basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The assumptions made in estimating benefits on a case by case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis are shown in Table 10. The value of an outpatient case in Table 10 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between $218&hyph;$273. For example, the value of a case of diarrhea in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resident infant who is not hospitalized would be $55+$11 for the doctor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and medication, plus 8 hours of the care giver's time ($19&times;8=$152), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since it is assumed the caretaker would miss work. The total value for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case is $66+$152=$218. An additional $55 would be added in the case of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a traveling infant for hotel and travel expenses lost. The range accounts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the difference between residents and travelers. The infant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitalization cases cost between $3,608 and $3,828 per case. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is requesting comment on the assumptions used in the analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits of the proposed rule.

C. Comparison to Earlier Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The 1990 proposed rule estimated the cost for central treatment to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be $65 million (excluding monitoring costs). There were assumed to be 1350 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems which would need to treat for sulfate. For this reproposal EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
updated the cost to $139 million (excluding State and monitoring costs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in cost is due to: (1) The increase in projected number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems that would exceed the sulfate MCL from 1350 to 1950, (2) change in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interest rate from 3% to 7%, and (3) updating for 1991 dollars. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the new occurrence information was taken primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the National Inorganics and Radionuclides Survey (NIRS), EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complemented that information with sampling data from New York, Utah, South 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dakota, North Dakota and New Jersey. Because of the new occurrence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, the number of systems has gone up from 1350 to 1950. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason for the increase is EPA's modification, as a result of research for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the upcoming regulation concerning the control of radionuclides in drinking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water, of the number of treatment sites per ground water system. Ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water systems frequently contain more than one site requiring treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because wells are typically not piped to a central source. EPA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated this estimation method for all systems served by ground water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Annual Burden to PWSS and States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA estimates that the cost of sulfate regulation to State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs will be $7 million per year. Table 11 illustrates the 18-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average annual national burden hours, responses and costs to PWSs and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States. Sulfate testing does not require special laboratory equipment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, it is assumed that laboratory expansion undertaken to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Phase II and Phase V regulations will largely satisfy the monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs of this rule. On the other hand, EPA recognizes that States are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to provide more technical assistance to systems than for an average 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminant because of the unique nature of Option 1. Total annual costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are estimated to be $10.6 million. The additional public reporting burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on PWSs for this collection of information is estimated to average 8.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours per response.

V. Summary of Selected Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
EPA is soliciting public comment and scientific information on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues presented in or pertaining to this proposed sulfate regulation. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular, EPA requests comments on the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Is there a correlation between sulfate concentrations, palatability and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumption of high-sulfate water by the public? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Are there new data in support of or opposing the reproposed MCLG of 500 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mg/L? Are there new data in support of a higher MCLG? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Are there data to support or refute the hypothesis that the decrease in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available water resulting from sulfate ingestion may result in dehydration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in adults or infants? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Are reverse osmosis, ion exchange and electrodialysis reversal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate technologies for sulfate removal? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Should a higher PQL of 30 mg/L be set in order to retain the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colorimetric method of analysis? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Are the allotted time periods for provision of Alternative Water, i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20 weeks for infants within the first year of life and 6 weeks for new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents and travelers, appropriate and protective? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) What should be the means of compliance for unmanned, remote campgrounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the national parks system, particularly in regard to the provision of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative Water? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) What types of Alternative Water would be likely to be chosen by public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water systems of various types and sizes? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) Are the compliance requirements, that is, Alternative Water and public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification, sufficiently protective of the sensitive population? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) Should the target population be limited just to infants, or should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there be different requirements for protecting infants and adults? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(11) Are the proposed options consistent with the purposes and intent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SDWA, and are they feasible? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(12) Is a provision to allow the water supply to exceed the sulfate MCL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while relying on public notification and self-protection appropriate under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SDWA? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(13) Is the need for assertive action on the part of the public for self-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(14) Should temporary diarrhea be considered an adverse health effect in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adults or infants? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(15) Would exemptions provide a mechanism for relief to smaller systems? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(16) Should compliance be limited to central treatment? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(17) Is it appropriate under SDWA to allow the use of bottled water and POU 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices for sulfate MCL compliance? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(18) What degree of flexibility is appropriate in the bottled water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring requirements and delivery mechanism? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(19) In Options 1 and 4, should all the existing regulations regarding use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of POU and POE devices be imposed in the case of sulfate levels higher than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the MCL, or are more flexible requirements appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(20) Should the generic public notice requirements applicable to variances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under &sect;141.32 apply under Option 4 to systems who choose central treatment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in lieu of the public notice requirements proposed in Option 1? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(21) Are the assumptions used in the analysis of the costs and benefits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed rule reasonable? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(22) What flexibility is appropriate or practical in regard to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance of POU/POE devices installed to comply with the sulfate MCL? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
What flexibility is appropriate regarding a reduction in monitoring if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain types of POU/POE devices were installed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(23) Would most States offer the alternative option to PWS as a means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) calls for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency to consider the potential impacts of proposed regulations on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small businesses, organizations and government jurisdictions. If an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis shows that regulations would have a significant impact on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial number (usually taken as at least 20 percent) of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities, then a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA) must be prepared. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In an RFA, an agency examines ``any significant alternatives to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule which accomplish the stated objectives of applicable statutes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which minimize any significant economic impact of the proposed rule on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities'' (Regulatory Flexibility Act section 603). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposed regulation would affect less than 2,000, or one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percent, of the total of 200,000 public water systems (including all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
community and non-community systems). Nevertheless, EPA's analysis shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that regulating sulfate through standard approaches that assume the need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for central treatment would have significant economic impacts that would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fall largely on smaller public water systems. Therefore, EPA has conducted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a regulatory flexibility analysis by investigating alternative, less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burdensome regulatory approaches for those small systems. From these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
investigations, EPA developed and is considering the innovative options for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulating sulfate described earlier in this notice. These innovative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
options accomplish the Regulatory Flexibility Act's goal of minimizing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of this regulation on small public water systems while meeting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objectives of the Safe Drinking Water Act by ensuring that drinking water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that meets the sulfate MCL will be provided to all persons within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
target population.

B. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). An Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Collection Request (ICR) document has been prepared by EPA(ICR No. 270.34) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a copy may be obtained from Sandy Farmer, Information Policy Branch; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA; 401 M Street, SW. (Mail Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460 or by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calling (202) 260&hyph;2740. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This collection of information has an estimated annual reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recordkeeping burden averaging 9.3 hours per respondent. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates include time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewing the collection of information. National annual burden and cost 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimates for PWSs and States are presented in Table 11. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burden to Chief, Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M Street, SW. (Mail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Code 2136); Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Information and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget; Washington, DC 20503, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA''. The final rule will respond to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contained in this proposal.

C. Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12875, Enhancing Intergovernmental Partnerships 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explicitly requires Federal agencies to consult with State, local, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tribal entities in the development of rules and policies that will affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them. EPA has complied with the Order in proposing the sulfate rule in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following ways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, the Agency met with interested parties, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives from four States, Region 8, and the Association of State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drinking Water Administrators in Denver, Colorado in November, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secondly, the Agency plans to meet with the National Drinking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water Advisory Council (NDWAC), a group composed of representatives from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State, local and tribal governments in addition to water suppliers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmentalists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thirdly, the Agency is developing generic contacts with State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tribal and local fiscal and program officials which will enable various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs to consult with affected parties in a coordinated fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Identification of appropriate contacts was not accomplished in a time frame 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which enabled EPA's Office of Water to have extensive consultation with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected parties in compliance with the E.O. before proposal. However, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contact person has now been designated from ASDWA, and the Agency will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meeting with this designee and other interested State officials. EPA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to expanded dialogue and collaboration with State, Tribal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
local governments. EPA will schedule a work group or public meeting to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicit comments of fiscal and program officials or State, Tribal and local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governments. The intent of such a meeting is to allow for the maximum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
input from the regulated community for the drafting of the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will also send copies of this proposed rule to these governmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bodies, as well as to national and local associations (e.g., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of State Drinking Water Administrators, the National League of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cities, the National Association of Towns and Townships, the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of County Health Officers, etc.)

Compliance with the MCL for Sulfate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (i) PWSs subject to the sulfate MCL established under &sect;141.62(b) shall demonstrate compliance with the sulfate
MCL. If authorized by the State to do so, PWSs may choose to comply in one of the following two ways: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) The PWS shall demonstrate compliance by achieving the MCL in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples taken at each entry point to the distribution system; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) The PWS shall demonstrate compliance by meeting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;&sect;141.23(r)(2) and (3) (program for providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative Water to Target Populations and providing public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification and education). The requirements of &sect;&sect;141.23(r)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (3), taken together, are termed the ``Alternative Method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance.'' However, the availability of the Alternative Method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Compliance is limited by paragraph (r)(1)(ii) of this section.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(ii) The State has the option of whether or not to allow PWSs to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate compliance through the Alternative Method of Compliance. Where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the State has chosen not to allow the Alternative Method of Compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PWSs shall demonstrate compliance by achieving the MCL in samples taken at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each entry point to the distribution system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Where EPA is the primacy agent, the Regional Administrator may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorize PWSs to demonstrate compliance through the Alternative Method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance. In determining whether to authorize the use of the Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method of Compliance, the Regional Administration in its sole discretion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may consider the availability of regional resources, and whether it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable and practical for the Regional Office to oversee implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Alternative Method of Compliance. If the Regional Administrator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorizes the Alternative Method of Compliance, each PWS shall have the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option to comply either by achieving the MCL in samples taken at each entry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
point to the distribution system or through the Alternative Method of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) Until such time as notified by the State or Primacy Agency that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative Method of Compliance will be authorized, PWSs shall be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to achieve the MCL at each entry point to the distribution system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) The general prohibition on the use of bottled water and point-of-use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices in 40 CFR 141.101 shall not apply to PWSs that choose to achieve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with the MCL for sulfate by meeting the requirements of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative Method of Compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) A PWS must report failure to comply with a NPDWR to the State under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements of 40 CFR 141.31. Within 30 days of notifying the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of failure to comply with the sulfate MCL, the PWS shall notify the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as to which of the two methods of compliance, &sect;141.23(r)(1)(i) (A) or (B), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the PWS intends to use to return to compliance with the sulfate MCL.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Public Notification/Education Program. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The requirements of this section apply only in States which have authorized the Alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Method of Compliance. The requirements apply only to those PWSs in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States which have chosen to comply with the sulfate MCL through the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternative Method of Compliance rather than by achieving the MCL in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
samples taken at each entry point to the distribution system. The PWS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall implement the public notification/education program described in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsection in lieu of &sect;141.32, and shall provide the State with copies of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all public notification and education materials at the same time. There 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are four components to the program: Notices in bills, pamphlets, signs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and notices to the media. Transient systems (e.g., campgrounds and gas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stations) and non-transient, non-community systems (e.g. schools, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factories) shall be required to post signs in accordance with paragraphs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(r)(3)(v) of this section, but shall not be required to comply with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for notices in bills, notices to the media, or pamphlets in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs (r)(3) (i)&hyph;(iv) and (vi) of this section. Community water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems which are non-transient systems shall comply with all four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components set forth in paragraphs (r)(3) (i)&hyph;(vi) of this section, i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notices in bills, pamphlets, signs, and notices to the media.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Newspaper, mail, hand delivery, of notices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
PWSs shall give notice by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the area served 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the system as soon as possible, but in no case later than 14 days after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate in excess of the MCL has been detected in the water. The notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall be repeated at intervals of 6 months while the sulfate concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the water in the distribution system continues to exceed the MCL. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the area served by a public water system is not served by a daily newspaper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of general circulation, notice shall instead be given by publication in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
weekly newspaper of general circulation. The notice shall define and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
describe the geographic location served by the system. In communities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where a significant portion of the population speaks a language other than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
English, the text shall be published in the appropriate language(s), in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to English. A telephone number(s) and an office location for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting Alternative Water delivery shall be provided. The notice shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be provided at least once every six months by mail delivery (by direct mail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or with the water bill), or by hand delivery, not later than 45 days after

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information presented shall be consistent with the information in these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraphs, and in plain English that can be understood by laypersons. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communities where a significant portion of the population speaks a language 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other than English, the text shall be published in the appropriate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language(s), in addition to English. The text shall be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Introduction. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the [insert name of State primacy agency], and [insert name of water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supplier] are concerned about sulfate in your drinking water. Sulfate salts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are found naturally in soil and rock in certain areas of the country, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including ours. With the exception of infants, residents of the area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be accustomed to the sulfate in our drinking water, and should not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience ill effects. However, people who are not accustomed to high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of sulfate in their drinking water may experience diarrhea. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal law, we are required to provide sensitive populations with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative water until their bodies adapt to the sulfate concentrations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our water. This brochure explains the simple steps you can take to protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the sensitive populations: infants, visitors from outside the area, and new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residents.

Health Effects of Sulfate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ingestion of sulfate in high concentrations is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known to cause diarrhea. The greatest risk is to infants, for whom 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prolonged diarrhea can be dangerous. New residents and travelers may also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience diarrhea when they first drink water with high levels of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sulfate. After approximately two weeks, adult's bodies become accustomed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the sulfate, and the diarrhea stops. Available studies have not shown 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any long-term or chronic adverse effects from consuming sulfate in drinking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water. Boiling the water will not reduce the sulfate content, and in fact, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will concentrate it through evaporation of the water.

The Alternative Water Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If you are expecting a baby, if you are a new resident, or expecting visitors from outside the area, please call [insert
phone number of water system] to request delivery of alternative water to your home. We will provide you with sufficient
water for the cooking and drinking needs for each sensitive person. We will provide you with two liters per day of bottled
water for your infant for up to 20 weeks, during which time you should gradually add tap water to the bottled water. In
this way, your baby will become gradually accustomed to the sulfate in the water. We will provide your out-of-town
guests with two liters of bottled water per day for the period needed, up to a maximum of six weeks. We will provide new
residents with two liters per person per day for up to six weeks. During that time, tap water should be gradually mixed
with the bottled water. Restaurants and other establishments who are likely to serve at least some members of the target
population on a continual basis may be provided individual treatment devices, depending on our evaluation of the
size of the target population and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumstances.

The PWS shall provide notice of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following to new customers or billing units prior to or on the date service begins: Sulfate MCL exceedence in the water
entering the distribution system, the health effect of sulfate for target populations, and the need to mix bottled
water and tap water for gradual acclimation to sulfate.

of water which could be used for drinking water in places such as restaurants, hotels/motels, rest areas, campgrounds,
gas stations and public areas where not all taps will have treated water. If such facilities are equipped with a POE
device or with POU devices such that all taps deliver water in compliance with the sulfate MCL, sign posting is not required.
The signs must state the location of the nearest source of water which complies with the sulfate MCL and why precautions
should be taken by non-acclimated persons. The text of the sign, in multiple languages where appropriate, shall be

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed revision to the nonprocurement common rule is issued in response to Executive Order 12689 and section
2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994. E.O. 12689 requires agencies to establish regulations
for reciprocal governmentwide effect across procurement and nonprocurement for each agency's debarment and suspension
actions, after technical differences between the procurement and nonprocurement regulations governing debarments
and suspensions are resolved. Section 2455 provides that the debarment, suspension, or other exclusion of a participant
in a procurement activity under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or in a nonprocurement activity under regulations
issued pursuant to Executive Order 12549, shall be given reciprocal governmentwide effect.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the Federal Government's initiatives to curb fraud, waste, and abuse, on February 18, 1986, President Reagan
signed Executive Order (E.O.) 12549, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' E.O. 12549 established governmentwide effect
for an agency's nonprocurement debarment and suspension actions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6 of E.O. 12549 directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue guidelines governing implementation
of the Order, and section 3 of the Order directed the departments and agencies to promulgate final rules, consistent
with these guidelines. On May 26, 1988, 27 agencies issued a final common rule (53 FR 19161&hyph;19211), consistent
with OMB guidelines. On January 30, 1989, six more agencies co-signed the final common rule (54 FR 4722&hyph;4735).
On November 27, 1992 and May 17, 1993, two more agencies co-signed the final common rule (57 FR 56262 and 58 FR 28759).
On April 4, 1994, the functions of ACTION were transferred to the Corporation for National and Community Service.
Each agency's codification of the common rule appears in its volume of the Code of Federal Regulations. The Federal
Home Loan Bank Board, which participated in the initial rulemaking, no longer exists. On June 30, 1992, the Commission
on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution closed and thus will not participate in this proposed rulemaking.
Section 4 of E.O. 12549 established the Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension (the Interagency Committee).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 On August 16, 1989, President Bush signed E.O. 12689, ``Debarment and Suspension.'' E.O. 12689 requires agencies
to establish regulations providing for reciprocal governmentwide effect across procurement and nonprocurement
for each agency's debarment and suspension actions, after technical differences between the procurement and nonprocurement
regulations governing debarments and suspensions are resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 President Clinton signed Public Law 103&hyph;355, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 on October 13,
1994. Section 2455 of that Act provides that the debarment, suspension, or other exclusion of a participant in a procurement
activity under the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or in a nonprocurement activity under regulations issued pursuant
to E.O. 12549, shall be given reciprocal governmentwide effect. Thus, these proposed regulations would implement
both E.O. 12689 and section 2455 of Pub. L. 103&hyph;355.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Interagency Committee established three subcommittees that identified issues and made recommendations for
consideration by the full Interagency Committee. The matters addressed by the three subcommittees were technical
differences between the procurement and nonprocurement rules, automation issues, and nonprocurement scope. In
1989, the Interagency Committee presented recommendations to the agencies participating in this rulemaking action.
The agencies considered these proposed changes and concluded that the initial recommendations addressed more issues
than necessary to implement the Executive Order. As a result, representatives of the participating agencies reconsidered
their initial recommendations and determined that very few technical differences needed to be resolved to obtain
reciprocity between the procurement and nonprocurement rules. The determinations of the agency representatives
are incorporated in this notice of proposed rulemaking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Section 3 of E.O. 12689 directed the agencies to simultaneously publish proposed rules within six months after resolution
of differences between the procurement and nonprocurement rules and to publish final regulations within 12 months
after publication of the proposed rules. The Federal Acquisition Regulation provisions governing debarments and
suspensions are also being published for comment today.

In order to focus commenters' attention on the changes that are proposed for the nonprocurement debarment and suspension
rule, the agencies participating in this proposed rulemaking_all but the Department of Transportation which did
not complete clearance of this proposed rule_have decided to publish the text of only those portions of the common
rule that are affected by changes proposed by the Interagency Committee, rather than publishing the complete text
of the common rule. Comments are sought on only those portions of the common rule that are proposed for amendment in
this document.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the amendments discussed below, the agencies propose to make minor technical changes to correct spelling
errors and other nonsubstantive errors in the printing of the common rule.

.110(c) would be amended to provide for reciprocity between nonprocurement and procurement debarment and suspension
actions. Under the reciprocity rule, every Executive Branch agency would have to give effect not only to exclusionary
actions of other Federal agencies under the common rule but also to debarments, suspensions, proposed debarments
or other governmentwide exclusions imposed under the Federal Acquisition Regulation after the effective date of
the common rule reciprocity amendments. Thus, for example, once an agency has proposed for debarment an entity under
the FAR, no other executive agency could enter into a covered transaction with that entity nor could a primary tier
recipient enter into a lower tier covered transaction with that entity.

the FAR.

 As stated in the supplementary information to the common rule, the purpose of this proposed rule is to give reciprocal
governmentwide effect to both nonprocurement and procurement debarment and suspension actions. SBA reads proposed
section 145.110(c) as having no effect on the exceptions from coverage already provided for in sections 145.110(a)(2),
145.215, and 145.220. These exemptions include SBA disaster assistance.

ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with Executive Order 12549, the Department, along with other Federal agencies, promulgated governmentwide
non-procurement debarment and suspension regulations. The common rule, which is identical to the Office of Management
and Budget's final guidelines, and the various agency-specific supplements to the common rule were published at
the same time on May 26, 1988 (53 FR 19161). The provisions of the common rule that provide nonprocurement participants
with the opportunity to contest suspensions and proposed debarments and the procedures by which suspending and debarring
officials make final agency determinations are substantially similar to the procedures applicable to procurement
contractors under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR, 48 CFR, especially subpart 9.4 thereof). Although the
Department adopted verbatim significant portions of the common rule, it did not include the provisions concerning
suspension and debarment hearing procedures or the reconsideration or appeal of post-hearing determinations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1989, Executive Order 12689 required that the debarment, suspension, or other exclusion of a participant in a procurement
activity under the FAR, or in a nonprocurement activity under an agency's debarment regulations, shall have the governmentwide
effect of excluding the participant from both procurement and nonprocurement activities. Under current HUD rules,
a debarment of a nonprocurement participant does not affect such person's participation in procurement activities
with other agencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the proposed revisions would conform the Department's hearing procedures to those of the common rule.
The Department's departure from the generally applicable governmentwide provisions has adversely affected the
Department's ability to process suspensions and debarments in an efficient and cost-effective manner. The amount
of time and expense currently involved in the Department's suspension and debarment proceedings benefit neither
the Department nor the persons who are subject to such sanctions. The Department considers these changes necessary
to comply with the President's directive to streamline agency operations throughout the Executive Branch. The proposed
revisions are also an element in the Government reinvention process at the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments from the public will be considered prior to issuance of a final rule. No hearing will be conducted
with respect to this proposed rule.

Within 30 days after receiving a notice of limited denial of participation, the respondent may request a conference

the notice of limited denial of participation shall become final. The conference shall precede any submission in
opposition under &sect;24.713 of this part. It shall be held within 15 days after the Department's receipt of the request
for a conference, unless the respondent waives this time limit. The official who imposed the sanction, or his or her
designee, shall preside. At the conference, the respondent may appear with a representative and may present all relevant
information and materials to the official or designee. Within 20 days after the conference, the official shall, in
writing, advise the respondent of the decision to terminate, modify, or affirm the limited denial of participation.
If the official's decision is to affirm all or a portion of the remaining period of exclusion, the notice of affirmation

If a respondent has contested a notice of affirmation pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, and if the respondent
has also received, pursuant to subpart C or D of this part, a notice of proposed debarment or suspension that is based
on the same transaction(s) or conduct as the limited denial of participation, the following rules shall apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the respondent has not contested the proposed debarment pursuant to &sect;24.313(a) or the suspension pursuant
to &sect;24.412(a), the final imposition of the debarment or suspension shall also constitute a final decision with
respect to the limited denial of participation to the extent that the debarment or suspension is based on the same transaction(s)
or conduct as the limited denial of participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the respondent has contested the proposed debarment pursuant to &sect;24.313(a) of this part or the suspension
pursuant to &sect;24.412(a), the hearing official shall consolidate the hearings on the limited denial of participation
and on the proposed debarment or suspension. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) To the extent that the limited denial of participation is based on additional transaction(s) or conduct that are
not described in the notice of proposed debarment or suspension, the hearing official shall, in his or her discretion,
either withdraw the limited denial of participation to the extent of such additional bases, or issue a decision on
them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Reporting of limited denial of participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the period for requesting a conference pursuant to &sect;24.712 of this part has expired without receipt of such
a request, or if a conference has been held and a notice of affirmation of all or part of the remaining period of exclusion
has been issued pursuant to &sect;24.712, the official imposing the limited denial of participation shall notify
the Director of the Participation and Compliance Division in the Office of Housing of the scope of the limited denial
of participation.

The Department of Defense proposes to adopt this amendment to the Governmentwide common rule on debarment and suspension
for nonprocurement transactions. In adopting this rule, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Military Departments
and the Defense Agencies will maintain uniform policies and procedures that are consistent with those of other Executive
Departments and Agencies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Defense originally codified this Governmentwide rule on May 26, 1988 (53 FR 19190 and 19204), at
32 CFR Part 280. On February 21, 1992 (57 FR 6199), Part 280 was redesignated as Part 25. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
proposes to amend the redesignated Part 25.

ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In addition to the amendments proposed by all participating agencies for the common rule, the Secretary proposes
to amend the Department's debarment and suspension procedures to reflect certain changes made by 1992 amendments
to those provisions of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (title IV, HEA), that govern administrative
proceedings to limit or terminate the eligibility of participants in programs under that title. The Secretary also
proposes to amend subpart G of part 668, which contains the Department's procedures for fine, limitation, suspension,
and termination proceedings, to make technical amendments to reflect the 1992 amendments to the HEA, to amend Subpart
G of Part 682 in order to apply the same procedures to debarments or suspensions of lenders or loan servicers under the
Federal Family Education Loan Programs (FFELP), and to limit a hearing officer's discretion in termination and suspension
actions under both subparts when the termination or suspension is based on an action under Executive Order 12549 (3
CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189) or the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), 48 CFR part 9, subpart 9.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In 1988, when the governmentwide nonprocurement debarment and suspension regulations were first published, the
Department established procedures to ensure that debarment actions would trigger actions by the Department under
part 668 to consider termination of institutions participating in Title IV, HEA. Those special rules were needed
because section 487(c) of the HEA, 20 U.S.C. 1094(c), provided that actions to limit, suspend or terminate the eligibility
of a school in the Title IV, HEA programs be conducted with an opportunity for a hearing ``on the record'' under 5 U.S.C.
554&hyph;557 while debarment and suspension actions did not have to comply with these ``on-the-record'' hearing
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1992 Congress amended the HEA to eliminate the need for these procedures to include an opportunity for a hearing
``on-the-record.'' However, Title IV, HEA suspension or termination procedures include notice and procedural
requirements that are different than those required under the debarment and suspension common rule. Therefore,
the Secretary proposes to give direct effect with respect to eligibility to participate in a Title IV, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HEA program only to those debarment and suspension actions that have been imposed under procedures that provide equivalent
due process protections to those afforded under the procedural standards in Subparts G of Parts 668 and 682. The Secretary
recognizes that the procedures applied by the Department or by another agency may differ in some particulars from
Subpart G procedures, but provide the same level of procedural due process, and where the Secretary so determines,
that debarment or suspension will apply with respect to participation in Title IV, HEA programs without further administrative
appeal. Also, the Secretary proposes to amend those Subparts to provide that a hearing officer must terminate or limit
an entity if the designated Department official proves that the entity has been debarred. The addition of this as a
mandatory ground for termination reflects the Secretary's recognition of the compelling government interest underlying
debarment and suspension decisions in ensuring protection of public funds and deterring their misuse; the adoption
of a binding rule that debarment or suspension warrants termination or suspension is consistent with similar determinations
compelled under the regulations in cases in which there has been a failure to submit timely required audits, or loss
of required accreditation or State licensure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding suspensions, the Secretary has concluded that there are significant legal differences between suspensions
under part 85 and emergency actions under parts 668 and 682.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, suspensions under part 85 or the common regulations of other agencies will not be given effect as emergency
actions under those parts. However, the Secretary proposes to amend part 85 to provide that, whenever an institution,
lender, or third-party servicer is suspended under the common rule, the Secretary will determine whether an emergency
action should be initiated against that entity.

ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department published an agency-specific preamble as part of the final nonprocurement debarment and suspension
common rule on May 26, 1988 (53 FR 19159), which indicated that, due to the expanded scope of transactions covered under
the rule, coverage of its nonprocurement debarment and suspension system was limited to transactions included in
section 12.110(a)(1) of its proposed rule (52 FR 39042). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department also indicated that a review of the Department's other nonprocurement program activities would be
made to determine whether such activities would be included in the coverage. The review was made; however, plans to
issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to obtain public comment on covered transactions on or before October 1, 1988,
were dropped. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issues of concern to the Department were addressed through the subcommittee of the Interagency Committee on Debarment
and Suspension which reviewed the scope of the nonprocurement debarment system. Although the revision of the common
rule being proposed does not address the issue of scope, the Department is proposing to include the results of the resolution
of this issue as part of the publication of this proposed revision as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New exceptions for certain types of transactions under natural resource management programs are being proposed.
These exceptions would make clear that permits, licenses, exchanges and other acquisitions of real property, rights-of-way,
and easements, under natural resource management programs would be excluded from coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, when the Federal Government seeks to acquire real property, including through use of an exchange of real
property elsewhere, the transaction will not be subject to these regulations. In such cases, where the success of
the agency program depends on a specific parcel of land, the application of the debarment and suspension system could
harm the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, public land management activities require the use of certain transactions for land and resource management
without regard to the identity of the recipient. Accordingly, range management transactions, such as grazing permits
and rights-of-way, are excluded by the proposed exception language. Similarly, virtually all recreation management
and public land access transactions are not covered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Department is proposing to amend section 12.110(a)(3) of its final rule to include nonprocurement
debarment system coverage for Federal acquisition of a leasehold interest or any other interest in real property,
concession contracts, and disposition of Federal real and personal property and natural resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scope of the Department's nonprocurement debarment system will include transactions associated with natural
resources management programs and the disposition of natural resources with the following exceptions: permits,
licenses, exchanges and other acquisitions of real property, rights-of-way, easements, mineral patent claims
administered by the Bureau of Land Management and water service contracts and repayment contracts awarded by the
Bureau of Reclamation. Patents issued under the Mining Law of 1872, 30 U.S.C. 22 et seq., as amended are statutory entitlements
and, therefore, are exempt under the terms of Executive Order 12549. The award of water service contracts and repayment
contracts is mandatory, provided by the Reclamation Project Act of 1939, as amended, set forth at 43 U.S.C. 485. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Department proposes to exclude all transactions concerning permits, licenses, exchanges and other
acquisitions of real property, rights-of-way, easements, mineral patent claims, water service contracts, and
repayment contracts from its nonprocurement debarment and suspension system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A corresponding change is also being proposed in Section 12.200(c) to add a reference to these excluded transactions.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule is issued pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;355
(the Act). The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council is considering amending Federal Acquisition Regulation
(FAR) Subpart 9.4, Debarment, Suspension, and Ineligibility, the clause at 52.209&hyph;6, Protecting the Government's
Interest when Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended or Proposed for Debarment, and provisions in
parts 22, 28, and 44, respectively. This includes information required to support the policy of ensuring that suspensions,
debarments, and other exclusions from procurement and nonprocurement activities receive reciprocal Government-wide
effect as directed by Executive Order (E.O.) 12689, dated August 16, 1989, and Section 2455, Uniform Suspension and
Debarment, of the Act. This regulatory action was subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive
Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;355 (the Act), provides authorities that streamline
the acquisition process and minimize burdensome government-unique requirements. Major changes that can be expected
in the acquisition process as a result of the Act's implementation include changes in the areas of Commercial Item
Acquisition, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Truth in Negotiations Act, and introduction of the Federal
Acquisition Computer Network. In order to promptly achieve the benefits of the provisions of the Act, the Government
is issuing implementing regulations on an expedited basis. We believe prompt publication of proposed rules provides
the public the opportunity to participate more fully in the process of developing regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAR case 94&hyph;801 originated because Section 2455 of Public Law 103&hyph;355 was enacted to remedy the current
situation where suspensions, debarments and other exclusions from procurement and nonprocurement activities
do not have reciprocal Government-wide effect. The concept of reciprocity for procurement and nonprocurement suspension
and debarment actions is not new. Since August 1989 there has been an effort to do by executive order (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, E.O. 12689), what section 2455 now prescribes by law. That earlier effort was worked on by a committee known as the
``Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension.'' This Interagency Committee is made up of 16 Federal executive
agencies that impose nonprocurement suspensions and debarments. By October 1994 the agencies in an ad hoc group reached
agreement on the language that would implement the concept of reciprocity and be consistent with the principles of
the National Performance Review. The language proposed for FAR 9.401, Applicability, has been coordinated with
the ad hoc group of agencies. The proposed changes to the procurement and nonprocurement rules will implement Section
2455 and E.O. 12689 by ensuring that suspensions, debarments, and other exclusions from procurement and nonprocurement
activities have reciprocal Government-wide effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAR Council is interested in an exchange of ideas and opinions with respect to the regulatory implementation of
the Act. For that reason, the FAR Council is conducting a series of public meetings. However, the FAR Council has not
scheduled a public meeting on this rule (FAR case 94&hyph;801) because of the clarity and non-controversial nature
of the rule. If the public believes such a meeting is needed with respect to this rule, a letter requesting a public meeting
and outlining the nature of the requested meeting shall be submitted to and received by the FAR Secretariat (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
caption) on or before January 19, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAR Council will consider such requests in determining whether a public meeting on this rule should be scheduled.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within
the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Only a very small percentage of Federal contractors are debarred or suspended. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties.
Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with Section
610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite FAR case 94&hyph;801 in correspondence.

C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

 The Commission is proposing today amendments relating to the safe harbor provisions of Rules 138 and 139 under the
Securities Act of 1933. The proposed amendments are intended to clarify the availability of the safe harbor provisions

A. Rule 139 Safe Harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 139 under the Securities Act provides safe harbor protection from the registration requirements of that Act
for the distribution by broker-dealers of information, opinions or recommendations concerning issuers in the process
of registering securities under the Securities Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to April 1994, reliance on the safe harbor for research reports concerning a foreign private issuer were conditioned
on eligibility of the foreign private issuer for use of Form F&hyph;3.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 On April 19, 1994, the Commission adopted amendments to Rule 139 that make the rule available for offerings by foreign
private issuers that would be eligible to use Form F&hyph;3 but for the 12-month reporting requirement if the issuer
meets an alternative offshore trading history test.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the alternative test, a foreign private issuer must have been listed or quoted on a designated offshore securities
market
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

In adopting these amendments, the Commission intended that broker-dealers would be able to rely upon Rule 139 for
sizable foreign private issuers with respect to which there is a stream of corporate information available in the
marketplace, including qualifying foreign issuers registering securities with the Commission for the first time.
As drafted, however, the amendments did not make clear that the elimination of the reporting history requirement
included the elimination of the requirement that a foreign issuer be previously reporting pursuant to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'')

The amendments proposed today revise Rule 139 to make clear that the special provisions adopted last year for sizable
foreign issuers are also available for those issuers' initial public offerings in the United States.

In order to make the rule available to first-time sizable foreign registrants, the Commission is proposing to amend
the first sentence of the rule to provide that a foreign private issuer that meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)
of the Rule need not previously have been reporting pursuant to the Exchange Act. In addition, language would be added
to paragraph (a)(2) to provide that such foreign private issuer need not have filed an annual report as a condition
of eligibility for the rule.

B. Rule 138 Safe Harbor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rule 138 under the Securities Act permits publication of information, opinions and recommendations concerning
qualifying issuers by broker-dealers that are participants in a distribution, so long as the reports contain information,
opinions or recommendations regarding a specified class of the issuer's securities which is not the subject of the
offering in which the broker-dealer is a participant. The rule defines eligible issuers as those that may register
securities on Forms S&hyph;2
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or F&hyph;2.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The reference to Forms S&hyph;2 and F&hyph;2 is intended to include issuers eligible to register on Forms S&hyph;3
and F&hyph;3 as well. Questions have arisen as to the availability of the Rule 138 safe harbor for offerings registered
on Form S&hyph;3 where issuers have not been subject to reporting requirements for 36 months. The Commission did not
intend to change the availability of Rule 138 for those offerings when it reduced the reporting history requirements
for Form S&hyph;3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
11
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and is of the view that Rule 138 is still available for offerings registered on Form S&hyph;3. Rule 138 is proposed to
be amended to clarify this point. The Commission is also proposing to amend the rule to clarify that Form F&hyph;3 eligible
issuers would qualify for the rule, as would qualifying first-time foreign issuers that meet the alternative offshore
trading history test proposed for Rule 139.

In Release No. 33&hyph;6550 (Sept. 19, 1984) 49 FR 37569 at footnote 26, the Commission stated that ``[b]ecause the
markets for nonconvertible senior securities and common stock differ, Rule 138 provides a somewhat broader safe
harbor [than Rule 139] in circumstances where the opportunity to condition the market is lessened.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, in light of the fact that shelf registration statements often register both debt and equity securities
(on an either allocated or unallocated basis), the Commission is proposing to add an instruction to Rule 138 to codify
the staff interpretation that the rule should be applied on an offering-by-offering basis for issuers which are eligible
to use Forms S&hyph;3 or F&hyph;3 and are using the Commission's shelf registration procedures.

Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Chairman of the Commission has certified that the
proposed amendments to Securities Act Rules 138 and 139 relating to broker-dealer research reports (17 CFR 230.138
and 17 CFR 230.139) will not, if adopted, have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. This
certification, including the reasons therefor, is attached as Appendix A to this release.

I, Arthur Levitt, Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission''), hereby
certify pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that proposed revisions to Rules 138 and 139 under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
``Securities Act''), if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. The reason for this certification is that the proposed revisions to the rules are intended to clarify the
availability of the safe harbor provisions of the rules with respect to large domestic and foreign issuers. Any incidental
impact on small U.S. entities is not expected to be significant.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule would make changes in the Department's regulations governing sanctions imposed by the Mortgagee
Review Board. The proposed rule would also make conforming changes to the regulations concerning HUD's hearing officers,
consistent with the revisions proposed herein and in the proposed revision to 24 CFR part 24 published elsewhere in
today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. The changes to the Mortgagee Review Board actions are intended to follow more closely the statutory provisions set
forth at 12 U.S.C. 1708(c). The Department considers these proposed revisions necessary to comply with the President's
directive to streamline agency operations throughout the Executive Branch. The proposed revisions are also an element
in the Government reinvention process at the Department.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 202 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1708 (c) and (d)) established the Mortgagee Review Board (``Board'').
Section 202(c)(4) directs the Board to ``hold a hearing on the record'' concerning sanctions it has taken against
a mortgagee, if the mortgagee so requests within 30 days notice of the Board's action. However, HUD's current regulations
delegate the Board's authority to hold hearings to hearing officers (administrative law judges and Board of Contract
Appeals judges). These proceedings have proven extremely time-consuming and expensive. Accordingly, this proposed
rule will return the hearing function to the Board, thereby streamlining the hearing process.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule also implements the 1992 amendments to Section 202. These amendments limited a suspension issued
by the Board to not more than one year, unless extended for not more than six additional months, to protect the public
interest, or unless extended with the mortgagee's agreement. The amendments also clarified that the term ``mortgagee''
included lenders or loan correspondents approved under the National Housing Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule also would make conforming changes to HUD's regulations governing hearing officers, consistent
with the proposed revisions both to the Board's regulations and to 24 CFR part 24, published elsewhere in today's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments from the public will be considered prior to issuance of a final rule. No hearing will be conducted
with respect to this proposed rule.

Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment required by the National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4331) is unnecessary since the rule addresses administrative decisions whose content does
not constitute a development decision nor affect the physical condition of a project area or building.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the Secretary by his approval of this rule certifies that
this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule would implement
statutory authority that is intended to protect the Department's programs from abusive practices, but it should
have no adverse or disproportionate economic impact on small businesses.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule was reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget as a significant rule, as this term is defined
in Executive Order 12866, which was signed by the President on September 30, 1993. Any changes to the rule as a result
of that review are contained in the public file for the rule in the Department's Office of the Rules Docket Clerk.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this
rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and,
thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule alters the administrative procedures associated with the
prosecution of abuses of HUD programs, but it has no impact on family-related concerns.

The General Counsel, as the designated Official under Section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions,
or the relationship between the Federal government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities
between them and other levels of government. The rule's major effects are on individuals and businesses.

 (59 FR 33950), GIPSA announced that the designation of Minnesota would expire on December 31, 1994, and asked persons
interested in providing official services in the geographic area assigned to Minnesota to submit an application
for designation. Applications were due by August 1, 1994. There were five applicants for the Minnesota area: Minnesota
applied for the entire area currently assigned to them; Southern Minnesota Grain Inspection, Inc., applied for all
or part of the Minnesota area; Mid-Iowa Grain Inspection, Inc., applied for the Minnesota counties of Fillmore, Houston,
Olmsted, Winona, Wabasha, Goodhue, and Dakota, or any area inclusive of the city of Winona; D. R. Schaal Agency applied
for all or any part of the Minnesota counties of Faribault, Freeborn, and Mower; and Sioux City Inspection and Weighing
Service Company applied for the Minnesota counties of Murray, Nobles, Pipestone, and Rock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 45295). Comments were due by September 30, 1994. GIPSA received 51 comments by the deadline. One comment was
about two of the applicants. There were no comments on Mid-Iowa. There were 14 comments on Minnesota. Two grain firms
currently served by Minnesota and one official grain inspection agency supported Minnesota. There also were 11 comments
from various State government officials and groups representing State employees, all supporting Minnesota's redesignation.
There were 3 comments on Schaal. Three grain firms, in the area Schaal applied for and currently served by Minnesota,
submitted comments supporting Schaal. There were no comments on Sioux City. There were 29 comments on Southern Minnesota.
Twenty-three grain firms in the area currently served by Minnesota and 6 non-grain businesses supported Southern
Minnesota. Four trade organizations and 2 grain firms also submitted comments with no specific recommendations.
These groups urge FGIS to carefully consider all options, with a special view towards the quality and cost of service,
and ability to provide service in the State of Minnesota.

The Census Bureau conducts the Survey of Building or Zoning Permits Issued and Local Public Construction to gather
information from state and local building permit officials on the number and value of new building permits issued.
The Census Bureau uses this information to produce monthly estimates and annual totals of residential and nonresidential
construction and demolitions authorized by building permits. This survey provides policymakers, planners, businesspersons,
and others with detailed geographic data for formulating economic policy, controlling growth and planning for local
services, and developing production and marketing plans. This survey also provides widely used measures of construction
activity, including the key economic indicator, Housing Units Authorized by Building Permits.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On June 29, 1994, the Department of Education published a notice of a new system of records for the National Student
Loan Data System (NSLDS). The Department solicited comments on the routine uses for the system and submitted a report
of the system to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Congress. The Department received comments from one
commenter and some suggestions from OMB regarding improvements to the notice. Several changes have been made to the
system as a result of this input and are discussed in the supplementary information portion of this notice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on June 29, 1994 (59 FR 33491) a notice of a new system of records for the National Student Loan Data System (18&hyph;40&hyph;0039).
The Department received comments from one commenter and some suggestions for improvement to the system notice from
OMB. As a result, several changes have been made to the system notice. Those changes are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regarding the categories of individuals clause, it was noted that the phrase ``borrowers who have applied for loans
under the FFEL (Federal Family Education Loan) Program will be tracked on this new system&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.''
implies that the system will maintain data on all students who have applied for aid under Title IV of the Higher Education
Act of 1965 (Title IV, HEA) not just those who have received aid. The Department did not intend to cover under this system
applicants who may apply for but do not receive aid and this clause has been modified to refer to individuals who applied
for and received certain Title IV loans. In addition, because the system notice only covers individuals, references
to persons who have died are removed, because persons who have died are not considered individuals under the Privacy
Act. However, as a practical matter, the Department will maintain information about these persons as necessary to
manage the Title IV program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the categories of records clause, the entry ``an applicant's demographic background'' has been removed
because it was only descriptive of the categories of information that followed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the routine uses for the system, the following paragraphs discuss the changes the Department is making
to the system and issues raised by the comments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Routine use (a): Program purposes. Paragraph (2) has been removed and the entities for which each disclosure is appropriate
have been included with the program purpose disclosures. A number of program purpose routine uses were dropped from
the notice because the Department does not disclose individually identifiable information in connection with certain
purposes that were included in the original Privacy Act notice. The program purposes have been broken out into a series
of eight (8) separate routine uses. Also, the program purpose routine uses are recast to focus on the purpose of each
disclosure rather than the end results of the disclosure. Disclosure to OMB under the Credit Reform Act (CRA) is removed
from the program purpose routine uses and stated as a separate routine use. The General Accounting Office (GAO) is
removed as a recipient under the program purpose routine uses because it can get records under 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(10)
in the course of performing its duties. Finally, consistent with the preamble of the initial notice of this system
and as stated in the purposes of the system, disclosures from this system of records may be made to enforce the terms
of a loan and to collect a loan. This purpose for disclosure is clarified now in routine use (a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Routine use (b)(2): Litigation Disclosure. OMB suggested that the Department clarify the routine use permitting
disclosure to counsel to clearly indicate that this routine use authorized disclosure only to opposing counsel.
OMB also asked that the Department clarify the distinctions among the various types of disclosures made under routine
use (b)(2). Routine use (b) has been restructured to address these concerns. OMB commented that a routine use was not
appropriate for disclosures to a court, as specified in (b)(2) of the notice, because these disclosures should be
made under a court order, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(11). Therefore, disclosure to courts has been removed from
this routine use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the commenters was concerned that disclosure to opposing counsel and other parties in administrative proceedings
under (b)(2) would be inappropriate because these disclosures should be obtained under a court order. The Assistant
Secretary disagrees because he believes that such a requirement would create an unnecessary burden on the public
and the Department. For example, if the Department is involved in administrative litigation with a school regarding
the school's default rate calculation, the school would have access to information pursuant to the program purpose
routine use. However, the school may need to disclose to its outside counsel certain individually identifiable information
obtained from the Department. Disclosure to the school's counsel in this case, in the interest of ensuring proper
adjudication of default rate challenges, would certainly be consistent with the purposes for which the records in
this system are maintained. However, if the school had to obtain a court order from the district court before it could
make such a disclosure, the administrative litigation would be unnecessarily burdened. Thus, the Assistant Secretary
has decided to keep in this routine use disclosures to opposing counsels and other representatives of parties in administrative
litigation with the Department.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Routine use (d): Contract Disclosure. This routine use has been rewritten to clarify its meaning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Routine use (e): Employee Grievance, Complaint or Conduct Disclosure. This routine use has been revised to make it
clearer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Routine use (f): Labor Organization Disclosure. It was suggested that the Department remove this routine use as unnecessary.
However, the Assistant Secretary foresees the possibility of a case in which a supervisor takes an action against
an employee and cites specific alleged mishandling of Privacy Act information by the employee as the basis for the
action. The employee is entitled to representation by a union representative who might need access to the individually
identifiable information in order to adequately protect the interests of the employee. This routine use is consistent
with the purposes of the system in that it ensures that questions about proper handling of confidential information
are properly addressed to the benefit of the individuals on whom the Department maintains information in this system
of records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Routine use (g): Research Disclosure. This routine use has been removed because 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(5) adequately covers
the needs intended to be served by this routine use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Routine use (i): FOIA Advice Disclosure. The Office of Management and Budget suggested that disclosure to OMB of individually
identifiable information be removed because the Department can obtain sufficient advice on Privacy Act matters
from OMB without disclosing individually identifiable information. The reference to OMB disclosures has been removed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Routine use (j): Subpoena Disclosure. This routine use is removed because it appears inconsistent with certain judicial
decisions relating to the Privacy Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the Safeguards clause for the system, the description of the safeguards has been rewritten to indicate
more precisely the nature of the safeguards used to protect this system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding the Retention and Disposal clause for the system, the details regarding optical disk storage as a means
of archiving data has been changed to clarify that the shelf life of the archived information will be enhanced through
an optical disk maintenance program and will be maintained for a total of ten years after the loan is closed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter was concerned about the timeframe for implementation of the NSLDS system and the enhancements to its
own system so that it can report information to the NSLDS. The commenter was also concerned that the Department appeared
to be making changes to data elements in the system and believed that the Department should continue to involve program
participants in the implementation strategies for NSLDS, including setting the appropriate implementation timeframes.
Contrary to the commenter's understanding, the data elements that will require system enhancements are not required
to be reported until July 1995, and the Department is now making changes to data elements that will be submitted to NSLDS.
The Department has worked closely with program participants during the design phase of this system and intends to
continue working closely with them.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All physical access to the sites of the contractor where this system of records is maintained, is controlled and monitored
by security personnel who check each individual entering the building for his or her employee or visitor badge. The
computer system employed by the Department of Education offers a high degree of resistance to tampering and circumvention
by use of software that requires user access to be defined down to the individual data element. This security system
limits data access to Department of Education and contract staff on a ``need to know'' basis, including external users
of the system (guaranty agency and school personnel) and controls individual users' ability to access and alter records
within the system. All users of this system are given a unique user ID with a personal identifier. The software monitors
and tracks changes to any data element. Any change to the database is recorded, together with the identity of the individual
user who made the change.

Take notice that on December 7, 1994, New England Power Company (NEP or the Company) filed amendments to its FERC Electric
Tariff, Original Volume No. 1, constituting a new rate, referred to as the W&hyph;95 rate, as well as a change in the
service agreement under that tariff with The Narragansett Electric Company (Narragansett) that would increase
the fixed credits to Narragansett. The W&hyph;95 rate would increase NEP's base rates for wholesale requirements
service by $131.3 million annually. NEP also filed a Stipulation and Agreement, under which NEP and other parties
agree to settlement rates, referred to as the W&hyph;95(s) rate, in lieu of the filed W&hyph;95 rate and a settlement
credit to Narragansett. Under the W&hyph;95(s) settlement rate, NEP's base wholesale revenues would not increase.
NEP proposes to make the settlement rates effective January 1, 1995. If the Commission does not accept the Stipulation
and Agreement, NEP proposes to make the W&hyph;95 rate and the revised credit to Narragansett effective February
5, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NEP states that copies of its filing have been served on all customers taking service under the tariff and on regulatory

December 14, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Take notice that on December 12, 1994, East Tennessee Natural Gas Company (East Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston,
Texas 77252, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;118&hyph;000 an application pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas
Act for a certificate of public convenience and necessity permitting it to construct and operate certain pipeline
loop and compression facilities to ensure continued transportation service to its shippers, all as more fully set
forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
East Tennessee proposes to construct and operate 2.14 miles of 12-inch pipeline loop and 3.02 miles of pipeline loop,
both in Washington County, Virginia as well as uprate three existing turbines at its Compressor Station No. 3110,
in Morgan County, Tennessee to Solar Saturn Model T&hyph;1300's, each with an I.S.O. rating of 1360 horsepower, resulting
in an increase of 960 horsepower. East Tennessee estimates a construction cost of $4,264,978, which would be financed
initially with funds on hand, funds generated internally, borrowing under revolving credit agreements or short-term
financing and which would be rolled into permanent financing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
East Tennessee states that its current total firm contractual commitment is approximately 476,507 dt equivalent
of natural gas per day. It is indicated that since 1988 East Tennessee's system has been designed to meet this obligation
in part by receiving approximately 5,000 dt equivalent of natural gas per day from Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation
(Columbia Gas) and delivering it to Roanoke Gas Company (Roanoke) via an interconnect between Roanoke and Columbia
Gas. It is stated that in 1988 East Tennessee and Roanoke entered into an operating agreement specifically providing
that approximately 5,000 dt equivalent of natural gas per day of Roanoke's total transportation quantity of 9,789
dt equivalent of natural gas per day could be delivered to Roanoke at the Columbia Gas interconnect. It is stated that
this arrangement enabled East Tennessee to reduce the volumes that it was required to transport on its system to Roanoke
and thus make those volumes available for East Tennessee's other customers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
East Tennessee states that the operating agreement has expired by its own terms and that Roanoke has advised that it
was not interested in extending the agreement. It is indicated that, as a result of terminated agreement, East Tennessee
now proposes to construct and operate the above-described facilities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before January
4, 1995, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest
in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211)
and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered
by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.
Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion
to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application
if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter
finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene
is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of
such hearing will be duly given.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for East Tennessee to appear
or be represented at the hearing.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given that an exemption to the land disposal restrictions under the 1984 Hazardous and Solid Waste
Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act has been granted to Merichem Company, for the Class I injection
well located at Houston, Texas. As required by 40 CFR part 148, the company has adequately demonstrated to the satisfaction
of the Environmental Protection Agency by petition and supporting documentation that, to a reasonable degree of
certainty, there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the injection zone for as long as the waste remains
hazardous. This final decision allows Merichem Company, to inject specific restricted hazardous wastes identified
in the exemption, into the Class I hazardous waste injection well at the Houston, Texas facility, for as long as the
basis for granting an approval of this exemption remains valid, under provisions of 40 CFR 148.24. As required by 40
CFR 124.10, a public notice was issued October 6, 1994. The public comment period ended on November 21, 1994. No comments
were received. This decision constitutes final Agency action and there is no Administrative appeal.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Good Neighbor Environmental Board was created by the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative Act of 1992. An Executive
Order delegates implementing authority to the Administrator of EPA. The Board is responsible for providing advice
to the President and the Congress on the need for implementation of environmental and infrastructure projects within
the States contiguous to Mexico in order to improve the quality of life of persons residing on the United States side
of the border. The Board is required to submit an annual report to the President and the Congress. The statute calls
for the Board to have representatives from U.S. Government agencies; the governments of the States of Arizona, California,
New Mexico and Texas; and private organizations with expertise on environmental and infrastructure problems along
the southwest border. The Board will meet at least twice annually.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Notice is hereby given that a request for reissuance of an exemption to the land disposal restrictions under the 1984
Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act has been granted to BP Chemicals,
for the Class I injection wells located at Port Lavaca, Texas. As required by 40 CFR Part 148, the company has adequately
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Environmental Protection Agency by petition and supporting documentation
that, to a reasonable degree of certainty, there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the injection
zone for as long as the waste remains hazardous. This final decision allows BP Chemicals to inject specific restricted
hazardous wastes identified in the reissued petition, into the Class I hazardous waste injection wells at the Port
Lavaca, Texas facility, for as long as the basis for granting an approval of this petition remains valid, under provisions
of 40 CFR 148.24. As required by 40 CFR 124.10, a public notice was issued on October 7, 1994. The public comment period
ended on November 21, 1994. EPA received no comments. This decision constitutes final Agency action and there is no
Administrative appeal.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Central Valley Reuse Project (CVRP) will be owned and operated by the Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility
Board (Board). Sponsoring agencies include Metropolitan Water District of Salt Lake City and the Salt Lake County
Water Conservancy District. The Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility is currently discharging its effluent
to the Jordan River. In October of 1991, the Utah Department of Environmental Quality, Division of Water Quality notified
the Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility Board that effluent discharged from their 62.5 million gallon per
day (mgd) trickling filter/solids contact waste water reclamation facility did not comply with ammonia limits for
discharge to the Jordan River. The Board subsequently contracted for the preparation of a feasibility study on ways
to meet the discharge requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed waste water reuse project would involve pumping effluent southward from the treatment facility located
in Salt Lake County, Utah for direct irrigation season discharge into existing agricultural irrigation canals.
An estimated 27,600 acre-feet per irrigation season may be delivered. These deliveries would serve to substitute
for contractual Utah Lake irrigation releases, allowing the displaced water to be retained in Utah Lake for a variety
of possible environmental enhancement projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will analyze the impacts of several alternative locations of pipelines required to deliver the effluent,
impact of use of the conserved water, and delivery points for the treated effluent. The impact of constructing a nitrification
unit (no action alternative) at the treatment plant will also be analyzed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public scoping process will be used to identify the significant issues to be addressed in the EIS, and identify
any additional alternatives or uses of the conserved water that should be considered. A scoping information summary
is available upon request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Beard Family Partnership (Applicant) has applied to the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an amendment
to their incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been
assigned Permit Number PRT&hyph;777083. The requested amendment, which is for a period not to exceed 30 years, would
authorize the incidental take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Dendroica chrysoparia
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). The proposed take would occur as a result of the construction of a residential development on 24 acres, in Austin,
Travis County, Texas. The proposed development will permanently impact about 24 acres of occupied and/or potential
endangered species habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has prepared an Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan (EA/HCP) for the incidental take

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Donating $90,000 for the purchase and dedication (to a conservation entity approved by the Service) of occupied
goldencheeked warbler habitat,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Providing operational and maintenance funds ($30,000) for the acquired preserve lands,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Revegetating developed areas with native vegetation, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Onsite dedication of conservation easements totalling 2.2 acres in occupied warbler habitat, with these
areas also containing populations of canyon mock-orange (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Philadelphus ernestii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), a candidate (C2) plant species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to what is proposed by the Applicant, the Service will require the Applicant to complete the following
activities as part of the permit conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Provide territorial mapping surveys for the warbler following International Bird Census Committee or other approved
procedures within and 500 feet out from the southern and western boundaries of Phase A, Section 3 in 1995 (where adjacent
landowners will allow). This area will be surveyed in 1996 and 1997 using the protocol established and in effect by
the Service for presence/absence surveys. This survey format of one territorial survey and two presence/absence
surveys will continue until the third breeding season after buildout of the project site, at which time a final territorial
mapping survey will be completed. Buildout for the residential area is considered to be when 95 percent of the houses
are constructed and occupied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The monies identified in the original PRT&hyph;777083 and this amendment must be conveyed to an entity approved
by the Service within 30 days of issuance of this amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. In order to offset the impacts of this development to the maximum extent reasonable and practicable, the Service
believes 48 acres of occupied habitat would be necessary to be purchased and maintained by the Applicant in the Bull
Creek or Cypress Creek watersheld in close proximity to other lands set aside for the conservation of the warbler.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Details of the mitigation proposed are provided in the Canyon Ridge. Phase A, Section 3 Environmental Assessment/Habitat
Conservation Plan. These conservation plan actions ensure that the criteria established for issuance of an incident
take permit will be fully satisfied.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant considered four alternatives, including an alternate site location, alternate site design, delaying
development until a regional section 10(a)(1)(B) permit is issued, and no action. Details of the mitigation are provided
in the Environmental Assessment/Habitat Conservation Plan for the Canyon Ridge, Phase A Development.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 -->
GPU Nuclear Corporation; Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant
Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DPR&hyph;16, issued to GPU Nuclear Corporation (GPUN/the licensee) for operation of the Oyster Creek
Nuclear Generating Station (OCNGS) located in Ocean County, New Jersey.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification 5.3.1.E to allow 2645 fuel assemblies to be stored in
the fuel pool. This is an increase of 45 fuel assemblies from the current limit of 2600. The 45 additional storage location
currently exist in the racks in the fuel pool. They were included in the re-racking project allowed by License Amendment
No. 76 but were not incorporated in the Technical Specifications since, at the time, it was believed they would not
be needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The operation of the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not
involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are no changes in the existing provisions for load handling in the vicinity of the spent fuel pool associated
with the proposed increase in licensed storage capacity. OCNGS Technical Specification 5.3.1.B limits the loads
carried over the spent fuel pool to no greater than the weight of one fuel assembly. Therefore, accidents involving
the mispositioning or drop of a fuel assembly establish the extent of accident probability or consequences. The Abnormal
Positioning of a Fuel Assembly Outside the Storage Rack and the Dropped Fuel Assembly accident scenarios are addressed
as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The probability of occurrence of the above accidents is not affected by the racks themselves or the stored fuel.
Since no physical changes are being made to the racks, an increase in licensed storage capacity cannot increase the
probability of these accidents.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The consequences of abnormal positioning of a fuel assembly outside the storage rack were evaluated. Since the
storage rack criticality calculations were made using an infinite array of storage cells with no neutron leakage,
positioning a fuel assembly outside and adjacent to the actual finite rack can add reactivity, but would, because
of neutron leakage, result in a lower K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 than the K
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=2 -->
oo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 calculated for the infinite array. Thus, additional stored fuel assemblies will not increase consequences of this
type of accident than those previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The consequences of a dropped fuel assembly striking either the base of the rack or the top of a storage location and
the reactivity effects were also evaluated in the licensing report supporting Amendment 76. In all cases, the evaluated
integrity of the racks was not exceeded. Also, the dropped fuel assembly did not constitute a criticality hazard because
the infinite multiplication factor of the fuel storage racks was not materially altered. An increase in fuel enrichment
does not increase consequences since the GE&hyph;9 assemblies' mechanical specifications are bounded by previous
designs and consequences are not dependent on U&hyph;235 enrichment. Thus, since no physical alteration of the storage
racks is necessary to store 45 additional fuel assemblies the consequences of this type of accident are not increased.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The operation of Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not create
the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The increase in licensed spent fuel pool storage capacity involves the addition of 45 fuel assemblies. The increased
structural loading has already been accounted for in the analyses reviewed by the NRC staff in support of Amendment
76. There are no physical changes to the fuel pool cooling. These systems are capable of handling the additional duty
originating from the additional fuel. Criticality accidents or malfunctions also do not change because the analysis
assumes an infinite array of fuel and Boraflex gaps have been conservatively accounted for. Therefore, there is no
possibility for an accident or malfunction of a different type than previously evaluated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The operation of Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station, in accordance with the proposed amendment, will not
involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The margin of safety, when applied to a storage expansion, needs to address nuclear criticality, thermal-hydraulic,
mechanical, material and structural adequacy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=3 -->
Nuclear Criticality
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
The acceptance criterion for criticality as established in Technical Specification 5.3.1.A, is that the neutron
multiplication factor shall be less than or equal to 0.95, including all uncertainties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the increase in licensed capacity to 2,600 storage locations, the maximum allowable average enrichment was
increased twice. The original analysis was for 3.01% U&hyph;235 enrichment fuel with no credit for Gd

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the rack installation, an industry concern was raised with the discovery of the formation of gaps in
Boraflex panels. The problem of gap formation in the boraflex and its impact on criticality has been addressed. The
criticality analysis was updated to take into account the presence of gaps, including projected gap formation is
coplanar. The fuel pool K

 rods at peak reactivity is 0.9174 and increases to 0.945 with 3.9 inch coplanar gaps in the Boraflex which is below the
0.95 limit. Oyster Creek maintains a Boraflex surveillance program to ensure the assumptions used in the analysis
remain valid.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since all criticality analyses were performed with an infinite lattice, it is valid for a spent fuel pool capacity
of 2,645 fuel assemblies. Therefore, there is no decrease in the margin of safety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The heat load analysis performed for the expansion to 2600 licensed storage locations considered all 2,645 actual
storage locations filled. Therefore, the initial conclusions are not changed and no re-analysis is required. The
thermal-hydraulic calculations which used 125
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F pool water temperature, have shown that the cladding temperatures (&lt;219
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F) will be well below the local fuel pool water saturation temperature of approximately 240
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F. The maximum cladding temperatures will be low enough to preclude nucleate boiling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analysis has demonstrated that with an abnormal heat load from 2,732 fuel assemblies in the spent fuel pool, the temperature
of the pool will be maintained within the Technical Specification limit to 125
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F. Therefore, since this limit will be maintained, other restrictions such as the temperature differential
of the spent fuel pool liner will also be maintained. Thus, there is no reduction in the margin of safety from a thermal-hydraulic
point of view.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
The additional 45 storage locations were part of the fuel pool expansion of which only 2,600 fuel assemblies were licensed
for storage. The fuel storage racks are designed to maintain the spent fuel assemblies in a safe configuration through
all environmental and abnormal loadings, such as an SSE or impact due to spent fuel assembly drop. Structural and seismic
analyses of the racks have established margins against tilting, deflection or movement to preclude impact of the
racks with each other or with the pool walls. It is shown that the rack modules will undergo infinitesimal rotations
if seismic excitation 50% over the SSE loading are imposed. The threshold of kinematic instability is not even approached.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analyses performed to arrive at the above conclusions indicate that margins in all areas of structural concern exist.
The racks are placed in the pool as individual stand-alone structures, do not load pool walls directly, and are uncoupled
from pool liner temperature rise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To limit the out-of-phase motion of adjacent racks due to non-symmetric loading of the racks, Oyster Creek procedures
for loading spent fuel pool racks require the racks to be loaded symmetrically, i.e. the total fuel assemblies stored
in any one quadrant of a rack will not deviate by more than 10% of the average of the four quadrants. This limitation will
remain in effect for storage of 2,645 fuel assemblies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the additional 45 fuel bundles in storage will not decrease structural margins since there is no associated
physical change to the storage facility and the 2,645 fuel assemblies were considered in the original analysis which
demonstrated that the acceptance criteria were met.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appear that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By January 19, 1995, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC, and at the local public document room located at the Ocean County Library, Reference Department, 101 Washington
Street, Toms River, New Jersey 08753. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above
date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission hereby provides notice that this is a proceeding on an application for a license amendment falling
within the scope of section 134 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA), 42 U.S.C. 10154. Under section 134 of
the NWPA, the Commission, at the request of any party to the proceeding must use hybrid hearing procedures with respect
to ``any matter which the Commission determines to be in controversy among the parties.'' The hybrid procedures in
section 134 provide for oral argument on matters in controversy, proceeded by discovery under the Commission's rules,
and the designation, following argument, of only those factual issues that involve a genuine and substantial dispute,
together with any remaining questions of law, to be resolved in an adjudicatory hearing. Actual adjudicatory hearings
are to be held on those issues found to meet the criteria of section 134 and set for hearing after oral argument.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's rules implementing section 134 of the NWPA are found in 10 CFR Part 2, Subpart K, ``Hybrid Hearing
Procedures for Expansion of Spent Nuclear Fuel Storage Capacity at Civilian Nuclear Power Reactors'' (published
at 50 FR 41670, October 15, 1985) to 10 CFR 2.1101 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Under those rules, any party to the proceeding may invoke the hybrid hearing procedures by filing with the presiding
officer a written request for oral argument under 10 CFR 2.1109. To be timely, the request must be filed within 10 days
of an order granting a request for hearing or petition to intervene. (As outlined above, the Commission's rules in
10 CFR Part 2, Subpart G, and 2.714 in particular, continue to govern the filing of requests for a hearing or petitions
to intervene, as well as the admission of contentions.) The presiding officer shall grant a timely request for oral
argument. The presiding officer may grant untimely request for oral argument only upon showing of good cause by the
requesting party for the failure to file on time and after providing the other parties an opportunity to respond to
the untimely request. If the presiding officer grants a request for oral argument, any hearing held on the application
shall be concluded in accordance with hybrid hearing procedures. In essence, those procedures limit the time available
for discovery and require that an oral argument be held to determine whether any contentions must be resolved in adjudicatory
hearing. If no party to the proceedings requests oral argument, or if all untimely requests for oral argument are denied,
then the usual procedures in 10 CFR Part 2, Subpart G, apply.

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an exemption from certain requirements
of its regulations to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;71, DPR&hyph;62, DPR&hyph;23, NPF&hyph;63, issued
to the Carolina Power &amp; Light Company (the licensee) for the operation of the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant,
Units 1 and 2 (Brunswick), H.B. Robinson Steam Electric Plant, Unit No. 2 (Robinson), and Shearon Harris Nuclear Power
Plant, Unit 1 (Harris).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facilities consist of two boiling water reactors at the Brunswick site in Brunswick County, North Carolina; a
pressurized water reactor at the Robinson site in Darlington County, South Carolina; and a pressurized water reactor
in Wake County and Chatham County, North Carolina.

Identification of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The exemption would allow implementation of a hand geometry biometric system of site access control so that photograph
identification badges can be taken offsite. The proposed action is in accordance with the licensee's application
for exemption dated July 29, 1994, as supplemented December 5, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
The Need for the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed action would give an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical
protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against radiological sabotage.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55(a), the licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security
organization. Paragraph 1 of 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' specifies that the ``licensee shall control
all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' Title 10 of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Code of Federal Regulations,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 paragraph 73.55(d)(5), specifies that ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals
who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' Paragraph 73.55(d)(5) also states that an individual
not employed by the licensee (i.e., a contractor) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided
the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from
the protected area.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, unescorted access into protected areas of the Brunswick and Robinson units is controlled through the
use of a photograph on a combination badge and keycard (hereafter, these are referred to as the badge). At the Harris
unit unescorted access into protected areas is controlled through the use of a photograph on a badge and a separate
keycard. The security officers at each entrance station use the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual
requesting access. The badges for both licensee employees and contractor personnel who have been granted unescorted
access are issued upon entrance at each entrance/exit location and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and
are retrievable at each entrance/exit location. In accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contract individuals are
not allowed to take badges offsite. In accordance with the plants' physical security plans, neither licensee employees
nor contractors are allowed to take badges offsite.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee proposes to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need
to issue and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access
to keep their badges with them when departing the site. An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to permit contractors
to take their badges offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed system, individuals who are authorized for unescorted entry into protected areas would have the
physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) registered with their badge number in the access control
system. When an individual enters the badge into the card reader and places the hand on the measuring surface, the system
would record the individual's hand image. The unique characteristics of the extracted hand image would be compared
with the previously stored template to verify authorization for entry. Individuals, including licensee employees
and contractors, would be allowed to keep their badge with them when they depart the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a Sandia report entitled ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices'' (SAND91&hyph;0276
UC&hyph;906 Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991) and on the licensee's experience with the current photo identification
system, the licensee demonstrated that the proposed hand geometry system would provide enhanced site access control.
Since both the badge and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected area, the proposed system would
provide for a positive verification process. Potential loss of a badge by an individual, as a result of taking the badge
offsite, would not enable an unauthorized entry into the protected area. The licensee will implement a process for
testing the proposed system to ensure continued overall level of performance equivalent to that specified in the
regulation. The Physical Security Plans for the Brunswick, Robinson, and Harris sites will be revised to include
implementation and testing of the hand geometry access control system and to allow licensee employees and contractors
to take their badges offsite.

The access will continue to be under the observation of security personnel. A numbered picture badge identification
system will continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escorts.
Badges will continue to be displayed by all individuals while inside the protected area.

With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed change does not affect nonradiological plant effluents
and has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.

Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed action and concludes that this proposed action would
result in no significant radiological environmental impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The change will not increase the probability or consequences of accidents, no changes are being made in the types of
any effluents that may be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulative
occupational radiation explosure. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological
environmental impacts associated with the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed action does involve features located entirely within
the restricted area as defined in 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other
environmental impact. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological environmental
impacts associated with the proposed action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Alternatives to the proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the Commission has concluded there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed action,
any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impact need not be evaluated. The principal alternative to
the action would be to deny the request. Such action would have no effect on the environmental impact, would not enhance
the protection of the environment, and would result in an unjustified loss of cost savings to the licensee.

Finding of No Significant Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant
effect on the quality of the human environment. Accordingly, the Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental
impact statement for the proposed action.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff has reviewed the proposed decommissioning against the requirements in 10 CFR Part 51. Upon conducting an
Environmental Assessment, the staff concluded that no significant environmental impacts are associated with the
proposed SAFSTOR and DECON decommissioning and that the proposed decommissioning will not significantly affect
the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the Commission has determined, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.13, not to prepare
an environmental impact statement for the proposed decommissioning of the YNPS.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Uruguay Round Trade Agreements Act (UR Act) renewed the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program until
July 31, 1995. The Statement of Administrative Action (SAA) that accompanies the UR Act provides that USTR will initiate
a review to determine whether any GSP beneficiary country affords preferential treatment, as a result of an economic
association agreement or otherwise, to the products of a developed country, other than the United States, that has,
or is likely to have, an adverse effect on U.S. commerce. This notice announces the review and invites public comments.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The GSP program offers duty-free access to the U.S. market for specified products that are imported from designated
developing countries. The GSP program is authorized by Title V of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``GSP law'')
(19 U.S.C. 2461 et seq.). The GSP law expired on September 30, 1994, but the UR Act extended the current GSP program without
modification until July 31, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the GSP program was originally enacted in 1974, the Congress was concerned about giving duty-free privileges
to some developing countries that, in turn, treat imports from some developed countries more favorably than imports
from the United States. Such favorable treatment is called a ``reverse preference,'' and it discriminates against
U.S. export interests.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, section 502(b)(3) of the GSP law provides that the President shall not designate a country as a GSP beneficiary
if the country ``affords preferential treatment to the products of a developed country, other than the United States,
which has, or is likely to have, a significant adverse effect on United States commerce.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Congressional and Administration concern about the adverse effect of discriminatory ``reverse preferences''
on U.S. commerce has been rekindled by recent complaints about ``reverse preferences'' that are allegedly granted
to imports from the European Union (EU) by some agreements between the EU and countries in Central and Eastern Europe.
Therefore, as provided in the SAA that accompanies the UR Act, the Administration intends to conduct a full review
of ``reverse preferences'' that may be granted by beneficiaries of the GSP program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
II. GSP Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The SAA provides that, upon enactment, USTR will initiate a GSP review to determine whether any GSP beneficiary grants
preferential treatment to imports from another developed country that has, or is likely to have, an adverse effect
on U.S. commerce. This review will consider ``reverse preferences'' granted by any GSP beneficiary, but it is expected
to focus principally, although not exclusively, on countries in Central and Eastern Europe that have association
agreements with the EU.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
USTR is directed to solicit public comments and to seek information from U.S. Embassies in GSP beneficiary countries.
Ninety days thereafter, USTR will determine whether the ``reverse preferences'' granted by a GSP beneficiary have
or may have an adverse effect on U.S. export interests sufficient to warrant further review. If so, USTR will enter
into bilateral consultations with that country with the goal of eliminating the ``reverse preferences.'' Nine months
later, USTR will make a determination of whether the ``reverse preferences'' have, or are likely to have, a significant
adverse effect on U.S. commerce.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If USTR makes an affirmative determination, the country's status as a beneficiary developing country will be withdrawn
or suspended, unless the country has agreed to eliminate the significant adverse effect. The review will terminate
if the determination is negative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
III. Public Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Interested parties are invited to submit comments regarding discriminatory ``reverse preferences'' that are granted
by a GSP beneficiary country, and their effect on U.S. commerce. Interested parties are invited to report on any association
agreements, or similar agreements, under which a GSP beneficiary country grants preferential treatment to products
of another developed country, that has or may have an adverse effect on U.S. export interests. Preferential treatment
may include preferential tariff treatment, as well as preferential non-tariff treatment (e.g., quotas). Interested
parties are urged to give specific examples of U.S. export interests that have been adversely affected by ``reverse
preferences.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In particular, interested parties are urges to be as specific as possible about: (1) Any product that is subject to
different rates of duty by a GSP beneficiary country depending upon whether the product is imported from the United
States or another developed country, such as the EU; (2) the various, actual, applicable rates of duty (i.e., bound,
applied, preferential), as well as any scheduled rate reduction; (3) the level of trade in the subject product that
the United States and other developed countries have with the GSP beneficiary; and (4) the size of the market in the
beneficiary country.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments must be submitted in 15 copies, in English, to the Chairman of the GSP Subcommittee, Trade Policy Staff Committee,
600 17th Street, N.W., Room 513, Washington, D.C. 20506. Comments must be received no later than 5 p.m. on Wednesday,
January 25, 1995. Information and comments will be subject to public inspection by appointment with the staff of the
USTR Public Reading Room, except for information granted ``business confidential'' status pursuant to 15 CFR 2003.6
and 2007.7. If the document contains business confidential information, 15 copies of a nonconfidential version
of the submission along with 15 copies of the confidential version must be submitted. The confidential version of
the submission should be clearly marked ``Submitted in Confidence'' at the top and bottom of each and every page of
the document. A nonconfidential summary of the confidential information must be included with the confidential
submission, along with a written explanation of why the confidential material should be protected. The version which
does not contain business confidential information (the public version) should also be clearly marked at the top
and bottom of each and every page (either ``public version'' or ``non-confidential'').

IV. Dominican Republic
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In the 1993 Annual GSP Review, the GSP Subcommittee reviewed the worker rights practices and the adequacy and effectiveness
of IPR protection in the Dominican Republic. Notwithstanding evidence of some progress on worker rights and IPR protection
in the Dominican Republic during the course of the review, these two cases are continued when the results of the 1993
Annual GSP Review were announced on July 1, 1994. Since that decision, the Dominican Republic has made considerable
progress on worker rights and has continued to make progress on IPR protection. In September, the Motion Picture Export
Association of America, the domestic petitioner in the IPR case, withdrew its petition. In October, the AFL&hyph;CIO,
the domestic petitioner in the worker rights case, withdrew its petition. Based on the continuing progress on worker
rights and IPR protection in the Dominican Republic, as well as the withdrawal of the two petitions, the GSP reviews
have been terminated.

Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange proposes to: (1) amend its listing guidelines for stock index and currency warrants, (2) establish various
new rules for the trading of stock index and currency warrants, and (3) establish special customer margin requirements
for positions in stock index and currency warrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Description of the Proposed Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CHX seeks to amend Article XXVIII, Rule 8 of the Exchange's rules to provide a higher standard for warrant issuers than
currently exists. Specifically, future warrant issuers would be expected to have a minimum tangible net worth in
excess of $150,000,000. Moreover, the aggregate original issue price of all of a particular issuer's warrant offerings
(combined with offerings by its affiliates) that are listed on a national securities exchange or on NASDAQ would not
be permitted to exceed 25% of the issuer's net worth. The proposed amendment will require that each warrant issue will
be automatically exercised on either the delisting date (if the issue is not listed upon another organized securities
market) or upon expiration. Article XXVIII, Rule 8 also will be amended to provide that, for stock index warrants where
25 percent or more of the value of the underlying index is represented by securities that are traded primarily in the
U.S., the opening prices of the U.S. traded securities in the index will be used to determine the settlement value of
the underlying index.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Article X, Rule 3 is being amended to apply the customer margin requirements used for broad based index and currency
options to index warrants and currency warrants, respectively. Thus, purchases of stock index and currency warrants
will require payment in full, and short sales of stock index warrants will require initial margin of: (i) 100 percent
of the current value of the warrant plus (ii) 15 percent of the current value of the underlying broad stock index less
the amount by which the warrant is out of the money up to a maximum of five percent of the index value. Short sales of currency
warrants similarly will follow the margin requirements applicable to listed currency options. The Exchange proposes
that the index and currency warrant margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered
positions.

or no-action relief from the Commission in order to permit its index and currency warrant margin requirements to allow
offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Article LI is being amended to add definitions related to the listing, trading, and margin requirements of stock index,
currency, and currency index warrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Part V of the Exchange rules applies to the trading of index warrants and currency warrants. Proposed Article
LIII, Rule 1 provides that, unless the context otherwise requires or a specific rule in Part V applies, the provisions
of the Constitution and all other rules and policies of the Exchange apply to trading of such securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Article LIII, Rule 2 states that no member or member organization shall accept an order from a customer for
the purchase or sale of an index or currency warrant unless the customer's account has been approved for options trading
pursuant to Exchange Article XXVIII, Rule 3.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Article LIII, Rules 3, 4, 5, and 6 require that the options rules for suitability, discretionary account
trading, supervision of accounts and customer complaints be applied to stock index and currency warrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Article LIII, Rule 7 requires approval by a Compliance Registered Options Principal of all advertisements,
sales literature and educational material issued by a member organization pertaining to stock index and currency
warrants. The rule further requires Exchange approval of all advertisements and educational materials pertaining
to stock index and currency warrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Article LIII, Rule 8 provides that position limits for stock index warrants on the same index with original
issue prices of ten dollars or less will be fifteen million warrants covering all such issues. In addition, with respect
to warrants on the Standard &amp; Poor's MidCap 400 Index, the position limit will be seven and one half million warrants
covering all such issues, provided the original issue prices of the warrants are not greater than $10. Further, with
respect to warrants on the Russell 2000 Index, the position limit will be twelve and one half million warrants. The
rule provides that warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or more will be weighted more heavily than warrants
with an original issue price of ten dollars or less in calculating position limits. The rule gives the Exchange the
authority to require the liquidation of a position in stock index warrants that is in excess of the position limits
set forth in the rule, and commentary to the rule provides procedures for allowing limited exceptions to the position
limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Article LIII, Rule 9 provides for exercise limits on stock index warrants analogous to those found in stock
index options and states that such limits are separate and distinct from any exercise limits that may be imposed by
the issuers of stock index warrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Article LIII, Rule 10, requires that the trading halt provisions in Article IX, Rule 10A shall be applied
to the trading of stock index warrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon SEC approval of the foregoing amendments, the Exchange proposes that it will only file rule changes for specific
warrant issues where there is no corresponding option or warrant on the same underlying index already listed on a national
securities exchange or NASDAQ. Accordingly, when a listed option or warrant overlies a particular broad based index,
the Exchange proposes it be able to list warrants on that index without further SEC review and approval pursuant to
Section 19(b) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants will require that no more than 20% of the securities
in the underlying index, by weight, may be comprised of foreign securities or American depositary receipts (``ADRs'')
overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the
CHX and the primary exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership providing
guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling
transactions in index or currency warrants.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 notice is hereby given that on October 21, 1994, the Midwest Securities Trust Company (``MSTC'') filed with the Securities
and exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items
have been prepared primarily by MSTC. The Commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comments from
interested persons and to grant accelerated approval of the proposed rule change.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

MSTC proposes to adopt a new automated book entry feature for municipal bonds.

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, MSTC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule
change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined
at the places specified in Item IV below. MSTC has prepared summaries, set forth in section (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the proposed rule filing, MSTC proposes to adopt an automated book entry movement feature to work in conjunction
with the Midwest Clearing Corporation's (``MCC'') interface
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 with the National Securities Clearing Corporation's (``NSCC'') fixed income transaction system (``FITS'') for
municipal securities.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The book entry movement feature for municipal securities transactions compared through FITS will be similar in functionality
and procedure to the current institutional delivery system where book entry delivery is set up in advance for automatic
settlement on settlement date. A municipal bond trade entered for comparison into FITS will be set up for automatice
book entry delivery once the trade achieves a compared status as long as the settlement date entered for the trade is
a date in the future of the trade date. New issue or unusual trade types that compare without a settlement date or items
that compare on or after settlement date will not be subject to automatice book entry delivery. These exception items
must be submitted manually.

Participants will have the flexibility to specify the position from which an automatic book entry delivery should
originate. MSTC expects that this decision often will be based on the most frequently used safekeeping position as
identified on the participant's account profile. Participants will have the option of changing this standing origination
location as necessary.

(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSTC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 17A(b)(3)(F)
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 of the Act requires the rules of a clearing agency be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement
of securities transactions. The Commission believes that the automated book entry delivery feature should help
promote prompt and accurate clearing and settlement by reducing errors by automatically generating book entry movements
on behalf of the delivering MSTC participants for compared trades. Section 17A(a)(2)(A)(i)
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 of the Act directs the Commission to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate
clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that the proposal furthers this goal
by creating cooperation by automating the process of trades being cleared and settled at Midwest Clearing Corporation
and MSTC.

MSTC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth
day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed
rule change because accelerated approval will allow MSTC participants to utilize and to take full advantage in a more
timely fashion of the benefits of the automated book entry movement feature for municipal securities.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSTC proposes to amend a portion of its services and the schedule of charges relating to the Legal Expert System. MSTC
also proposes to clarify its existing policy with respect to the use of the Legal Expert System by participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Legal Expert System is a computer program available to MSTC participants which details the necessary documentation
for effecting a legal transfer of securities based on industry criteria and individual state regulations. First,
MSTC wishes to clarify that the Legal Expert System is available only to full MSTC participants; accordingly, it is
not available to pledgee participants or limited purpose participants. Furthermore, the Legal Expert System is
proprietary to MSTC; therefore, participants may not provide third parties with access to the Legal Expert System
without MSTC's prior written approval. The new schedule of charges will be effective January 1, 1995.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 9, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The NYSE proposes (1) to add a new Rule 414 (Index and Currency Warrants) in order (a) to prescribe procedures for approving
and supervising accounts that trade currency warrants, currency index warrants and stock index warrants and (b)
to prescribe stock index warrant position and exercise limits, (2) to replace Supplementary Material .30 to Rule
405 (Diligence to Accounts), which contains provisions that the proposed rule change proposes to supersede, with
a cross reference to proposed Rule 414, (3) to amend existing Rule 431 (Margin Requirements) to modify currency warrant
and stock index warrant margin requirements and to establish currency index warrant margin requirements, (4) to
amend Para. 703.15 (Foreign Currency Warrants and Currency Index Warrants) of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual
to modify the listing standards for currency warrants and to establish listing standards for currency index warrants,
and (5) to amend Para. 703.17 (Stock Index Warrants Listing Standards) of the Exchange's Listed Company manual to
modify the listing standards for stock index warrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of proposed Rule 414 include (a) provisions governing the approval, supervision and suitability
of customers, which for the most part follow the Rules that the Exchange applies in respect of trading in stock index
options, and (b) stock index warrant position limits. It also includes a newly added stock index warrant exercise
limit. A more detailed discussion of the provisions of the proposed rule change follows.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) of Rule 414 defines relevant terms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) of Rule 414 specifies that the Rule applies to Exchange trading in currency warrants, currency index
warrants and stock index warrants and that other Exchange Rules and the Exchange's Constitution also so apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) of Rule 414 establishes position limits for stock index warrants. For a position of stock index warrants
with an original issue price of $10 or less, the position limit is 15 million index warrants. For a position of stock
index warrants with an original issue price in excess of $10, the number of such warrants is converted to the equivalent
number of warrants that the position would contain if the issuer had originally priced the issue at $10. Thus, 1 million
stock index warrants with an original issue price of $20 would represent the equivalent of 2 million stock index warrants
with an original issue price of $10 ($20/$10 &times; 1 million stock index warrants) and the 15 million stock index
warrant position limit would apply to the 2 million stock index warrant ``equivalents.'' Paragraph (c) also provides
procedures for allowing limited exceptions to those position limits as circumstances warrant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (d) of Rule 414 imposes exercise limits on stock index warrants equal to the position limits. The exercise
limits are separate and distinct from any limits the issuer of the stock index warrant may impose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) of Rule 414 applies the options rule counterpart to stock index warrant trading halts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (f) of Rule 414 requires a member or member organization to have approved an account for options trading
pursuant to the standards and procedures set forth in Rule 721 (Opening of Accounts) before the account can trade currency
warrants, currency index warrants and/or stock index warrants. Paragraphs (g), (h), (i) and (j) of Rule 414 apply
options rule counterparts to trading in currency warrants, currency index warrants and stock index warrants in the
areas of supervision of accounts (see Rule 722 (Supervision of Accounts)), suitability (see Rule 723 (Suitability)),
discretionary accounts (see Rule 724 (Discretionary Accounts)), and customer complaints (see Rule 732 (Customer
Complaints)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (k) of Rule 414 applies the options rule counterpart (see Rule 791 (Communications to Customers)) to communications
to customers relating to currency warrants, currency index warrants and/or stock index warrants. In addition, Paragraph
(k) requires those communications to state that currency warrants, currency index warrants and stock index warrants,
unlike standardized options, are subject to issuer's credit risks and warrant terms and conditions that may differ
from those that apply to other warrant issues overlying the same currency or index. The paragraph also advises that
the prospectus requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 apply to certain communications.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Paragraph (1) of Rule 414 requires that, where 25 percent or more of the value of an underlying index stock group is represented
by securities of United States issuers, the calculation of a stock index warrant's settlement value must use the opening
prices of those securities on the U.S. markets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supplementary Material .30 to Rule 405 is amended to cross-reference Rule 414 and to delete (a) the statement that
the suitability requirements of Rule 723 apply to stock index warrants and (b) the recommendation that the account
approval requirements of Rule 721 be applied to stock index warrants. Paragraphs (f) and (h) of Rule 414 supersede
those notions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange proposes to amend those portions of the Rule 431 margin requirements that apply to margin on foreign currency
options and options on broad index stock groups so as to apply the same margin requirements to currency warrants and
stock index warrants, respectively, and to establish currency index warrant margin requirements. For example,
stock index warrants will follow broad index options in requiring margin of (A) 100 percent of the current market value
of all ``long'' stock index warrants and (B) in the case of ``short'' positions in stock index warrants, (1) 100 percent
of the current value of the option plus (2) 15 percent of the current value of the underlying index stock group multiplied
by the applicable index multiplier. The Exchange proposes that its margin requirements be permitted offset treatment
for spread, straddle and covered positions.

The Staff of the Commission has indicated to the Exchange that it must request and obtain appropriate interpretive
or no-action relief from the Commission in order to permit its index and currency warrant margin requirements to allow
offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions.

The Exchange proposes to amend Para. 703.15 of the Listed Company Manual, which currently provides listing standards
for foreign currency warrants, to cause it to apply to currency index warrants. The Exchange also proposes to amend
Para 703.15 and Para. 703.17 of the Listed Company Manual (A) to change the issuer ``substantiality'' requirement
for $100 million in assets to $150 million in tangible net worth, (B) to specify that the issuer is expected to refrain
from issuing warrants where its aggregate currency and index warrant offerings exceed 25 percent of its net worth
and (C) to require in-the-money currency and index warrants to be automatically exercised at expiration if not otherwise
exercised.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In listing new stock index warrant or currency index warrant issues for trading on the Exchange, the Exchange would
submit a proposed rule change only where a warrant issue overlies an index on which warrants or options are not already
listed, whether on the Exchange or on another self-regulatory organization. Thus, an Exchange would list for trading
index warrants on indexes that already underlie listed options or warrants without further Commission review and
approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants
will require that no more than 20% of the securities in the underlying index, by weight, may be comprised of foreign
securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the NYSE and the primary
exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership providing
guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling
transactions in index or currency warrants.

in securities, and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general,
to protect investors and the public interest.

The NYSE is proposing amendments to Para. 203.02 of its Listed Company Manual (the ``Manual'') regarding the mailing
of interim financial statements to shareholders of listed companies. The rule, as amended, would state that corporations
that distribute interim reports to shareholders should distribute such reports to both registered and beneficial
shareholders.

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, the Exchange requires listed companies to publish interim earnings statements as press reports, but
does not require that such statements also be sent to shareholders. The practices of listed companies vary: Some companies
mail these reports to all shareholders, some mail only to registered holders, and some companies do not mail interim
reports at all.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Various groups, including the American Society of Corporate Secretaries and the Securities Industry Association,
have been reviewing this area in an attempt to achieve some uniformity among listed companies with respect to their
dissemination of interim earnings reports to shareholders. In balancing the benefit of requiring that these reports
be mailed to all shareholders, and the high cost of doing so, particularly as to ``street name'' holders, a compromise
position developed. While companies would continue not to be required to mail interim reports to shareholders, if
a company did conduct such a mailing, it was believed to be fair that such reports be mailed to both registered and beneficial
holders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The compromise position is proposed as an amendment to Para. 203.02 of the Manual in the discussion of reporting and
disclosure by listed companies.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on September 22, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit
comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange proposes to: (1) Amend its listing guidelines for stock index (``stock index'' or ``index'') warrants
and currency warrants (``currency warrants'');
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 (2) establish various new rules for the trading of stock index and currency warrants; and (3) establish special customer
margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency warrants. On Dec. 5, 1994, the PSE amended certain surveillance
related matters addressed in the filing. See footnote 3,

II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item
IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Section (A), (B), and (C) below,
of the most significant aspects of such statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PSE proposes to: (1) Amend its listing guidelines and establish uniform rules for the trading of stock index and
currency warrants, and (2) establish special customer margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency
warrants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PSE seeks to amend Rule 7.18 to provide higher standards for warrant issuers than currently exists. In particular,
future warrant issuers would be expected to have a minimum tangible net worth in excess of $150 million. In addition,
the aggregate original issue price of all of a particular issuer's warrant offerings (combined with offerings by
its affiliates) that are listed on a national securities exchange or that are National Market securities traded through
NASDAQ would not be permitted to exceed 25% of the issuer's net worth. The proposed amendment will require that each
warrant issue will be automatically exercised on either the delisting date (if the issue is not listed upon another
organized securities market) or upon expiration. Rule 7.18 also will be amended to provide that opening prices (``a.m.
settlement'') for all U.S. traded securities will be used to determine an index's settlement value where 25 percent
or more of the value of the index is represented by securities whose primary trading market is in the U.S. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 2.16 is being amended to apply the current customer margin requirements for broad based stock index and currency
options to stock index and currency warrants, respectively. Thus, purchases of stock index and currency warrants
will require payment in full, and short sales of stock index warrants will require initial margin of: (i) 100 percent
of the current value of the warrant plus (ii) 15 percent of the current value of the underlying broad stock index less
the amount by which the warrant is out of the money up to a maximum of five percent of the index value. Short sales of currency
warrants will follow the margin requirements applicable to listed currency options. The Exchange proposes that
its stock index and currency warrant margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and
covered positions.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Proposed Rule 8 of the Exchange rules applies to the trading of index warrants and currency warrants. Proposed Rule
8.1 provides that, unless the context otherwise requires or a specific provision of Rule 8 applies, the provisions
of the Constitution and all other rules and polices of the Exchange apply to trading of such securities.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The staff of the Commission has indicated to the Exchange that it must request and obtain appropriate interpretive
or no-action relief from the Commission in order to permit its index and currency warrant margin requirements to allow
offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed Rule 8.4 states that no member or member organization shall accept an order from a customer for the purchase
or sale of index or currency warrants unless the customer's account has been approved for options trading pursuant
to Exchange Rule 9.18(b). Furthermore, proposed Rules 8.5&hyph;8.8 require that the option rules pertaining to
suitability, discretionary account trading, supervision of accounts and customer complaints be applied to stock
index and currency warrants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Rule 8.9 requires approval by a Compliance Registered Options Principal of all advertisements, sales literature
and educational material issued by a member organization pertaining to stock index and currency warrants. The rule
further requires Exchange approval of all advertisements and educational materials pertaining to stock index and
currency warrants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Rule 8.10 provides that position limits for stock index warrants on the same index with original issue prices
of ten dollars or less will be fifteen million warrants covering all such issues. The rule provides that warrants with
an original issue price greater than ten dollars will be weighted more heavily than warrants with an original issue
price of ten dollars or less in calculating position limits. The rule also gives the Exchange the authority to require
the liquidation of a position in stock index warrants that is in excess of the position limits set forth in the rule,
and Commentary to the rule provides procedures for allowing limited exceptions to the position limits.

Proposed Rule 8.11 provides for exercise limits on stock index warrants analogous to those found in stock index options
and states that such limits are separate and distinct from any exercise limits that may be imposed by the issuers of
stock index warrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Rule 8.12 requires that the trading halt provisions in Rule 7.11 shall be applied to trading in stock index
warrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon Commission approval of the foregoing amendments, the Exchange proposes it will only file rule changes for specific
warrant issues where there is no corresponding option or warrant on the same underlying broad based index already
listed on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ. Accordingly, when a listed option overlies a particular broad
based index, the Exchange proposes it be able to list warrants on that index without further Commission review and
approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants will require that no more than 20% of the securities
in the underlying index, by weight, may be comprised of foreign securities or American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'')
overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the
PSE and the primary exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, Commentary .01 to Proposed Rule 2.16 provides that stock index and currency warrants listed on the Exchange
prior to SEC approval of this filing shall continue to be governed by those provisions of the Exchange's rules that
were applicable to such warrants prior to approval of this filing. Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants,
the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership providing guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities
(including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in index or currency warrants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Purpose of this rule change is to: (1) amend listing guidelines for stock index and currency warrants, (2) amend
various rules thereby extending their applicability to index and currency warrants trading, and (3) establish special
customer margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency warrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Phlx seeks to amend its listing standards for currency and index warrants. Phlx Rule 803(e) will provide that issuers
must have a minimum tangible net worth in excess of $150 million. In addition, the aggregate original issue price of
all of a particular issuer's stock index or currency warrant offerings (combined with offerings by its affiliates)
that are listed on a national securities exchange or on NASDAQ would not be permitted to exceed 25% of the issuer's net
worth. The proposed amendment will also provide for automatic exercise of warrants upon expiration and that opening
prices will be used to determine the settlement value of an underlying index.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Exchange Rule 722 is being amended to apply the customer margin required for broad based index and currency options
to stock index and currency warrants, respectively. Thus, purchases of stock index and currency warrants will require
payment in full, and short sales of stock index warrants will require an initial margin of 100 percent of the current
value of the warrant plus 15 percent of the current value of the underlying index, less the amount by which the warrant
is out of the money, up to a maximum of five percent of the index value. Short sales of currency warrants similarly will
follow the margin requirements applicable to listed currency options. The Exchange proposes that its index and currency
warrant margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and covered positions.

Exchange Option Rules 1024, 1025, and 1070 concerning opening of accounts, supervision of accounts, and customer
complaints will all be made applicable to index and currency warrants. Presently, Exchange Rule 1026 and 1027 respecting
suitability and discretionary accounts for option transactions already are applicable to index and currency warrants.

Rule 1049 respecting written customer communications about listed options will apply to index and currency warrants
and require approval by a Compliance Registered Options Principal of all advertisements, sales literature and educational
material issued by a member organization pertaining to stock index and currency warrants. The Rule further requires
Exchange approval of all advertisements and educational materials pertaining to stock index and currency warrants.

Rule 1001 is being amended to provide that index warrants on the same index with original issuer prices of ten dollars
or less will be 15 million warrants covering all such warrant issues and that warrant issues with an original issue
price over ten dollars will be weighted more heavily than warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or less.
Rule 1002 is being amended to provide that the exercise limits for index warrants will be analogous to those found in
stock index options and that such limits are separate and distinct from any exercise limits imposed by the issuer of
such warrants.

Upon Commission approval of the foregoing amendments, the Exchange proposes that it will only file rule changes for
specific warrant issues where there is no corresponding option or warrant on the same underlying index already listed
on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ. Accordingly, when a listed option or warrant overlies a particular broad
based index, the Exchange proposes that it be allowed to list warrants on that index without further Commission review
and approval pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants will require that no more than 20% of the securities
in the underlying index, by weight, may be compromised of foreign securities or American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'')
overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the
Phlx and the primary exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded.

 Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants, the Exchange will distribute a circular to its membership providing
guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities (including suitability recommendations) when handling
transactions in index or currency warrants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Phlx, pursuant to Rule 19b&hyph;4 of the Act, proposes to adopt an examinations fee applicable to Phlx member and
participant organizations for which the Exchange is the Designated Examining Authority (``DEA''), effective January
1, 1995. The following Phlx member/participant organizations would be exempt from the examinations fee: (1) Inactive
organizations; (2) organizations that operate from the Exchange's trading floors; (3) organizations for any month
where they incur transaction or clearing fees charged directly to them by the Exchange or by its registered clearing
subsidiary, provided that the fees exceed the examinations fee for that month;
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and (4) organizations affiliated with an organization exempt from this fee due to the second or third category.

The $1,000 threshold is required in order for a firm to be exempt from the examinations fee. For example, a firm with
$600 in transaction fees for a month is required to pay the full amount of the $1,000 examinations fee. See letter from
Gerald D. O'Connell, First Vice President, PHLX, to Glen Barrentine, Branch Chief, SEC, dated December 12, 1994 (``Letter'').

organization continues to have no revenue each month.

examination fee.

1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Commission Rule 15b2&hyph;2(b) requires that broker-dealers designated to a self-regulatory organization (``SRO'')
be examined for compliance with applicable financial responsibility rules within six months of registration with
the Commission. In addition, the examining SRO must conduct an examination within 12 months of Commission registration
to review compliance with all other Commission rules. Thereafter, examinations are conducted on a periodic basis.
In accordance with Commission rules, the Phlx administers an examinations program conducting reviews of organizations
for which the Exchange is the DEA. The examinations focus on an organization's compliance with applicable financial
and record keeping requirements, including net capital, books and record maintenance, Regulation T and financial
reporting, of the Phlx as well as the Commission.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Examinations Department incurs certain costs in the course of conducting these examinations, including travel
and staff costs. Of course, such costs rise when the offices of the organization being reviewed are located outside
of the Philadelphia area. Staff time required to conduct an examination is substantially longer when the businesses
of the firm are atypical of those firms for which the Phlx has historically served as DEA. Because of the familiarity
that inherently results from repeatedly conducting similar examinations, Phlx Examinations staff has accumulated
substantial experience regarding where to focus and locate information revealing potential areas of concern.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Exchange is currently the DEA for approximately one dozen firms that engage in Phlx-atypical businesses
from remote locations. The Phlx is the DEA for firms located in other geographic regions, which do not transact business
on the Exchange, and trade products not available on the Phlx. For instance, a Chicago-based firm conducting proprietary
trades in government securities and a Connecticut-based firm engaged in convertible debt securities arbitrage
are examples of atypical Phlx firms. The heightened costs, which include both money as well as valuable staff time,
may be due to an atypically lengthy examination, travel and specific training regarding non-Phlx trading instruments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to actual costs incurred in conducting required examinations, the Exchange notes that, as the DEA for
a firm, the Phlx, similar to other SROs, also frequently performs an advisory role respecting the regulatory obligations
of its member/participant firms. This ``service'' function may take the form of answering telephone calls and other
questions of such firms regarding Exchange and Commission rules, as well as the types of procedures such firm should
have in place. Initially, becoming a member/participant firm of the Phlx, the Exchange assists in the firm's set-up
of its financials and communicates with the firm, providing sample forms and general guidance. Thereafter, a firm
may require periodic follow-up advice. These advisory costs to the Exchange of serving as the DEA are greater for the
Phlx-atypical firms.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, these heightened costs may be offset by transaction charges and related revenues received by the Exchange
if such firms trade in Phlx markets. In reviewing these costs, the Exchange notes that Phlx member/participant organizations
may be required to pay various fees and transaction charges, which usually constitute a large part of the revenue collected
by the Exchange. Organization not trading on the Phlx escape these fees, while the Exchange remains obligated to administer
various regulatory functions, including costlier examinations. In the area of examinations, the factor of staff
time is particularly pronounced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some cases, these firms do not engage in business on the Phlx, and, consequently, the heightened costs are not offset
by revenues derived from these firms. Without this income source, the Exchange has determined to adopt an examinations
fee in order to alleviate certain costs of conducting examinations. Currently, the Phlx does not charge an examinations
or DEA fee, noting, in contrast, that most other SROs in the U.S. impose direct examinations fees.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 For the above reasons, therefore, the Phlx is proposing such a fee for those organizations for which it serves as DEA_with
certain exceptions. The proposed examinations fee would apply primarily to those member and participant organizations
which do not execute trades on the Phlx.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
The Chicago Board Options Exchange imposes a fee equal to $.40 per $1,000 in gross revenues. Other exchanges similarly
impose revenue-based examinations fees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to fairly allocate the proposed examinations fee, the Exchange has determined to exempt those member and
participant organizations that actively trade on the Exchange, thereby counterbalancing examination costs with
transaction fees. Organizations that for any month incur transaction or clearing fees charged directly to them by
the Exchange or by its registered clearing subsidiary would be exempt from the fee, provided that the fees exceed the
examinations fee for that month. Inactive organizations would be exempt because examinations are not customarily
conducted for such organizations. Compliance with the inactive status will be determined by gross securities-related
transaction revenues reported on the organization's most recent semi-annual FOCUS report. In addition, the organization
must continue to lack such revenues, as determined monthly, in order to be exempt from the examinations fee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, a member or participant organization that is wholly owned by, controlled by, or under common control with
an organization operating from the Phlx trading floor or generating counterbalancing Phlx transaction or clearing
fees would be exempt from this fee, because the affiliated organization is generating transaction or clearing fees
to help offset examinations costs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Basis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act in general, and in particular, with Section 6(b)(4),
in that it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among its members and issuers
and other persons using its facilities. The Exchange believes that the proposed examinations fee of $1,000 per month
is reasonable in view of the Exchange's costs in conducting examinations of non-Phlx-trading organizations, especially
in terms of staff time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange also believes that structuring the fee to exempt organizations that transact business on the Exchange
represents an equitable allocation of the Exchange's examination costs among members by focusing on those member
organizations that generally do not otherwise continually contribute to compensating for, and usually, in fact,
increase Exchange examination costs. The Exchange notes that the fee becomes effective January 1, 1995.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on November 7, 1994, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below,
which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization.

On December 7, 1994, the PHLX withdrew the portion of the proposal requesting approval to list cash/spot foreign currency
options in consecutive month and cycle month series. In addition, the PHLX requested accelerated approval for the
portion of the proposal concerning holiday expirations and the definition of ``underlying foreign currency.''
See Letter from Michele R. Weisbaum, Associate General Counsel, PHLX, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Division
of Market Regulation, Commission, dated December 5, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). Under Amendment No. 1, the contract
listed on December 19, 1994, will be effected on Friday, December 23, 1994, will not be effected by the new procedure.

I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PHLX proposes to amend PHLX Rule 1000, ``Applicability, Definitions, and References,'' to provide that the expiration
date for cash/spot foreign currency options (``3D options'') that expire on a holiday or an Exchange designated bank
holiday will be the business day following the holiday or the Exchange designated bank holiday. In addition, the PHLX
proposes to amend PHLX Rule 1000(b)(14) to correct the definition of ``underlying foreign currency'' as it applies
to 3D options. Under the proposal, the 3D option contract listed on December 19, 1994, will be effected by the proposed
expiration procedure, but the 3D contract expiring on Friday, December 23, 1994, will not be effected by the proposed
expiration procedure.

II Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The PHLX proposes to amend its rules to make two changes to its 3D options. Presently, 3D options expire every Monday
at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. PHLX Rule 1000(b)(21)(iii), ``Expiration Date,'' provides that if Monday is
a holiday or Exchange designated bank holiday, 3D options will expire on the preceding business day. The Exchange
also trades physically settled foreign currency options that expire on the Friday preceding the third Wednesday
of each month (``mid-month options'') and on the last Friday of each month (``month-end options''). the PHLX states
that the Exchange created 3D options with a Monday expiration to attract users seeking an option capturing the risk
associated with the weekend.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to existing PHLX Rule 1000(b)(21)(iii), if Monday is a holiday, the expiration reverts back to the preceding
business day, which is usually Friday but on some occasions may be Thursday. The Exchange now realizes that this defeats
the purpose of using 3D options to capture weekend risk. In response to this concern, which has been raised by users
of the product, the Exchange proposes that 3D options expire on the following business day, instead of the previous
business day, when the regular Monday expiration occurs on an Exchange holiday or designated bank holiday. This usually
will be a Tuesday, however, it may be a Wednesday. For example, Monday, December 26, 1994, is an Exchange holiday, (Christmas)
so expiration, as proposed, should be Tuesday. However, Tuesday, December 27, 1994, is a designated bank holiday
(Boxing Day), so expiration would occur on Wednesday, December 28, 1994, if the proposed ``next business date'' rule
were in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the PHLX proposes to revise the definition of ``underlying foreign currency'' to reflect that for 3D
options which are cash settled, the underlying foreign currency is the currency that the Options Clearing Corporation
(``OCC'') would have been obligated to sell or purchase upon exercise of the contract since OCC actually transfers
the cash value upon exercise of the foreign currency.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6 of the Act, in general, and, in particular
with Section 6(b)(5), in that it is designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade and to protect investors
and the public interest by providing both a more appropriate expiration date for 3D options when the expiration date
falls on a holiday.

III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange has requested that the proposed rule change be given accelerated effectiveness pursuant to Section
19(b)(2) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act of the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5).
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The PHLX state that the Exchange created 3D options with a Monday expiration in order to attract investors seeking
an option that captures weekend risk. Under current rules, however, if Monday is a holiday or designated bank holiday,
the 3D options will expire on the preceding business day, which is usually the preceding Friday. By amending its rules
to provide that 3D options will expire on the following business day when the regular expiration Monday is an Exchange
holiday or designated bank holiday, the Commission believes that the proposal will accommodate the investment objectives
of market participants and facilitate transactions in 3D options by providing investors with a means to capture weekend
currency risk.

The Commission believes that 3D options, as amended, should provide investors with greater flexibility to tailor
foreign currency options positions to satisfy their investment objectives. In this regard, the Commission notes
that the PHLX has stated that foreign currency options provide a strategic investment tool for sophisticated retail
options customers, multi-national corporations, and proprietary traders who manage and hedge foreign currency
exposure, as well as banks, which trade short-term FCOs to hedge the risks of trading in the foreign currency forward
and cash markets.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 In addition, the Commission continues to believe that 3D options broaden the hedging opportunities of foreign currency
market participants by providing them with an alternative to using futures contracts, forward contracts and/or
off-exchange customized derivative instruments to satisfy their short-term currency investment needs.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission believes that the proposal to revise the definition of ``underlying foreign currency'' clarifies
the definition in the context of 3D options by reflecting the fact that the OCC delivers the cash value, rather than
the underlying currency, upon exercises of a 3D option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of
publication of notice of filing thereof in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in order to allow the Exchange to implement the new holiday expiration procedure prior to the January 2, 1995, expiration,
an Exchange holiday. The Commission believes that the proposal to amend the holiday expiration procedure for 3D options
will allow investors to continue to use 3D options for the purpose of hedging weekend currency risk. In addition, the
Commission notes that the PHLX has notified its members of the proposed change and that the Commission has received
no comments on the proposal. The Commission also believes that it is appropriate to grant accelerated approval to
the proposal to revise the definition of ``underlying foreign currency'' because the proposal clarifies the Exchange's
rule without making any substantive change. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections
6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve the proposed rule change on an accelerated basis.

In its filing with the Commission, the Amex included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Amex proposes to: (1) Amend its listing guidelines and establish uniform rules for the trading of stock index and
currency warrants; and (2) establish special customer margin requirements for positions in stock index and currency
warrants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex seeks to amend Section 106 of the Amex Company Guide to provide higher standards for index and currency warrant
issuers than currently exists. In particular, such issuers would be expected to have a minimum tangible net worth
in excess of $150 million. In addition, the aggregate original issuer price of all of a particular issuer's warrant
offerings (combined with offerings by its affiliates) that are listed on a national securities exchange or that are
National Market securities traded through NASDAQ would not be permitted to exceed 25% of the issuer's net worth. The
proposed amendment requires that each warrant issuer will be automatically exercised on either the delisting date
(if the issue is not listed upon another organized securities market) or upon expiration. Section 106 also will be
amended to provide that opening prices (``a.m. settlement'') for all U.S. traded securities will be used to determine
an index's settlement value where 25 percent or more of the value of the index is represented by securities whose primary
trading market is in the U.S.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rule 462 is being amended to apply the current customer margin requirements for broad based stock index and currency
options to stock index and currency warrants, respectively. Thus, purchases of stock index and currency warrants
will require payment in full, and short sales of stock index warrants will require initial margin of: (i) 100 percent
of the current value of the warrant plus (ii) 15 percent of the current value of the underlying broad stock index less
the amount by which the warrant is out of the money, up to a maximum of five percent of the index value. Short sales of currency
warrants will follow the margin requirements applicable to listed currency options. The Exchange proposes that
its stock index and currency warrant margin requirements be permitted offset treatment for spread, straddle and
covered positions.

Proposed Part VI of the Exchange rules applies to the trading of index warrants and currency warrants. Proposed Rule
1100 provides that, unless the context otherwise requires or a specific rule in part VI applies, the provisions of
the Constitution and all other rules and policies of the Exchange apply to trading of such securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Rule 1101 states that no member or member organization shall accept an order from a customer for the purchase
or sale of index or currency warrants unless the customer's account has been approved for options trading pursuant
to Exchange Rule 921. Accordingly, the Exchange will rescind Commentaries .01 and .02 to Rule 411, its current suitability
standard applicable to warrants, which currently provide that the Exchange ``recommends'' that index and currency
warrants only be sold to investors whose accounts have been approved for options trading. Furthermore, proposed
Rules 1102&hyph;1105 require that the option rules pertaining to suitability, discretionary account trading,
supervision of accounts and customer complaints be applied to stock index an currency warrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Rule 1106 requires approval by a Compliance Registered Options Principal of all advertisements, sales
literature and educational material issued by a member organization pertaining to stock index and currency warrants.
The rule further requires Exchange approval of all advertisements and educational materials pertaining to stock
index and currency warrants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Rule 1107 provides that position limits for stock index warrants on the same index with original issue prices
of ten dollars or less will be fifteen million warrants covering all such issues. In addition, with respect to warrants
on the Standard &amp; Poor's MidCap 400 Index, the position limit will be seven and one-half million warrants covering
all such issues, provided the original issue prices of the warrants are not grater than ten dollars. The rule provides
that warrants with an original issue price of ten dollars or more will be weighted more heavily than warrants with an
original issue price of ten dollars or less in calculating position limits. The rule also gives the Exchange the authority
to require the liquidation of a position in stock index warrants that is in excess of the position limits set forth in
the rule, and Commentary V to the rule provides procedures for allowing limited exceptions to the position limits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed Rule 1108 provides for exercise limits on stock index warrants analogous to those found in stock index options
and states that such limits are distinct from any exercise limits that may be imposed by the issuers of stock index warrants.

index warrants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon Commission approval of the foregoing amendments, the Exchange proposes that it will only file rule changes for
specific warrant issues where there is no corresponding option or warrant on the same underlying index already listed
on a national securities exchange or NASDAQ. Accordingly, when a listed option overlies a particular broad based
index, the Exchange proposes it be allowed to list warrants on that index without further Commission review and approval
pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both initial and maintenance listing standards for stock index warrants will require that no more than 20% of the securities
in the underlying index, by weight, may be comprised of foreign securities or American depositary receipts (``ADRs'')
overlying foreign securities that are not subject to comprehensive surveillance sharing agreements between the
Amex and the primary exchange on which the foreign security (including a foreign security underlying an ADR) is traded.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Furthermore, proposed Rule 1100 provides that stock index and currency warrants listed on the Exchange prior to SEC
approval of this filing shall continue to be governed by those provisions of the Exchange's rules that were applicable
to such warrants prior to approval of this filing. Finally, prior to trading index or currency warrants, the Exchange
will distribute a circular to its membership providing guidance regarding member firm compliance responsibilities
(including suitability recommendations) when handling transactions in index or currency warrants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the
objectives of Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and
practices and to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and is not designed to permit unfair discrimination
between customers, issuers, brokers and dealers.

Background.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In May 1993, a self-regulatory organization task force (``Task Force'') was formed by the AMEX, CBOE, MSRB, NASD,
NYSE, and PHLX, which included 12 representatives from a wide range of broker-dealers, to study the continuing education
needs of the securities industry. In September 1993, the Task Force issued a report recommending a formal two-part
continuing education program that would require uniform, industry-wide, periodic training in regulatory matters
and ongoing training programs conducted by firms to keep their employees updated on job and product-related subjects.
The Task Force also recommended that a permanent Council on Continuing Education, composed of broker-dealer and
SRO representatives, be formed to develop the content and provide ongoing maintenance of the continuing education
program. Pursuant to this recommendation, the Securities Industry/Regulatory Council on Continuing Education
(``Council'') was formed in September 1993, with representatives from six SROs and 13 broker-dealers. The Council
prepared draft rules to implement the continuing education program, which the SROs have filed as proposed rule changes
with the Commission.

See proposed AMEX Rule 341A; proposed CBOE Rule 9.3A; proposed CHX Article VI, Rule 9; proposed MSRB Rule G&hyph;3(h);
proposed Schedule C to the NASD's By-Laws, Part XII; proposed NYSE Rule 345A; proposed PHLX Rule 640; and proposed

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule changes would codify the Task Force's recommendations, enable uniform implementation of the continuing
education program, and provide a means for the SROs to monitor and enforce the program's requirements. The proposal
provides for a two-part continuing education program consisting of a Regulatory Element requiring uniform, periodic
training in regulatory matters and a Form Element requiring firms to maintain ongoing programs to keep their employees
up-to-date on job and product related subjects.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Regulatory Element.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Satisfaction of the Regulatory Element would require all registered persons (unless exempt) to complete a prescribed
training program after their second, fifth, and tenth registration anniversary dates.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The Regulatory Element would be administered using computer-based interactive training techniques and would consist
of standardized subject matters covering generally compliance, ethics, and sales practice issues. Failure to complete
the program within prescribed time-frames (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 within 120 days after the occurrence of the applicable registration anniversary date, or as otherwise determined
by the SROs) would result in a person's registration being deemed inactive and that person being prohibited from performing
the functions of a registered person until such time as the person has completed the program. The SRO will terminate
administratively the registration of anyone who is inactive for two years, provided that upon application and a showing
of good cause, the SRO may allow a registered person additional time to satisfy the program requirements.

Any registered person who has terminated his or her association with a member and who, within two years of the date of
termination, becomes reassociated in a registered capacity with a member, would be required to participate in the
Regulatory Element at such intervals (two, five, and 10 years) as would apply based upon the individual's initial
registration anniversary date rather than the date of reassociation in a registered capacity.

Persons registered for more than 10 years as of the effective date of the rule would not have to satisfy the Regulatory
Element requirements. Persons registered for 10 years or less as of the effective date of the rule would be required
to satisfy the Regulatory Element and complete the computer-based training program after the occurrence of the next
relevant registration anniversary date and on any applicable registration anniversary date(s) thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A registered person who has completed all or part of the regulatory Element of the program or otherwise is exempt from
participation therein would have to reenter the Regulatory Element in the event he or she is subject to certain disciplinary
actions. Such individual would have to complete the computer-based training program within 120 days of such reentry
and at two, five and 10 years thereafter. The following disciplinary events would trigger such reentry:

to enhance the securities knowledge, skills, and professionalism of their registered sales, trading, and investment
banking personnel who have direct contact with customers, and for the immediate supervisors of such persons. Members
would be required to prepare training plans taking into consideration the organization's size, organizational
structure, and scope of business activities, as well as regulatory developments and the performance of covered persons
in the Regulatory Element. At a minimum, programs used to implement a member's training plan must be appropriate for
the business of the members and must cover the following matters concerning securities products, services, and strategies
offered by the member: General investment features and associated risk factors; suitability and sales practice
considerations; and applicable regulatory requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Members would be required to review and, if necessary, update their training plans annually. The SROs may require
their members, either individually or as part of a group, to provide specific training in any areas the SROs deem necessary.
Persons subject to the training plan would have an affirmative obligation to participate in the programs identified
by the member. Finally, members would be required to maintain records documenting the content of their training programs
and the completion of the program by registered persons covered under the plan.

 The SROs intend that the requirements of the Regulatory Element portion of the continuing education program become
effective on July 1, 1995, and that the Firm Element be implement in two steps whereby members would be required to have
completed their Firm Element plans by July 1, 1995, and have implemented their plans no later than January 1, 1996.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The SROs believe that their respective proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges, national securities associations,
and the MSRB and, in particular, the respective requirements of Sections 6(b)(5), 15A(b)(6), and 15B(b)(2)(C) of
the Act.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Sections 6(b)(5), 15A(b)(6), and 15B(b)(2)(C) require, among other things, that the rules of an exchange, and association,
or the MSRB, respectively, be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to
and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors
and the public interest. The SROs further believe that their proposed rule changes also are consistent with the respective
provisions of Sections 6(c)(3)(B), 15A(g)(3)(A), and 15B(b)(2)(A) of the Act,
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 each of which makes it the responsibility of an exchange, an association, or the MSRB to prescribe standards of training,
experience and competence for persons associated with SRO members.

1. Comments Received by the NASD
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On August 15, 1994, the NASD published Special Notice to Members (``NTM'') 94&hyph;59 to request member comment regarding
the Council's draft rules to create a mandated continuing education program for the securities industry. Thirty-three
comment letters were received in response. Twenty-six letters were from financial services firms, four from trade
associations, two from firms active in the continuing education field, and one was from the NASD's District 1. Five
of the letters were opposed to the NASD's proposal, while the remaining letters either expressed support for, or were
not opposed to, the proposal. As discussed below, the proposed rules that the SROs have filed with the Commission have
been revised from the Council's original draft rules to address some of the commenters' concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three letters from financial services firms question the usefulness of the Regulatory Element. The first, from a
firm that limits its business primarily to wholesaling mutual funds, stated that the Regulatory Element creates
more problems than it solves, costs too much, and would have the effect of fostering a negative attitude towards regulation.
The second letter requests that the Regulatory Element be tailored to the specific products and services provided
by each member. The third letter questions the use of the disciplinary fine threshold with respect to the re-entry
provision, and believes the 10 year grandfather provision should be shortened in some cases. The writer concludes
that the securities industry should model its program after state insurance continuing education programs, where
the licensing authority imposes the regulatory requirement directly on the individual, rather than on the firm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three letters from financial services firms express concern that the Regulatory Element of the program would be administered
at testing centers operated by the NASD. The request that firms be allowed to administer the Regulatory Element in-house,
subject to appropriate controls.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three letters support the goals of the Regulatory Element, but raise concerns about its specific focus. One letter
suggests that the Regulatory Element be divided into two separate units, one for commissioned brokers and one for
registered persons operating in a no-load environment. One letter suggests that this part be divided based on the
registration category of the individual and the membership of the individual's firm. The third commenter believes
that the Regulatory Element should relate to the daily activities of the largest number of registered persons possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three letters address concerns regarding the statistics that would be generated from the Regulatory Element. All
three letters seek specific information on the types of statistics that would be available. Two of the letters express
concern that the NASD has not enuniated clearly the intended and acceptable uses of these statistics.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two letters from financial services firms seek a clearer definition of ``inactive status'' as used in the Regulatory
Element. The letters have questions regarding the disposition of monies earned, but not paid, prior to inactive status,
and the allowable level of interaction between an individual on inactive status and his or her member firm. One writer
asks whether inactive status should be treated as a disciplinary event, while the other writer believes that the rules
should state clearly that inactive status is in no way a disciplinary event.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters address the re-entry provisions of the Regulatory Element. These concerns range from technical
wording of the re-entry provision, to stating that the fine threshold is unfair with respect to technical violations
and ambiguous in cases where several individuals are held jointly and severally liable, to stating that the provision
regarding disciplinary actions is overly harsh. One commenter believes that the provision allowing the SEC, SROs,
and state regulators to require a registered person to re-enter the Regulatory Element should be deleted, or at least
changed to require a showing of cause.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter believes that Central Registration Depository (``CRD'')
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 support would help firms comply with the Regulatory Element. Specifically, CRD could be used by firms to identify
registered persons and their length of service to determine how many of their registered persons would be subject
to the Regulatory Element in each of the next few years.

Commission.

One letter offers broad insights and recommendations for a continuing education program, but does not contain specific
reactions to the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four letters were received from financial services firms that expressed concerns regarding the costs of complying
with the Firm Element. Generally, these firms state that the Firm Element could have a disproportionately burdensome
effect on smaller firms, as compared to larger ones. To mitigate these effects, the commenters suggest that the NASD
prepare and administer training programs, or, alternatively, that subsidies be provided to smaller firms to help
them comply with the Firm Element. Another commenter recommends a video via satellite program that would enable firms
to secure qualified speakers, and be assured that the material provided would comply with the Firm Element. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two letters regarding the Firm Element have questions about those to whom it would apply. The first letter asks whether
municipal securities brokers fall under the definition of ``covered persons'' for this part of the program. The second
asks whether the Firm Element applies to sales assistants who are registered persons, or whether an accommodation
for such persons could be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five letters comment on the standards for the Firm Element. The first commenter asks how and what information should
be maintained regarding the program and offers suggestions. The second commenter believes that the Firm Element
should focus on suitability, and favors some form of pre-approval regarding the contents of a firm's program. The
third commenter asks whether a firm may include relevant compliance matters in the Firm Element so that it may meet
its ``annual compliance interview/meeting'' requirement under the NASD Rules of Fair Practice. The fourth commenter
believes that the Firm Element content requirements are too vague to ensure proper compliance. The fifth commenter
questions the usefulness of feedback from the Regulatory Element in developing an appropriate Firm Element. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two financial services firms comment on the provision allowing the NASD to require members to undertake specific
training. The first letter seeks a definition of the phrase ``class of covered registered person,'' stating that
such a class should be clearly identifiable by firms. The second letter states that to grant the NASD discretion to
mandate specific training for certain individuals or groups could have potentially arbitrary results that could
place certain firms at a competitive disadvantage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four industry associations submitted letters in response to the proposal. Two associations, the Securities Industry
Association (``SIA'') and the Security Traders Association (``STA''), are comprised almost entirely of people
potentially affected by the proposal. The other two, The Association for Investment Management and Research ``AIMR'')
and the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards (``CFP''), are active in the continuing education field and
have many members who are potentially affected people. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The STA strongly supports the proposal, and expresses its desire to help implement the program. The SIA also supports
the program, but believes that several of its aspects merit further consideration. The SIA believes that the NASD
and the Council should develop standards to determine when registered persons may be required by regulators to re-enter
the Regulatory Element, and the power of the NASD arbitrarily to prescribe specific training for a member firm. The
SIA also supports in-house administration of the Regulatory Element, with appropriate controls. Lastly, the SIA
seeks clearer guidelines to determine the adequacy of a given Firm Element training program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the AIMR and the CFP each endorse the proposal, both are concerned about overlap for individuals who hold
their designations and are also subject to this proposal. Both groups desire to work with the Council to minimize the
impact caused by the overlap between the proposed rules and the existing requirements of the AIMR and CFP on individuals
who would be subject to both regimes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two parties that are active in the continuing education field responded to the proposal, the Securities Education
Institute, Inc. (``SEI''), and the American Institute for Continuing Education (``AICE''). Both focus on the differences
between the proposed program and programs that already exist in the insurance industry. Both seek more information
regarding the Firm Element so as to help NASD members and independent training providers meet the program requirements.
The SEI believes that administration of the Regulatory Element should not be limited to the NASD testing centers or
to those firms with the proper in-house delivery means. Instead, interactive programs similar to those the SEI provides
to the futures industry should be used (these would include safeguards already authorized by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NASD District 1 supports the proposal and offers two suggestions. First, with respect to the Regulatory Element,
the commenter suggests that the sections relating to ``Requirements'' and ``Re-entry into Program'' be amended
to make it clear that the time frame of the Regulatory Element is 10 years, not 15. Regarding the Firm Element, the commenter
asks who the ``Specific Training'' provision would operate (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at what level of the NASD would such decisions be made). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments submitted on NTM 94&hyph;59 were reviewed by the Council and by the NASD Membership Committee. Neither
the Council nor the Membership Committee agreed with those commenters who opposed instituting a continuing education
program for the securities industry, believing that it is in the best interest of the investing public and the industry
to proceed with the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Membership Committee made three technical changes to the rule as originally proposed in NTM 94&hyph;59. First,
the language in Section (1)(a)(i) of the NASD's proposal was redrafted to state clearly that registered persons must
participate in the Regulatory Element of the continuing education program on three occasions, after the occurrence
of their second, fifth, and tenth registration anniversary dates. Second, Section (1)(b) of the NASD's proposal
has been expanded to state that a registration that is inactive for a period of two calendar years would be terminated
administratively, and that a person whose reregistration is so terminated must requalify by taking the Series 7 examination
before such person's registration could be reactivated. Finally, Section (1)(c)(iii) of the NASD's proposal was
amended to clarify that the Commission, a state securities regulator, or an SRO could require re-entry into the program
only as a result of a sanction in a formal disciplinary action. This change is meant to address the concerns of those
commenting on the due process issues that could arise were regulatory authorities able to mandate re-entry arbitrarily.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NASD Membership Committee did not respond to other recommendations made by commenters. The Committee believes
that it is unnecessary to state explicitly that inactive status under the Regulatory Element of the program is not
a disciplinary action. Explanatory materials on this point would accompany the notice to members announcing the
effectiveness of the rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters suggested that member firms be permitted to administer the Regulatory Element in-house. The
Council and the SROs will continue to study this issue and will formulate a final response for the industry in the future.
The program, however, initially would be implemented only in the NASD's testing centers. The Membership Committee
believes this to be necessary to allow the NASD to manage the introduction of the program in a reasonable manner. The
technology and administrative issues that arise with respect to the in-house administration of the Regulatory Element
will require further study to be resolved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, some commenters questioned the use of a single computer-based training program in a Regulatory Element
for all persons within the first 10 years of their initial registration. The Membership Committee and the Council
recognized that there are variations in function and degree of involvement in the securities industry among the approximately
500,000 individuals registered as representatives. Both the Council and the NASD Membership Committee believe
that the initial computer-based training program should deal with the most important compliance and regulatory
concerns confronting the industry, and that these matters are important for all segments of the securities industry.
The Council, the Membership Committee, and the other SROs would continue to review the need for more specialized computer-based
training programs for different segments of the industry. In the future, these groups may recommend that such programs
be introduced, but only after further assessing the experience with the initial single computer-based training
program.

2. Comments Received by the MSRB
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In August 1994, the MSRB published its proposal for comment, and subsequently received five comment letters.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that its dealer department is a two-person operation and the proposed Firm Element is an unreasonable
burden to be placed on such a small operation. The Firm Element Committee of the Council is developing materials for
dealers' use in devising and carrying out training programs to meet the requirements of the Firm Element. The Committee
intends to incorporate ``samples'' of how different firms might approach the requirements (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, firms that deal with one product, small firms, and firms with large numbers of very small offices or solo representatives).
The MSRB believes this future guidance would assuage the concerns of small firms as to the burden of compliance with
this requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, a municipal securities broker's broker, asked whether it would be subject to the Firm Element requirements.
The Firm Element is applicable to all persons who conduct business with retail, institutional, or investment banking
customers of the dealer and the immediate supervisors of such persons. The Firm Element is not applicable to dealers
who deal only with other brokers and dealers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the MSRB has not shown that a continuing education program is needed in the industry. Another
commenter expressed similar concerns. The Task Force formed by the securities industry to study the issue of continuing
education and to develop recommendations concluded that the industry would be will served by a uniform continuing
education program. The MSRB believes that a formal industry-wide continuing education program to keep professionals
up-to-date on products, markets, and rules would be beneficial to the municipal securities industry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter sent the same comments to the MSRB and the NASD. These comments have been summarized above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The MSRB also received two telephone inquiries from bank dealers concerning the planned procedure for the CRD system
to track and communicate an individual's registration anniversary date for use with the Regulatory Element. Bank
dealer personnel are not registered on the CRD system. The MSRB has discussed this notification matter on an informal
basis with the bank regulatory agencies. Such agencies have stated that they would probably require banks to put procedures
into place for internal tracking of anniversary dates.

3. Comment Received by the NYSE
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NYSE received one letter from a member organization commenting on its proposal. The commenter endorsed the computer-based
training of the Regulatory Element, but recommended that such training be required upon an individual's initial
registration, in addition to the required three occasions thereafter (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, after the second, fifth and tenth registration anniversary dates).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NYSE believes that the continuing education program has been designed to apply to registered persons after they
have satisfied the initial qualification requirements and that two years after a person's initial registration
and qualification is an appropriate time to reinforce significant general regulatory and sales practice concepts
and provide training on recent rule and other current developments through the continuing education process.

The other SROS have not solicited, and do not intend to solicit, comments regarding the proposed rule change. They

have made, or intend to make, changes to their proposals to conform to changes made by the other SROs in response to comments

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FHWA and the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), in cooperation with the Town of Southeast,
with input from the County of Putnam, will be preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS) on a proposal to improve
New York State Route 22. The proposed improvement will involve the reconstruction of the existing route from the northern
terminus of Interstate 684 to Putnam County Route 65, Putnam Lake Road, a distance of 2.9 miles. Also under consideration
in this proposal is construction of a grade separated interchange at Putnam County Route 54, Milltown Road.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The project proposes to improve traffic operation and safety on the existing route. The proposed action is consistent
with the NYSDOT transportation improvement program for the Route 22 corridor, between Interstate Route 684 and Route
55, which has been studied by the FHWA and NYSDOT since 1980. In 1990, the Route 22 Corridor Development Study_Final
Project Development Report was completed. the Corridor Development Study identified existing traffic operation
and safety problems, projected significant future increases in traffic demand, identified needed highway improvements
and recommended in implementation plan. Improvement of Route 22 between Interstate Route 684 and County Route 65,
Putnam Lake Road, was recommended, as were other improvements within the corridor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatives under consideration include (1) taking no action, (2) expanding the existing two-lane highway to four
lanes with a flush median and improved intersections; (3) expanding the existing two-lane highway to four lanes divided
by a median barrier and with turning lanes at intersections; and (4) congestion management system strategies. Variations
to horizonal and vertical alignment and the possible provision of an interchange at Milltown Road will also be studied
with the various build alternatives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on studies done to date, issues that need to be analyzed in depth include the impacts on noise, air and water quality,
cultural resources, floodplains, and adjacent right of way. The project's effect on features such as Bog Brook Reservoir
and East Branch will also be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Letters describing the proposed action and soliciting comments will be sent to appropriate Federal, State and local
agencies, and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed interest in this proposal. If
necessary, a scoping meeting will be held with involved Federal, State and local agencies. A public information meeting
will be held after additional study. The EIS will be made available for agency and public review and comment, after
which a public hearing will be held. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that the full range of issues related to the proposed action are addressed and all significant issues identified,
comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties. Comments or questions concerning this proposed
action and the EIS should be directed to the FHWA or NYSDOT at the addresses provided above.

Chrysler Corporation; Grant of Application for Renewal of Temporary Exemption From Three Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chrysler Corporation of Highland Park, Michigan, applied for a renewal of NHTSA Temporary Exemption No. 92&hyph;1,
expiring August 31, 1994 (57 FR 27507) which was granted covering three Federal motor vehicle safety standards, for
electric-powered multipurpose passenger vehicles (``TEVan''). As of June 10, 1994, the company had produced 52
TEVans under the exemption. Its application for renewal was accompanied by a copy of its original petition, and NHTSA
interpreted this action as an indication that the company intended to repeat its original requests and arguments.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of the application was published on August 3, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 39631). This
notice grants a renewal of the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TEVan is an electrically driven version of the Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager multipurpose passenger vehicle.
If the exemption is renewed, modifications will be made to production Dodge and Plymouth vans manufactured between
September 1, 1994 and August 31, 1996. Although a successor to the current van will be introduced within this time frame,
``electric conversions of that new platform will not be ready for production initially'' and Chrysler is planning
``to produce the current TEVan versions until the new electric conversion units are ready for introduction.'' The
TEVan was developed in cooperation with the Electric Power Research Institute, U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium,
and the United States Department of Energy. The basis for the petition was that a temporary exemption would facilitate
the development and field evaluation of a low-emission motor vehicle within the meaning of 49 CFR 555.6(c). The vehicles
use electric motors powered by nickel-iron or other equivalent batteries that replace the internal combustion engine.
According to Chrysler, the TEVans meet the California Air Resource Board zero emission requirements, and are low-emission
vehicles as defined by section 123(g) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (now 49 U.S.C. 30113(a)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The TEVan differs from regular production vans as follows: The internal combustion engine, transmission, coolant
system, power brakes, gasoline fuel system, and power steering system have been replaced by an electric drive motor,
a nickel-iron or equivalent battery pack, a micro-processor based battery management system, a controller-converter-charger
unit, a two-speed manual/automatic transmission, and electric-motor-driven pumps for the vacuum power brakes
and the hydraulically assisted power steering. Finally, the hot water heater/defroster unit is replaced by an electric
resistance type heating/defrosting system.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The TEVan is based on production vehicles certified as complying with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety
standards. However, it does not comply with the portions of the standards indicated below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Standard No. 101, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Controls and Displays. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
S5.1. The TEVan is equipped with a state-of-charge gauge to serve as an indicator of reserve battery power, rather
than the fuel gauge required by the standard. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Standard No. 102, Transmission Shift Lever Sequence, Starter Interlock, and Transmission Braking Effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
S3.1.2. The requirement for transmission braking effect is met by regenerative braking, in which the electric motor
becomes a generator, recharging the batteries and dissipating energy in the process. Regenerative braking can be
switched off at the option of the driver to restore steering control on slippery surfaces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
S3.1.3. The starter interlock mechanism is deleted since there will be no electric starting motor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
S3.1.4. The automatic transmission shift mechanism is replaced with an electric switch control device that operates
in a similar manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Standard No. 105, Hydraulic Brake Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
S5.1. The performance of the service brake system is predicated on the use of the regenerative characteristic of the
drive motor to augment the power-assisted hydraulic wheel brakes. The motor, driven through the transmission by
the mass of the coasting vehicle, functions as a generator to dissipate energy through charging the drive batteries.
Chrysler has never conducted tests using regenerative braking, however, tests of a conventionally powered weighted
simulation of the TEVan indicate that the TEVan will meet the stopping distance requirements of S5.1.1. In the fade
and recovery test, S5.1.4, the distance specified between the starting points of successive brake applications
at 60 mph is 0.4 mile. The TEVan cannot accelerate to 60 mph in that distance, so the test cannot be conducted as prescribed,
but based on the performance of a simulated TEVan, the TEVan could comply if it could accelerate as specified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On TEVans equipped with anti-lock brake systems, the regenerative braking is disabled during hard stops that actuate
the anti-lock feature of the brakes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the original petition, an exemption would facilitate the development and field evaluation of a low-emission
motor vehicle by enabling the petitioner to develop the electric drive motor, battery controller, battery, and other
subsystems to increase the efficiency and durability of future generations of electric vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner requested extension of its exemption for a two-year period beginning September 1, 1994. In its original
petition it argued that the exemptions will not unduly degrade the safety of the vehicles because the vehicles from
which the TEVan is adapted are certified as conforming to the standards. Chrysler observes in its petition for renewal
that its ``field experience to date would indicate no negative result if this extension was granted.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, petitioner originally argued that granting the exemption would be in the public interest and consistent
with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act because it would accelerate the development of electrically-driven
vehicles and related technology which could help to reduce the dependency on foreign oil. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No comments were received on the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to grant the renewal of an exemption originally provided under 49 U.S.C. 30113(b)(3)((B)(iii) (formerly
15 U.S.C. 1410(a)(1)(C)), the Administrator must find that the temporary exemption would ``make the development
or field evaluation of a low-emission motor vehicle easier and would not unreasonably lower the safety level of that
vehicle,'' and that the exemption is consistent with the public interest and 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301 Motor Vehicle Safety.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The applicant has argued that the exemption would enable it to continue to develop the components of the vehicle to
increase the efficiency and durability of future generations of electric vehicles. NHTSA concurs with this argument.
It is probable that an exemption would permit the use of the vehicles under varied conditions of climate and terrain,
testing those components for durability and life. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioner has also argued that safety is not compromised because the vehicles from which the TEVan is adapted are
certified as conforming to the standards. The inability of the TEVan to meet two of the standards from which exemption
is requested, Standards Nos. 101 and 102, appears only technical in nature, as systems and instruments are provided
that are the equivalents of those in gasoline-powered vehicles. As for Standard No. 105, the petitioner on the basis
of simulated tests of weighted vehicles, judges that the stopping distance requirements will be met. It is NHTSA's
experience that regenerative braking can provide a drag on the vehicle's forward motion when the foot is removed from
the accelerator; this, coupled with foot brake activation should ensure adequate stopping capability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is manifestly in the public interest to accelerate the development of electrically-driven vehicles, not only
to reduce reliance on oil, no matter where it originates, but also to reduce the level of harmful emissions in the environment.
Because of the minimal impact on safety of the renewal of this exemption, NHTSA considers that an exemption is consistent
with the objectives of Chapter 301.

<DOCTITLE>Ford Motor Company; Decision of Inconsequential Noncompliance</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Ford Motor Company (Ford) of Dearborn, Michigan decided that some of its windows failed to comply with the labeling
requirements of 49 CFR 571.205, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 205, ``Glazing Materials,'' and
filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Ford also applied
to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on
the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of receipt of the application was published on October 3, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59
FR 50329). This notice exempts Ford from the notification and remedy requirements of the statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard No. 205, which incorporates, by reference, the American National Standards Institute's ``Safety Code
for Safety Glazing Materials for Glazing Motor Vehicles Operating on Land Highways'' Z&hyph;26.1&hyph;1977, January
26, 1977, as supplemented by Z26.1a, July 3, 1980 (ANS Z26.1), specifies that typical automotive tempered glass with
a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent shall be labeled ``AS3.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford manufactured approximately 1,820,000 quarter windows with a luminous transmittance of less than 70 percent
for use in 1986 through 1994 model year Ranger Supercab and Mazda B-series Cab Plus vehicles. These windows were labeled
``AS2'' instead of ``AS3.'' Approximately 7,900 were located and scrapped. The remaining windows were used in vehicle
production or provided to aftermarket distributors for service replacement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ford supported its application for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
[Ford believes that t]he incorrect marking presents no risk of accident or injury. The windows can be installed only
as rear quarter windows in Ranger Supercab trucks; AS2 and AS3 glazing are both appropriate for these applications
in accordance with Standard 205. In Ford's judgement, the mismarking is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety. The stated purposes of FMVSS No. 205 are to reduce injuries resulting from impact to glazing surfaces, to ensure
a necessary degree of transparency in motor vehicle windows for driver visibility, and to minimize the possibility
of occupants being thrown through vehicle windows in collisions. As previously noted the affected quarter windows
fully comply with the performance requirements of FMVSS No. 205. Because all performance requirements are met, the
incorrect marking of the quarter windows has no effect upon the ability of the glazing to perform in the manner intended
by the standard. Ford is not aware of any complaints, accidents, or injuries related to this condition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The mismarking should not cause confusion in glass replacement in vehicles in service. Aftermarket distributors
do not use the marking to determine which glazing is used for replacement. Rather, replacement parts are determined
by service part numbers which are obtained from cataloged listings. Further, we are not aware of any confusion in aftermarket

NHTSA has considered these arguments and has found them persuasive. Because FMVSS No. 205 permits either AS2 or AS3
glazing to be used in the rear quarter location, the use of mislabeled glazing in those areas will have no safety impact.
The fact that the windows can be used only in that location and not in other locations where use of AS3 glazing would be
inappropriate confirms this conclusion.

Accordingly, for the reasons expressed above, the applicant has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance
herein described is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety, and Ford Motor Company is hereby exempted from providing
notification and remedy with respect thereto.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Internal Revenue Service is redesigning business and work processes to improve the way we use technology to maximize
the availability of information resources. This will require long-term, continuous improvement to product quality,
productivity, and customer satisfaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One of the strategies to implement this change is Compliance 2000. This is a mission-based philosophy of tax administration
that emphasizes taxpayer education and assistance coupled with a more focused use of enforcement resources. Compliance
2000 will address making the tax system easier for taxpayers to comply voluntarily, yet recognizes that despite the
Service's best efforts some people will not voluntarily respond. One goal of Compliance 2000 is to identify and address
causes of noncompliance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This system presently includes records relating to information gathering to identify noncompliance with the Internal
Revenue Code. Enhancements are being added to the system to enable the Internal Revenue Service to identify causes
of noncompliance. These enhancements will be accomplished by use of an automated information system to form an integrated,
on-line resource network. Instead of each function or level within a geographical area addressing isolated or systemic
compliance or business issues on its own (National, Regional, District, or Service Center), we will approach business
from a more unified perspective to provide one-stop information to compliance personnel within a local area and greatly
reduce the need for separate contracts with outside sources. Data will be drawn from the Audit Information Management
System (AIMS)_Treasury/IRS 42.008; the Individual Master File (IMF)_Treasury/IRS 24.030; the Business Master
File (BMF)_Treasury/IRS 24.046; the Returns Compliance Programs File_Treasury/IRS 26.016; the Taxpayer Delinquent
Accounts Files (TDA)_Treasury/IRS 26.019; Taxpayer Delinquency Investigation (TDI) Files_Treasury/IRS 26.020;
Wage and Information Returns Processing (IRP) System_Treasury/IRS 22.061; the International Enforcement Program
Files_Treasury/IRS 42.017; the Case Management and Time Reporting System_Treasury/IRS 46.002; and from the Centralized
Evaluation and Processing of Information Items_Treasury/IRS 46.009. In addition, data will be drawn from other
third party sources. As an example, these third party sources may include commercial sources, state and local agencies,
construction contract information, license information from state and local agencies, Currency and Banking Reports
(CBRS), data regarding assets and financial transactions from state and local agencies, and information on significant
financial transactions from reviews of periodicals and local newspapers, and other media sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The system of records notice is being amended to give a more definitive description of the records that are to be included
in the system. This notice will also reflect the change to consolidate this new information within each geographical
location and for on-line access to this information on a need-to-know basis. There will be additional authorized
users within each local area network.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Internal Revenue Service will develop and maintain database and retrieval systems accessed through automated local
area networks. The purpose of these systems will be to combine information from sources inside and outside the IRS,
such as motor vehicle data, business license data, currency and banking data (CBRS), commercial database information,
into a centralized processing unit which will serve as a comprehensive compliance network for each district, service
center, region, etc. These databases would be available for use by all IRS functions on a need-to-know basis. As an
example, a database may be configured to identify a particular grouping or market segment of taxpayers and their assets
in a more efficient and effective manner than is presently available. Previously this was not possible because of
the format and configuration of the original databases. For example, in addition to taxpayer data from the system
of records listed herein, this system may include on-line access to such information as the Currency and Banking Retrieval
System (CBRS), any state's Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV), Credit Bureau information, real estate ownership
information, and commercial databases.

The Internal Revenue Service has adopted a mission-based philosophy to increase voluntary compliance with the tax
laws of the Internal Revenue Code. In order to accomplish this, we will be focusing more on research and analysis techniques
as opposed to case-by-case enforcement in order to determine key areas of non-compliance. The IRS will approach these
areas with a more unified perspective instead of addressing isolated or systemic compliance of business issues on
national, regional or local levels. The IRS will also address major broad-based issues that affect compliance and
will lead to better tax administration.
