SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) is adopting the interim final rule which was published on October 19, 1994,
as a final rule without change. The rule provides policies and procedures, required under subsections (c)(3) of section
21A of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, for the marketing of properties under the Affordable Housing Disposition Program
(AHDP). The rule is necessary because the Resolution Trust Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring and Improvement
Act of 1991 (Refinancing Act), the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and Independent
Agencies Appropriations Act of 1992 (1992 Appropriations Act), the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992
(1992 Housing Act) and the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act of 1993 (Completion Act) changed the manner
in which the RTC is to identify, market and sell certain properties under the AHDP. This rule also clarifies certain
policies of the RTC regarding the disposition of assets in the AHDP and reflects certain comments received with respect
to a previously published interim final rule. By implementing the statutory changes required by the Refinancing
Act, the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992 Housing Act, and the Completion Act, and clarifying certain provisions
of the AHDP and making the other changes set forth herein, these regulations will enhance the availability and affordability
of residential real property for very-low income, lower-income and moderate-income families and individuals.

Regulatory Procedure
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On August 31, 1990 (55 FR 35564), the RTC published a final rule establishing the procedures to be followed by the RTC
in connection with the sale of eligible residential properties to qualifying purchasers under the AHDP. Those procedures
were established in accordance with the affordable housing provisions of section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Act, as amended be section 501 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA)
(12 U.S.C. 1441a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 6, 1992 (57 FR 19500), the RTC published an interim final rule and requested comments (May 6, 1992 Interim Rule).
That publication implemented some of the statutory changes made to the AHDP by the Refinancing Act and clarified the
RTC's policies on a number of issues relating to the disposition of assets in the AHDP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 12, 1992 (57 FR 24937), the RTC published an interim statement of policy titled Lower Income Occupancy Requirements
for Bulk Sales in the Multifamily Affordable Housing Disposition Program. That publication provided that when more
than one multifamily property is purchased from the RTC under the AHDP, the RTC will require that not less than 15 percent
of the dwelling units in each separate multifamily property purchased in bulk be made available to low or very-low
income individuals. The final statement of policy was published on August 19, 1992 (57 FR 37581) and reflected no changes
from the interim statement of policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On October 19, 1994, (59 FR 52669) the RTC published an interim Final Rule which implemented several statutory changes
made to the AHDP by the Refinancing Act and not reflected in the May 6, 1992 interim final rule, implemented a number
of statutory changes made to the AHDP by the enactment of the 1992 Appropriations Act, the 1992 Housing Act, and the
Completion Act, and, it further clarified RTC policies relating to the disposition of assets within the AHDP.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The RTC is making no changes to the interim final rule in the adoption of the final rule. The supplementary information
accompanying the interim final rule provides an explanation of 12 CFR part 1609 and the reasons for its adoption.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the following regulatory flexibility analysis is provided:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A succinct statement of the need for, and the objective of, the rule. The objective of the rule is to implement changes
made to the AHDP by enactment of the 1992 Appropriations Act, the Housing Act, and the Completion Act, which establishes
certain requirements for the RTC in the marketing and selling of real estate assets. The rule is needed in order to implement
the requirements of the cited statutes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A summary of the issues raised by public comments in response to the initial regulatory flexibility analysis, a
summary of the assessment by the agency of such issue, and a statement of any changes made in the interim final rule as
a result of such comments. The one public comment received by the RTC endorsed the regulations as drafted in the interim
final rule. No changes were made as a result of that comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A description of each of the significant alternatives to the rule consistent with the stated objectives of applicable
statutes and designed to minimize any significant economic impact of the rule on small entities which was considered
by the agency, and a statement of the reasons why each one of such alternatives was rejected. The rule has no significant
impact on small entities, and therefore, no alternatives to the rule were identified or considered.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Beech Model 400, 400A, 400T, and
MU&hyph;300&hyph;10 airplanes, and all Mitsubishi Model MU&hyph;300 airplanes. This action requires a revision
to the Airplane Flight Manual that provides pilots with special operating procedures during icing conditions. This
amendment is prompted by the results of icing tests, which demonstrated that ice accumulations on the horizontal
stabilizer may cause the airplane to pitch down at certain flaps settings. The actions specified in this AD are intended
to prevent uncommanded nose-down pitch at certain flap settings during icing conditions.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Recently, the FAA has received the results of icing tests conducted on the horizontal stabilizer of a Beech Model 400
airplane. These icing tests, conducted in an icing wind tunnel, demonstrated that, under certain icing conditions,
ice (called ``runback ice'') may accumulate on the horizontal stabilizer aft of the heated element on the leading
edge. This accumulated ice caused the test airplane to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pitch down at landing flaps set beyond 10 degrees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After further review and evaluation of the test data, Beech has developed landing performance data for Beech Model
MU&hyph;300&hyph;10 airplanes and Beech Model 400 series airplanes with flaps set at 10 degrees. These landing performance
data include landing distances, landing brake energy, and maximum landing weight. (The 10-degree landing flap performance
data for Mitsubishi Model MU&hyph;300 airplanes were included previously in that airplane's Airplane Flight Manual.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to those icing tests, the FAA received a report of tailplane icing that occurred during a maintenance flight
of a Beech Model 400A airplane. The airplane's tail anti-ice/de-ice systems were turned on during this flight, which
was only 15 minutes in duration, and the airplane did not go above 4,000 feet elevation. During this flight, when the
flaps were extended beyond 20 degrees, the pilot noted some buffet and ``stick walking,'' a pitch control effect in
which uncommanded oscillation of the control column 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
caused the airplane to pitch. The pilot was able to land the airplane without incident with the flaps set at 10 degrees.
Subsequent investigation revealed that the horizontal stabilizer had accumulations of triangularly-shaped runback
ice formations, which were approximately 2 inches in height. These runback ice formations were similar in size and
shape to those used in the icing tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such runback ice formations could result in an uncommanded nose-down pitch at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flap settings that exceed 10 degrees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the similarity in design of the horizontal stabilizers on Beech Model 400A airplanes and Mitsubishi Model MU&hyph;300
airplanes, and Beech Model 400, 400T, and MU&hyph;300&hyph;10 airplanes, the FAA has determined that all of these
airplanes may also be subject to the same unsafe condition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Beech Model 400, 400A, 400T,
and MU&hyph;300&hyph;10 airplanes and Mitsubishi Model MU&hyph;300 airplanes and of the same type design, this
AD is being issued to prevent uncommanded nose-down pitch at flap settings that exceed 10 degrees during icing conditions.
This AD requires a revision to the Limitations Section and Normal Procedures Section of the FAA-approved Airplane
Flight Manual (AFM), that provides pilots with special operating procedures during icing conditions. The landing
performance data developed as a result of the icing tests may be used under certain conditions for Beech Model MU&hyph;300&hyph;10
airplanes and Model 400 series airplanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity
for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective
in less than 30 days. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments Invited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was
not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons
are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under
the caption 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended
in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely
helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would
be needed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted
will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested
persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in
the Rules Docket. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement
is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
94&hyph;NM&hyph;204&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket.

 Section 2002(a) of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) required that the Secretary
of Transportation either designate six key areas as priority highway safety programs or submit a report to Congress
describing the reasons for not establishing these programs as priorities. Four of the six program areas had already
been designated as priority programs by the Secretary. This final rule adds Speed Control, but not School Bus Safety,
to the list of priority programs.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State and Community Highway Safety Grant Program (section 402 program) was established under the Highway Safety
Act of 1966, 23 U.S.C. 402. The Act required the establishment of Uniform Standards for State Highway Safety Programs
to assist the States and local communities in organizing their highway safety programs. Eighteen such standards
were established and have been administered at the Federal level by FHWA and NHTSA. NHTSA is responsible for developing
and implementing highway safety programs relating to the vehicle and driver; FHWA has similar responsibilities
in program areas involving the roadway. The FHWA is also responsible for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing programs relating to commercial motor vehicle safety. These programs include measures related to
speed control. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Until 1976, the 402 program was principally directed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
towards achieving State and local compliance with the 18 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Highway Safety Program Standards, which were considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mandatory requirements with financial sanctions for non-compliance. Under the Highway Safety Act of 1976, Congress
provided for a more flexible implementation of the program so the Secretary would not have to require State compliance
with every uniform standard or with each element of every uniform standard. As a result, the standards became more
like guidelines for use by the States, and management of the program shifted from enforcing standards to one of problem
identification and countermeasure development and evaluation, using the standards as a framework for the State
programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1981, Congress passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97&hyph;35, revising the section
402 program. The Act directed the agencies to conduct rulemaking to determine those State and local highway safety
programs most effective in reducing accidents, injuries, and fatalities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 1, 1982, NHTSA and FHWA issued a joint final rule (47 FR 15116) identifying six National Priority program areas
which the agencies then considered to be the most effective highway safety programs. The six program areas included
one FHWA program area, Safety Construction and Operational Improvements, and the following NHTSA Program Areas:
Occupant Protection, Alcohol Countermeasures, Police Traffic Services, Emergency Medical Services, and Traffic
Records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The April 1982 final rule provided that these National Priority program areas would be eligible for Federal funding
using an expedited procedure under the 402 program. 23 CFR 1205.4. It also established a mechanism by which other,
nonpriority programs identified by a State may be eligible for Federal funding. 23 CFR 1205.5(a) and (b).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 2, 1987, the enactment of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987 (Public
Law 100&hyph;17) revised 23 U.S.C. 402. The changes provided for a periodic review of the effectiveness of the various
programs eligible for funding under section 402 in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. The periodic review
procedure was enacted to ensure the continued relevance of the section 402 program to changing circumstances and
traffic safety needs and to ensure that Federal funds continue to be used for the most effective programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The legislation also provided that the standards promulgated under section 402 and codified in 23 CFR Part 1204 be
changed to guidelines. The purpose of this amendment was to conform the language of section 402 and Part 1204 to the
current implementation of the programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to these amendments, NHTSA and FHWA conducted a rulemaking action to review those programs most effective
in reducing crashes, injuries and fatalities. In a final rule issued on April 6, 1988 (53 FR 1255), the agencies determined
that the National Priority program areas should continue to include the one FHWA program area, Roadway Safety (formerly,
Safety Construction and Operational Improvements), and the five NHTSA program areas that had been identified in
1982. In addition, the agencies determined that a sixth NHTSA area, Motorcycle Safety, should be added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 3, 1991, NHTSA and FHWA published a joint NPRM (56 FR 20387) proposing to add Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety as
one of the National Priority program areas. The public comments supported that proposal and the area of Pedestrian
and Bicycle Safety was added to the list of National Priority program areas eligible for the expedited funding process
on October 4, 1991 (56 FR 50250). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these rulemaking actions, the National Priority program areas included the following:

The Secretary had already designated four of these six program areas as priority programs, but not Speed Control or
School Bus Safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, on January 14, 1994, NHTSA and FHWA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 requesting comments from the public on whether to expand the list of National Priority program areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies explained that they apply three criteria to determine whether a program area should be identified as
a National Priority program under 23 CFR Part 1205: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether the problem is of national concern (including the relative magnitude of the problem); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether effective countermeasures have been developed in this area which address this concern; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Whether State programs in the area appear to be among the most effective in reducing crashes, injuries, and
fatalities as compared to other traffic safety program areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM proposed to expand the list of National Priority program areas to include Speed Control, and requested comments
on the agencies' preliminary determination that School Bus Safety should not be added as a National Priority program
area at this time.

Comments Received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies received 34 comments to the docket in response to the NPRM, including comments from 22 State agencies
(with responsibility for transportation/highway safety, law enforcement and education); a local PTA Council;
a county health department; a private bus operator; and nine national organizations. The national organizations
represent highway safety interests (National Association of Governors' Highway Safety Representatives, Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety and the Center for Auto Safety); law enforcement
organizations (International Association of Chiefs of Police and National Sheriffs' Association); and pupil transportation
interests (National Association for Pupil Transportation, National Association of State Directors of Pupil Transportation
Services and National School Transportation Association). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on our review of the comments received and other available information, NHTSA and FHWA have decided to adopt
the proposal published in the NPRM. For the reasons set forth below, the agencies have decided to add Speed Control
to the list of National Priority program areas, and not to add School Bus Safety to the list at this time.

Is Speeding a Problem of National Concern? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA and FHWA tentatively concluded in the NPRM that speeding is a problem of national concern, based on a number of
considerations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies explained in the NPRM that speeding is defined as not only exceeding the posted speed limit, but also driving
too fast for conditions. While the agencies recognized that reliable data on travel speeds are relatively limited
and often difficult to compare, NHTSA and FHWA tentatively concluded in the NPRM, based on the most reliable data available,
that the travel speeds of motorists have increased in recent years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM explained that NHTSA studies suggest that most drivers recognize that speeding is a violation of the law,
but few regard the violation as a serious offense. This led the agency to conclude that the public does not view speeding
per se as an immediate safety risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as NHTSA and FHWA pointed out in the NPRM, speeding is one of the most prevalent reported factors associated
with crashes, and studies identify correlations between speeding and other factors often associated with crashes,
including alcohol involvement, young drivers, male drivers, motorcyclists and nighttime driving. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies reported in the NPRM that speeding is cited as a contributing factor in approximately 11 percent of all
police-reported crashes and in approximately 34 percent of all fatal crashes (NHTSA, Fatal Accident Reporting System,
1991). The agencies estimated that in 1991, 13,909 fatalities and 77,000 moderate to critical injuries occurred
in speed-related crashes, resulting in an economic cost for all speed-related crashes (including all injury levels)
of over $19 billion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained in the NPRM, excessive speed contributes to motor vehicle crashes in a number of ways. Drivers have less
time to react when travelling at higher speeds since speed increases the distance a vehicle travels during the time
it takes for a driver to react to a perceived danger; speed increases the total stopping distance necessary to halt
a vehicle; and speed reduces a driver's ability to steer safely around curves on highways or objects in the roadway.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Speed variance, the difference in speed among vehicles in the traffic stream, also contributes to motor vehicle crashes.
As speed variance increases, vehicles come close to each other more frequently, which leads to more frequent lane
changes and passing maneuvers as the faster drivers seek to avoid slower-moving vehicles. Research studies have
shown that motor vehicle crashes are more likely where speed variance is greater, and data have shown that a speed variance
of 20 mph from the average speed can result in a crash risk 11 times greater than those travelling at the average speed.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, increased speeds result in reduced margins for error and increased severity for those vehicles involved
in crashes. As the speed of a car increases from 20 mph to 80 mph, a factor of four, the energy of the impact delivered in
a collision with a fixed object goes up by a factor of sixteen, increasing dramatically the chance of death or serious
injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Citing a recent FHWA study entitled Assessment of Current Speed Zoning Criteria, the NPRM indicated that: (1) On average,
seven out of ten motorists exceeded posted limits; (2) average speeds ran approximately two to six mph above posted
limits; and (3) prevailing 85th percentile speeds ran approximately eight to twelve mph above posted limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, the West Virginia Division of Highways, questioned the agencies' tentative conclusion that speeding
is a problem of national concern. The State asserted that the agencies' comparison between the 85th percentile speed
and the speed limit indicates a problem with speed zones (which, according to West Virginia, are set through public
pressure rather than by engineering principles), not with speeding. West Virginia further suggested that, as drivers
have gained additional experience driving faster than 55 (following the speed limit's being raised to 65 on certain
rural Interstates), ``it is to be anticipated that speeds would gradually increase.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies accept West Virginia's explanation that, as drivers gain additional experience driving faster, their
speeds tend to increase. We disagree, however, that this supports a conclusion that the difference between the 85th
percentile speed and the speed limit indicates a problem with speed zones, not with speeding. In fact, if West Virginia's
explanation is correct, the agencies believe that, if speed limits were increased to match the 85th percentile, speeds
are likely to gradually increase even further, as drivers adjust to the higher speed limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other comments received in response to the NPRM supported the agencies' conclusion that speeding is a problem
of national concern. New Mexico, for example, reported that it continues to suffer among the highest rates of motor
vehicle deaths in the nation, and some 25% of their crash fatalities involve excessive speed. Michigan reported that
in 1991 excessive speed accounted for 43% of the total crashes, 44% of fatal crashes, 52% of injury crashes and 41% of
property damage crashes in that State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alaska commented that traveling at unsafe speeds is the leading cause of the State's motor vehicle crashes and is a
contributing factor in 27% of its fatal crashes. North Carolina stated that in 1992 speed was noted as a contributing
factor in 32% of all crashes and 39.8% of fatal crashes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) provided data supporting the agencies' conclusion that travel
speeds are increasing. In addition, IIHS stated that fatalities have increased along with travel speeds. According
to IIHS:

In the 40 States that increased their speed limits to 65 mph on rural interstates during 1987 and 1988, deaths on these
roads were 17 percent higher in 1992, compared with the average number of deaths on the same roads during 1982&hyph;86.
In contrast, deaths on rural interstates where the 55 mph limit was retained were 28 percent lower in 1992 compared
with 1982&hyph;86. In the 40 States that raised their rural interstate speed limit, the urban interstate limit speed
remained unchanged and on those highways, deaths in 1992 were 8 percent lower than in 1982&hyph;86 (IIHS, 1993b).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Have Effective Speed Control Countermeasures Been Developed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies identified, in the NPRM, a number of speed control countermeasures that they consider to be effective.
They indicated that NHTSA has identified and evaluated, and is currently demonstrating in the law enforcement community
a number of new law enforcement technologies to further advance speed control efforts, including radar, VASCAR,
laser speed measuring devices, aerial speed measurement, photo radar and electronic signing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPRM stated that NHTSA studies show that one of the best methods for obtaining compliance with speed limits is to
combine an aggressive enforcement campaign with a vigorous public information and education effort. It also cited
other effective countermeasures, such as saturation patrols and multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional enforcement
efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the areas of highway design and traffic control, the agencies explained that freeway design, culminating in the
Interstate System, has eliminated at-grade intersections and provided for free flow traffic, which has resulted
in a significant reduction in speed variance and the promotion of uniform operating speed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other effective countermeasures were also mentioned. For example, the NPRM indicated that variable message speed
signs have been developed to control speed for varying conditions and that real time regulatory variable speed limits
are now being tested in the State of Washington. The NPRM indicated that these efforts can be further enhanced through
the development of comprehensive speed control programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters cited many of the same countermeasures and technologies in their responses to the NPRM, and indicated
they considered them to be effective. IIHS, for example, indicated it believes VASCAR and laser technologies can
be effective at increasing the proportion of speeders cited for violations since they are not detectable by radar
detectors. IIHS recommended also the use of radar detector detectors (RDDs) as an effective countermeasure for identifying
individuals who are likely to be ``professional speeders.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No commenters suggested that no effective speed control countermeasures have been developed, and the agencies continue
to conclude that effective countermeasures have been developed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Do State Speed Control Programs Appear To Be Among the Most Effective in Reducing Crashes, Injuries, and Fatalities?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA and FHWA stated in the NPRM that state programs that have been conducted to date demonstrate that speed control
countermeasures are extremely effective in reducing deaths and injuries, and cited a number of examples. (For details,
interested persons should read the NPRM.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) interpreted this statement to mean that the agencies were placing more
importance on State, rather than local, programs. NHTSA and FHWA did not intend to give this impression. In fact, the
agencies recognize that many countermeasures in the Speed Control area can be carried out most effectively at the
local level. The agencies' reference to ``State programs'' was intended to cover programs conducted at either the
State or local level within a State. California OTS went on to indicate that many countermeasures have been employed
successfully throughout the State to address the speeding problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of California Highway Patrol (CHP) stated that effective countermeasures exist only for localized
speed control. CHP claimed that the success of these programs is almost always localized and/or temporary. The agencies
agree that localized enforcement efforts alone generally result in only localized, short-term impacts. However,
it has long been established that enforcement efforts, when combined with a vigorous public information and education
campaign, have much more long-lasting effects. (See, ``Evaluation of the New York State Police 55 MPH Speed Enforcement
Project,'' August 1969, by the Institute for Traffic Safety Management and Research.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters, such as IIHS and Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, supported this view. Advocates further commented,
``A national effort [which provides a greater level of public information and awareness regarding the safety dangers
associated with speeding] will establish the safety context for state and local speed control efforts under the 402
Program and provide those efforts with added credibility.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
West Virginia questioned the validity of the examples cited in the NPRM. The State argued that ``the reductions in
speed [experienced in South Carolina and St. Louis] were minuscule'' and ``the sample [used in California] was very
small.'' West Virginia continued, ``the Notice states a belief that the programs were effective but it gives no measures
of statistical significance or indications of necessary seasonal adjustments or other information to back up this
conclusion.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies disagree with West Virginia's comments. The success of the South Carolina study, for example, was not
measured by reductions in speed, but rather using other factors. As stated in the NPRM, there were 12,472 fewer crashes
(a 10% decrease), 2,331 fewer injuries (a 7% decrease) and 106 fewer fatalities in 1991 in South Carolina as compared
to 1989 (an 11% decrease). The vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in South Carolina increased from 32,780 million to 34,456
million (a 5% increase) during this period of time. The agencies believe the State's rural initiative contributed
to these reductions and that these reductions are significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies agree that the reduction in average speed (from 62 mph to 61 mph) experienced in the first year of the St.
Louis enforcement operation (Operation Gateway) was not a significant reduction. However, the NPRM stated that
the St. Louis program was continuing and was expected to result in further speed decreases, and further results have
in fact been achieved. The Missouri Division of Highway Safety did not report the reduction in average speed as part
of the second phase of Operation Gateway. The State did report, however, that, prior to the kickoff of the operation,
the average speed of vehicles stopped for speeding on I&hyph;270 was 78.3 mph, and the average speed of vehicles stopped
during the Operation Gateway kickoff was 74.3 mph. This represents a 5% reduction in speed. The agencies believe this
reduction is significant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With regard to the California study, the sample used may have appeared small, as compared with the general motor vehicle
population, but the study's focus was on commercial motor vehicles, and the study used as its sample a census of all
crashes where the commercial motor vehicle was at fault. As the agencies explained in the NPRM, speed control efforts
targeted commercial motor vehicles, and the data revealed that the number of crashes where commercial motor vehicles
were at fault decreased by 3.5% (from 810 in 1986 to 782 in 1987). The number of crashes caused by commercial motor vehicles
which resulted in injuries also declined, by 11.2% (from 259 in 1986 to 230 in 1987).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Seasonal adjustments were not made for the studies referenced in the NPRM because they were not considered to be necessary.
Seasonal adjustments are not considered to be necessary, for example, for studies in which data is to be collected
during a brief period of time involving no seasonal changes or for studies in which data is to be collected during comparable
time periods. Data was collected for the South Carolina study during the same four months in 1990 and 1991. Data was
collected for the St. Louis effort during a brief period of time before and during the kickoff of Operation Gateway,
so seasonal changes were not a factor in that study. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the commenters agreed with the conclusion in the NPRM that Speed Control Programs appear to be among the most
effective in reducing crashes, injuries, and fatalities, and they provided examples demonstrating the effectiveness
of speed control countermeasures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
IIHS indicated that, in South Carolina, police issued 41 tickets per 1,000 vehicles using lasers, as compared with
33 per 1,000 using conventional radar. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New York State reported that it experienced the lowest fatality rate on record in 1992 (1.65 deaths per hundred million
vehicle miles traveled), ``due in large part to the Division's strict [comprehensive speed] enforcement program.''
According to New York, the fatality rate of 1.65 was 29 percent lower than 2.33 in 1987 (when the State started its program)
and equates to 520 fewer lives lost on the highways of that State. The program included a saturation strategy that not
only led to the apprehension of specific motorists, but also established a visible presence and generated publicity
which raised the perception of risk among all motorists within the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on available information and the comments received in response to the NPRM, the agencies continue to conclude
that Speed Control Programs are among the most effective in reducing crashes, injuries, and fatalities.

Other Comments Received About Speed Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State of Illinois agreed that Speed Control should be designated a priority program, but commented that there
should be no earmarking of funds for Speed Control (or any other program) and monetary sanctions should not be imposed
on States for failing to meet compliance levels. Congress enacted the National Maximum Speed Limit law, which established
monetary sanctions for noncompliance and has, from time to time, imposed earmarking or set-aside requirements in
appropriations legislation. NHTSA and FHWA are bound to implement these congressional requirements. However,
the designation of Speed Control as a priority program under section 402 in this final rule will not create any additional
earmarking requirements or monetary sanctions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most comments strongly supported the designation of Speed Control as a National Priority program area, particularly
at this time. New Mexico, for example, expressed its view that:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Speeding and excessive highway speeds have reached epidemic proportions and must be treated as a national public
health problem. *&blank;*&blank;* It is incumbent on the agencies to develop a high profile national program against
speeding that provides a greater level of public information and awareness regarding the safety dangers associated
with speeding.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NAGHSR concurred with the designation of Speed Control as a National Priority, but expressed concern about the ``proliferation
of 402 priorities'' and the ``possible overlap and duplication'' between the Speed Control and Police Traffic Services
(PTS) programs. NAGHSR suggested that the agencies consider instead combining these two programs in a way that emphasizes
the importance of speed compliance activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three other commenters also recommended that Speed Control be included under PTS, but for different reasons. California
OTS expressed concern that a separate Speed Control program area could ``result in the redirection of efforts into
`speed only' projects and dilute the accomplishments made in highlighting speed as a major problem in all traffic
safety ventures.'' CHP stated that Speed Control already receives considerable attention, and argued that including
Speed Control under PTS would allow individual States to better balance their overall approach to traffic safety.
West Virginia expressed its opinion that ``public acceptance is likely to be higher if the Speed Control function
is part of a well-reasoned and balanced enforcement program rather than as a stand-alone effort which can be interpreted
as a revenue enhancement measure.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies agree with the commenters that Speed Control programs should continue to be included as part of broader
traffic safety programs. However, the designation of Speed Control as a priority program does not require that States
establish ``stand-alone'' efforts. States have the ability and, in fact, are encouraged by the agencies to continue
to include Speed Control messages in their other traffic safety programs. It is the agencies' hope that the program's
designation as a National Priority program area will result in the inclusion of Speed Control messages in more traffic
safety programs than before. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA and FHWA have considered the comments cited above, and decided not to include Speed Control as part of PTS. The
agencies recognize that there will be some overlap between the areas of Speed Control and PTS, since law enforcement
activity is an important component in any Speed Control program. (There is a similar level of overlap between the areas
of PTS and other priority programs, such as Alcohol Countermeasures and Occupant Protection, to the extent that police
agencies enforce laws designed to address these issues.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the agencies believe it is important to list the Speed Control program (as well as Alcohol Countermeasures
and Occupant Protection) separately, to reflect non-law enforcement activities that are equally important components
of these programs. In the area of Speed Control, these components include, for example, the development and enactment
of speed-related laws, the use of new technologies, public information and education activities, and the reexamination
of speed zoning criteria to ensure that posted speed limits are appropriate for conditions.

Speed Control Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agencies conclude that speeding does represent a significant traffic safety problem throughout the country,
and that numerous countermeasures have been developed that have proven to be most effective in addressing this problem.
Accordingly, NHTSA and FHWA have decided to designate Speed Control as a separate National Priority program area.
Speed Control will be administered jointly by both agencies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Is School Bus Safety a Problem of National Concern? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA and FHWA explained in the NPRM that the safety of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
children in school buses has been a primary concern of parents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and school systems ever since buses began to be used to transport children and that this concern has helped develop
school buses into the safest form of transportation in the country. The NPRM reported that, according to the National
Safety Council's ``Accident Facts'' (1991), during the 1989&hyph;90 school year, an estimated 380,000 buses were
used to transport 22 million pupils approximately 3.8 billion miles (21 million miles per school day) and that occupant
fatality rates per hundred million passenger miles in 1989 were 1.12 for passenger cars and 0.04 for school buses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies recognized in the NPRM that school bus crashes, as compared with automobile crashes, have a much different
effect on the population as a whole. When a child is fatally injured in a school bus crash, there is a greater sense of
loss and a greater sense of tragedy. For this reason, school bus fatalities and crashes often receive a high degree
of public attention and draw an immediate and passionate response from the community.

However, the number of fatalities in school bus crashes is small, particularly when considering exposure and when
compared to the number of fatalities related to other priority programs. In 1991, passenger cars were involved in
86.4 percent of all traffic crashes and 67.9 percent of all fatal crashes; whereas school buses were involved in only
0.4 percent of all traffic crashes and in 0.3 percent of all fatal crashes. These data demonstrate that the safety problem
related to school buses is not great when compared to that of other types of vehicles.

Based on these findings, NHTSA and FHWA tentatively concluded in the NPRM that School Bus Safety is not a problem that
merits designation as a National Priority program area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters argued that any number of school bus fatalities above zero is too high a fatality rate and, therefore,
justifies designating School Bus Safety as a Priority program. According to the California Department of Education,
``school bus safety must be a priority issue for both the State and Federal Government for as long as our accident statistics
show one `1' pupil passenger or one `1' pupil pedestrian fatality. Zero `0', tolerance of pupil passenger and pedestrian
fatalities must be our goal.'' Similarly, the Center for Auto Safety argued that ``the only way DOT could reject school
bus safety as a Priority Program would be to find that such a designation would not reduce injuries and deaths in school
buses at all.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies disagree, and while other commenters sought to have the agencies designate School Bus Safety as a priority
program area, they did not suggest that School Bus Safety represents a significant national problem. In fact, the
Superintendent of Public Instruction for Washington State said, ``We cannot disagree with [the statistics] you
have published [and w]e can not provide any additional statistics that disagree with what you have already stated
regarding Pupil Transportation as the safest means of travel in the highway safety system.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most commenters fully agreed with the agencies' conclusion that School Bus Safety does not represent a serious problem
when compared to safety in other types of vehicles. The Oregon Department of Transportation, for example, stated
``Oregon has had one serious school bus accident in the last seventeen years. And, even though safety of our children
is a major concern, I do not believe school busses should be a NHTSA priority. *&blank;*&blank;* School busses are
probably the safest place for students to be. We do not need to concentrate extraordinary effort on school bus safety.''
The North Carolina Department of Transportation commented, ``In North Carolina, as in the rest of the nation, school
buses remain the safest mode of transportation. *&blank;*&blank;* While the safety of our children is still paramount,
it will be extremely difficult for any further school bus safety initiatives to be cost effective.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
New Mexico provided data which supported the agencies' conclusion. The State's comments indicated, ``95 percent
of school children in serious crashes during school hours were in conventional passenger vehicles_passenger cars,
pickups, and vans.'' Only one percent of New Mexico's school children in serious crashes during school hours were
in buses. The remaining 4 percent were pedestrians, on motorcycles, on pedalcycles, and others, at one percent each.
New Mexico's comments continued, ``It is fair to say that non-use of safety belts in private vehicles is the largest
part of New Mexico's schoolchild safety problem. *&blank;*&blank;* Indeed, the only deaths involving school buses
in the past decade have occurred outside the bus, or while entering or leaving.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments received and the information available to the agencies, NHTSA and FHWA continue to find that
School Bus Safety does not represent a serious problem that warrants its designation as a National Priority program
area.

Have Effective School Bus Safety Measures Been Developed? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA and FHWA explained in the NPRM that, although statistics demonstrate that school buses already provide a remarkably
safe form of transportation, steps have been taken to further improve School Bus Safety. These steps included providing
set-aside funds in 1990 and 1991 to assist States in implementing ``effective'' and ``most effective'' school bus
safety measures and publishing a number of rulemaking actions, such as a final rule requiring new school buses to be
equipped with a stop signal arm, a final rule revising the minimum requirements for school bus emergency exits and
improving access to school bus emergency doors and a final rule requiring that school buses enable drivers to see either
directly or through mirrors certain specified areas in front of and along both sides of the vehicle. For a full discussion
of these and other actions, interested individuals are encouraged to read the NPRM (59 FR 2341&hyph;42). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has taken a number of additional steps that were not listed in the NPRM to improve School Bus Safety. For example,
to improve the lateral stability and control of medium and heavy vehicles (including school buses) during braking,
NHTSA issued an NPRM proposing to require that these vehicles be equipped with an antilock brake system (58 F.R. 50738).
NHTSA also published a School Bus Safety Report and an annual publication entitled ``Traffic Safety Facts 1993_School
Buses.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the National Safety Council (NSC) has agreed to undertake a comprehensive marketing campaign on a school
bus/pedestrian safety educational program, developed recently by NHTSA for children in grades K&hyph;6. This program
is currently being modified into a product that will be more marketable. NSC anticipates reaching over seven million
people in its initial marketing effort. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has also taken steps to improve communications with the Pupil Transportation community. The Department issued
a press release concerning school bus safety in August 1994, just prior to the beginning of the new school year and,
on August 18, 1994, NHTSA conducted a National Meeting on Transporting Pre-Kindergarten Children on School Buses.
The meeting brought together, for the first time, school bus manufacturers, child safety seat manufacturers, pupil
transportation officials, child safety seat trainers, injury control professionals and Federal officials to discuss
this emerging transportation issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA and FHWA will continue to engage in appropriate activities that improve the safety of school buses.

Do State School Bus Safety Measures Appear To Be Among the Most Effective in Reducing Crashes, Injuries, and Fatalities?

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated previously, school buses already provide the safest form of transportation in our country. Since the number
of fatalities that are school bus-related is already so small, it is difficult to quantify the benefits of the actions
that have been taken. The agencies believe, however, that these actions (described above), are the ones most likely
to reduce or eliminate fatal and serious injuries.

Fourteen commenters supported the agencies' tentative conclusion not to designate School Bus Safety as a National
Priority program area. These commenters included three national highway safety organizations, ten State highway
safety/transportation agencies and one State highway patrol. Twelve commenters urged the agencies to reconsider
their tentative conclusion. These commenters included one national highway safety organization, one national
police organization, three national pupil transportation organizations, five State departments of education,
one local PTA council and one private bus operator.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters supported the designation of School Bus Safety as a National Priority program area based on specific
safety concerns they face. Three commenters, for example, expressed concern over recent increases in the number
of incidents involving misbehavior and violence on school buses, and one commenter expressed concern about crashes
involving buses and heavy trucks. While these problems may be of concern in particular communities, the comments
did not reveal and our data do not indicate that these are problems of great magnitude throughout the nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section 402 program provides States with a mechanism for funding programs that address State or local concerns,
by providing justification that includes information on the identified problem and the activities or projects that
are planned. Accordingly, these States and communities have the ability, if they so choose and can provide the justification,
to develop programs to address the problems identified in their comments. Moreover, the existence of these local
problems does not support a decision to designate School Bus Safety as a National Priority program area for the entire
nation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of commenters supported the agencies' view. The Massachusetts Governor's Highway Safety Bureau, for example,
stated, ``School bus safety deserves a place within the 402 program, however each state should identify the need for
funding, within the framework of the existing 402 guidelines.'' The Michigan Department of State Police commented,
``[school bus safety] is an important element of any state's highway safety program but should be based upon the identified
need in a particular state.'' The Arizona Governor's Office of Highway Safety reported that it was able to support
a school bus driver/instructor training and certification program using section 402 dollars using the current funding
procedures. Arizona commented, ``There was no program priority for school bus safety at that time, and we were still
able to address the issue by utilizing the current U.S. Department of Transportation 402 program management procedures
already in place.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments of the National Association of Governors' Highway Safety Representatives (NAGHSR) were most comprehensive,
and represented the views expressed by many of the other commenters. NAGHSR stated: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
We *&blank;*&blank;* concur that school bus safety should not be designated a National Program Priority. NAGHSR
is very supportive of the need for protecting the safety of school children. However, state crash statistics indicate
that the problem is not of sufficient magnitude to warrant a priority designation. Furthermore, we are concerned
that the designation of school bus safety will divert scarce 402 resources away from critical highway safety areas
such as impaired driving, occupant protection, and speed control. States currently have the flexibility to spend
402 funds on school bus safety if the needs exist and can be documented. This flexibility is sufficient to address whatever
school bus safety needs may exist. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commenters that urged the agencies to designate School Bus Safety as a National Priority program area did so not
based on a perceived current safety problem or concern, but rather based on a need for continued funding to maintain
their positive safety record. As explained previously, however, this is not a valid criterion for designating a program
to be a National Priority area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies are not attempting, as suggested by the National School Transportation Association, to ``[p]enaliz[e]
the industry for doing a good job.'' In fact, we applaud the industry for its dedication and continued excellent record
of service and safety. Rather, we are simply making our best efforts to ensure that scarce 402 resources are used where
they can have the greatest positive effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most of the commenters agreed with this approach. The North Carolina Department of Transportation, for example,
stated, ``By not including school bus safety as a priority program NHTSA and FHWA will allow limited resources to be
utilized where they can be most effective.'' New Mexico commented that it supports the agencies' decision to ``leav[e]
school bus safety in its current status as an important area of state efforts to protect children, but without elevating
it to a higher status as a national priority program area.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies understand the concern of many of the commenters who are fearful that funds currently available may be
discontinued. The agencies do not intend for the decision not to include School Bus Safety as a National Priority program
to create an implication that resources currently devoted to School Bus Safety should be reduced or redirected.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters noted that many more school children die or are injured as pedestrians or bicyclists than as
school bus occupants. The National School Transportation Association stated, ``Outside the bus, in the loading/unloading
zone area, has been and is still the problem area.'' According to NHTSA's ``Traffic Safety Facts 1993_School Buses,''
of the people who lost their lives in school bus-related crashes from 1983 through 1993, 59 percent were occupants
of other vehicles involved in the crash, 30 percent were non-occupants (pedestrians, bicyclists, etc.) and only
11 percent were occupants of school buses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some of these commenters were hopeful that problems related to the loading and unloading of school children can be
addressed through the Pedestrian Safety program area, which was designated a National Priority area in 1991. Within
this context, some commenters requested additional emphasis and attention from the agencies with regard to pedestrian
safety issues, and the Superintendent of Public Instruction in Washington State cautioned that ``the emphasis of
[pedestrian safety programs] usually has little to do with school bus stops.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has already taken steps to address this concern, which is shared by the agencies. In September 1992, NHTSA started
a research and development effort relating to elementary school-age pedestrians who are school bus riders. Under
this effort, which was completed in the spring of 1994, the agency reviewed existing training materials and national
crash data relating to school bus pedestrian safety for elementary school-age children; developed a school bus/pedestrian
safety educational program for children in grades K&hyph;6, which includes teacher's guides, a poster and a video
for grades K&hyph;3, videos and brochures for parents and bus drivers, and promotional materials; selected a school
district to assess the program's effectiveness in reducing crash-related behaviors; implemented and evaluated
the program in that district and modified the program, as warranted. A report regarding this effort is expected to
be published in the spring of 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated earlier, the National Safety Council (NSC) has agreed to undertake a comprehensive marketing campaign
on the school bus/pedestrian safety educational program. This program is currently being modified into a product
that will be more marketable. NSC anticipates reaching over seven million people in its initial marketing effort.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Center for Auto Safety (CAS) objected to the agencies' decision by arguing that Congress ``mandated'' in ISTEA
that School Bus Safety must be a priority program. CAS asserted that, since Congress was aware when it enacted ISTEA
that there were lower fatality rates for school buses, ``The only way for DOT to overturn the Congressional mandate
in ISTEA that school bus safety shall be a Priority Program is for DOT to find that a Priority Program cannot reduce deaths
and injuries in school bus accidents.'' According to CAS, ``DOT cannot substitute its judgment for that of Congress
which has determined that saving even a few lives from school bus accidents is as important a priority as saving thousands
of lives lost due to excess speeds.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies strongly disagree with CAS' comments. We have no reason to believe, and CAS cites no basis for its assertions,
that Congress mandated that School Bus Safety must be designated a priority program if the program has the potential
to save just a single life or that Congress believes that the thousands of lives lost due to excess speeds (many of whom
are children) are somehow less important than the few children whose lives are lost in school buses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In fact, the legislative history shows quite the contrary. The House version of ISTEA identified eight required and
seven optional highway safety programs. Speeding was identified in the House legislation as a required program;
school bus safety was identified as an optional program. (The Senate version of ISTEA had no comparable provision.)
The final ISTEA legislation, which was developed in conference, listed just six program areas and eliminated the
separate categories. However, it specifically provided the agencies with the option of choosing not to designate
one or more of these six programs as National Priorities by reporting to Congress the reasons for not establishing
the programs as priority areas. (CAS acknowledged this option in its comments.) Moreover, there is no suggestion
anywhere in the legislative history that School Bus Safety (or any of the highway safety programs, for that matter)
should meet criteria other than those normally applied by the agencies when they determine what programs should be
designated as National Priority areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CAS also questioned the agencies' reliance on data from FARS, ``Accident Facts'' and the National Safety Council.
CAS argued that the agencies should not rely on these data because they under-report school crashes, deaths and injuries.
Another commenter, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, also pointed out that school bus crashes, injuries and
fatalities may be under-reported, and suggested that the agencies investigate this issue. This commenter, however,
fully supported the agencies' preliminary conclusions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies acknowledge that there may be some under-reporting of school bus crashes, deaths and injuries, and we
are taking steps to improve these data. Currently, pursuant to section 2002(a) of ISTEA, the Department is in the process
of developing minimum reporting criteria for States regarding deaths and injuries resulting from school bus crashes,
as well as deaths and injuries involving other circumstances. While it may be possible to improve the data, it is clear
from the data currently available (including those contained in comments received in response to the NPRM) that the
numbers of school bus crashes, injuries and fatalities are extremely low.

School Bus Safety Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The safety of children in school buses is an important concern, since any crash, particularly one resulting in fatalities
or serious injury to children, is so tragic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the number of crashes, injuries and fatalities involving school buses is small, particularly when considering
exposure and when compared to the number of crashes, injuries and fatalities related to other priority programs.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agencies believe significant attention has been devoted to School Bus Safety and steps have been taken to improve
the already excellent safety record of this mode of transportation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the states already have the ability under the Section 402 program to address school bus and other highway
safety programs, and are proficient in allocating existing resources as they deem necessary to achieve maximum safety
benefits. In addition, the States are able to address the majority of school bus-related fatalities, which occur
while children are boarding or exiting, not riding the bus, under the Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety program, which
is a designated National Priority area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, and based on a review of the comments and other information currently available, the agencies conclude
that there is not sufficient justification for designating School Bus Safety as a National Priority program area.

Therefore, the agencies have not included School Bus Safety as a National Priority program at this time. The agencies
wish to stress that this decision should not be construed to imply that the current resources focused upon School Bus
Safety should be reduced or redirected. NHTSA and FHWA believe that all existing efforts in this area should be continued
to maintain the impressive safety record associated with school bus transportation.

Other Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, a local health department in Reno, Nevada, urged the agencies to reinstate Emergency Medical Services
(EMS) as a priority program under section 402. As mentioned earlier in this notice, EMS was designated as a priority
program on April 1, 1982. It has not been removed from the list of priorities. In fact, every program that has been designated
by the agencies as a priority program remains on the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained above, ISTEA required that the Secretary of Transportation either designate six program areas as priority
highway safety programs or submit a report to Congress describing the reasons for not establishing these programs
as priorities. Four of the programs that NHTSA and FHWA had previously designated as priority areas (Traffic Records,
Emergency Medical Services, Pedestrian and Bicycle Safety and Roadway Safety) were not listed in ISTEA. ISTEA continued
to provide the agencies with authority, however, to include additional programs or maintain existing programs on
the list of priority areas. Accordingly, these four programs continue to be included on the list of National Priority
program areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Sheriffs' Association recommended that the following be considered priority programs: (1) Speed Control;
(2) Occupant Protection/Child Safety Protection; (3) DWI/DUI Detection and Standardized Field Sobriety Programs
for law enforcement officers/deputies; (4) Conspicuity Markings at Railway/Railroad/Mass Transit Crossings
and (5) Drug Evaluation, Classification, Drug Recognition Expert (DRE), and the Drug Recognition Technician (DRT)
Programs for law enforcement officers/deputies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained above, this final rule designates Speed Control as a National Priority program area. Occupant Protection
has been a National Priority area since 1982. It includes activities designed to protect occupants who are children.
Alcohol and Other Drug Countermeasures has also been a National Priority since 1982. States and communities may conduct
DWI/DUI Detection, Standardized Field Sobriety, Drug Evaluation and Classification (DEC), Drug Recognition Expert
(DRE), and Drug Recognition Technician (DRT) Programs for law enforcement officers/deputies under this program
area. The agencies do not see a need to emphasize these programs as separate priorities. Finally, States and communities
can conduct certain activities to improve the conspicuity of markings at railway, railroad and mass transit crossings
under Roadway Safety, a FHWA National Priority program. In addition, there are other sources of Federal assistance
available from FHWA to improve safety in this area. FHWA does not believe there is reason to designate these activities
as a separate priority program.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is approving, with an exception, a proposed amendment to the Indiana permanent regulatory program (hereinafter
referred to as the Indiana program) under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The program
amendment consists of revisions to Indiana's Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Rules concerning performance
standards for restoring soil productivity for surface coal mining and reclamation operations under IC 13&hyph;4.1.
The amendment is intended to revise the Indiana program to be consistent with SMCRA and the corresponding Federal
regulations.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On July 29, 1982, the Indiana program was made effective by the conditional approval of the Secretary of the Interior.
Information pertinent to the general background on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the
disposition of comments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval of the Indiana program can be found
in the July 26, 1982

II. Submission of the Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated January 4, 1993 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1193), Indiana submitted a proposed amendment
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
93&hyph;1) intended to address the required program amendments concerning revegetation at 30 CFR 914.16 (i), (j),
(k), (l), and (m). See 57 FR 41869 (September 14, 1992), and 57 FR 22653 (May 29, 1992) for background on these required
amendments. The amendments submitted on January 4, 1993, were reviewed and approved by the Director on August 2, 1993
(58 FR 41039).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By letter dated August 11, 1994 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1392), Indiana submitted formal program
amendment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
94&hyph;3. The proposed program amendment concerns the performance standards for restoring soil productivity
for surface coal mining and reclamation operations under IC 13&hyph;4.1. In its submittal of this amendment, Indiana
stated that all of the rules, except 310 IAC 12&hyph;4&hyph;16, were submitted in a previous package (amendment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
93&hyph;1) and approved by OSM August 2, 1993. In addition, 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c), which was approved as
part of amendment 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
93&hyph;1 has been deleted and does not appear in this submittal. Indiana stated that as a result of ongoing Federal
litigation over the language of the previously-submitted subsection (c) of 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145, IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c)
will not be resubmitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection 16(c)(3)(A) is amended by deleting the word ``or'' and replacing that word with ``and.'' As amended, subsection
16(c)(3)(A) provides that Phase III bond may be released only after: (A) the operator has successfully completed
all surface coal mining and reclamation activities required in IC 13&hyph;4.1, 310 IAC 12, ``and'' the permit. The
Director finds this change to be no less stringent than SMCRA at sections 509(a) and 519(c)(3), and no less effective
than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c)(3).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Indiana has deleted subsection 145(c) which was approved by OSM on August 2, 1993 (58 FR 41039). Deleted subsection
145(c) contained the following language: ``Soil reconstruction shall be carried out in accordance with the specifications
of the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture establishing prime farmland
soil reconstruction specifications for Indiana.'' In its submittal of this amendment Indiana tated that the language
quoted above was omitted because of ongoing litigation concerning the language of subsection 145(c). The litigation
which Indiana referred to above is

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 823.4(b) provide that the regulatory authority within each State shall use the soil-reconstruction
specifications established by the SCS to carry out the State's responsibilities concerning prime farmland. Prior
to the #93&hyph;1 program amendment Indiana had no counterpart to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 823.4(b). Indiana
added a counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b) at 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c) in amendment #93&hyph;1, and OSM approved
the addition. In the #94&hyph;3 amendment, Indiana has removed the counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b), due to the lawsuit
cited above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The lawsuit cited above involves the following. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia has held that
the SCS's specifications for prime farmland soil reconstruction must be promulgated as ``rules'' under the Federal
Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 551 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, and must be subject to public comment prior to becoming effective.

, No. 79&hyph;1144 (D.D.C. October 1, 1984), slip. Op. pp. 23&hyph;24. The Indiana Coal Council, Inc. (ICC) contends
that an Indiana counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b) should not be approved by OSM until after the SCS has complied with the
requirement to subject its ``specifications'' to public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OSM had required that Indiana promulgate a regulation addressing the requirements of 30 CFR 823.4(b). (57 FR 41873,
September 14, 1992). When Indiana proposed 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c) as the counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b),
OSM removed the required amendment at 30 CFR 914.16(l). (58 FR 41042, August 2, 1993.) Since Indiana has now deleted
310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c), the State's program again lacks a counterpart to 30 CFR 823.4(b). Therefore, the
Director finds that the deletion of 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c) renders the Indiana program less effective than
the Federal regulations. Consequently, the Director is requiring that Indiana amend its program to include a counterpart
to 30 CFR 823.4(b) or to otherwise require that any prime farmland soil reconstruction specifications promulgated
as rules for the State of Indiana by the SCS be incorporated by reference into the Indiana program.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 47574). The comment period closed on October 17, 1994. No one commented and no one requested an opportunity to

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator
of the EPA with respect to any provisions of a State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards
promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.). The Director has determined that this amendment contains no provisions in these categories and that EPA's concurrence
is not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA. EPA responded by letter
dated September 27, 1994 (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1402). In that letter, the EPA stated that it had
no comments on the proposed amendment.

V. Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the findings above, the Director is approving, except as noted herein, Indiana's program amendment concerning
performance standards for restoring soil productivity submitted by Indiana on August 11, 1994. As discussed in Finding
2, the Director has determined that the deletion of 310 IAC 12&hyph;5&hyph;145(c) renders the Indiana program less
effective than the Federal regulations. The Director is requiring that Indiana amend its program to include a counterpart
to 30 CFR 823.4(b) or to otherwise require that any prime farmland soil reconstruction specifications promulgated
as rules for the State of Indiana by the SCS be incorporated by reference into the Indiana program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 914 codifying decisions concerning the Indiana program are being amended to
implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment
process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue
delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Effect of Director's Decision
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved
by the Secretary. Similarly, 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted
to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved
by OSM. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In
his oversight of the Indiana program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations and other materials
approved by him, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require
the enforcement by Indiana of only such provisions.

VI. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice
Reform) and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections
(a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory
programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM.
Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions
on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination
of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other
requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.

National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides
that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within
the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an
economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements
previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule

 on April 4, 1994. The revisions concern rules from the following air pollution control districts: Yolo-Solano Air
Pollution Control District (Yolo-Solano APCD), Placer County Air Pollution Control District (Placer County APCD),
and Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD). This approval action will incorporate
these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions
of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA
or the Act). The revised rules control VOC emissions from cleaning and degreasing operations. Thus, EPA is finalizing
the approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals,
SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 4, 1994 in 59 FR 15691, EPA proposed to approve the following rules into the California SIP: Yolo-Solano APCD's
Rule 2.24_Surface Cleaning Operations, Placer County APCD's Rule 216_Degreasing Operations, and Ventura County
APCD's Rule 74.6_Surface Cleaning and Degreasing. Rule 2.24 was adopted by Yolo-Solano APCD on November 14, 1990,
Rule 216 was adopted by Placer County APCD on September 25, 1990, and Rule 74.6 was adopted by Ventura County APCD on
December 10, 1991. These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on May 13, 1991, April
5, 1991, and June 19, 1992, respectively. These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA
section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology
(RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act.
A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the NPRM
cited above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated all of the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA
interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the
NPRM cited above. EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule
provisions and evaluations has been provided in 59 FR 15691 and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at
EPA's Region IX office (TSDs dated August 6, 1993 for Rules 2.24, 216, and 74.6).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 21, 1994 in 59 FR 48410, EPA proposed to approve the following rule into the California SIP: SBCAPCD's
Rule 342, Control of Oxides of Nitrogen (NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
X
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) from Boilers, Steam Generators, and Process Heaters. Rule 342 was adopted by SBCAPCD on March 10, 1992. The California
Air Resources Board (CARB) submitted this rule to EPA on June 19, 1992. Rule 342 was adopted as part of Santa Barbara
County's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to Section
182(f) NO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 RACT requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has evaluated Rule 342 for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation
of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPRM cited above.
EPA has found that the rule meets the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and
evaluation has been provided in 59 FR 48410 and in the technical support document (TSD), dated May 1994 available at
EPA's Region IX office.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 19, 1994 and August 24, 1994. The revisions concern rules from the following districts: the San Diego County
Air Pollution Control District (SDCAPCD), the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD),
and the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD). This approval action will incorporate these rules
into the Federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act).
The revised rules control VOC emissions from surface cleaning and degreasing operations, oil sump operations, storage
of materials containing VOCs, and operations related to the loading of marine tank vessels. Thus, EPA is finalizing
the approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals,
SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.

On August 24, 1994 in 59 FR 43521, EPA proposed to approve the following rules into the California SIP: SDCAPCD Rule
67.6, Solvent Cleaning Operations; SDCAPCD Rule 67.17, Storage of Materials Containing Volatile Organic Compounds;
SJVUAPCD Rule 461.1, Organic Solvent Degreasing Operations; and SJVUAPCD Rule 465.2, Crude Oil Production Sumps.
SCAQMD Rule 1142, Marine Tank Vessel Operations, was proposed for approval into the California SIP on July 19, 1994
in 59 FR 36731. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

by the CARB on January 28, 1992. These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A)
requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone
in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amended Act. A detailed discussion
of the background for each of the above rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the Notices of Proposed Rulemaking
(NPRMs) cited above.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA approves the State implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Montana with a letter dated March
2, 1994. This submittal addresses the Federal Clean Air Act requirement to submit contingency measures for both particulate
matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) and for carbon monoxide (CO) for the areas in Missoula designated as nonattainment for the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Further, this submittal satisfies several commitments made
by the State in a previous PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP submittal. Due to the completion of those commitments, EPA is approving the related rules of the Missoula City-County
Air Pollution Control Program, as adopted by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences (MBHES) on June
28, 1991 and amended on March 20, 1992 and November 19, 1993, and submitted by the Governor in letters dated August 20,
1991, June 4, 1992, and March 2, 1994. These rules include regulations regarding inspections, emergency procedures,
minor source construction permitting, open burning, and wood waste burners. EPA also approves minor revisions to
the previously approved Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's Chapters VII and VIII, as included
in the March 2, 1994 submittal. Further, EPA is declining to take action on Missoula's minor source operating permit
regulations. Finally, EPA disapproves Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's Chapter X, Variances,
which was submitted on August 20, 1991.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Missoula, Montana area was designated nonattainment for PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean
Air Act Amendments of 1990.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 See 56 FR 56694 (Nov. 6, 1991); 40 CFR 81.327 (Missoula and vicinity). The air quality planning requirements for moderate
PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIPs and
SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the Act, including those State submittals containing moderate PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment area SIP requirements (see generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992)).
Because EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble
for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of title I advanced in this action and the supporting rationale.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas such as Missoula were required to submit, among other things, several provisions by November

 nonattainment area SIP (59 FR 2537&hyph;2540, January 18, 1994). Such States were also required to submit contingency
measures by November 15, 1993 (see 57 FR 13543). These measures must become effective, without further action by the
State or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve reasonable further progress (RFP) or to
attain the PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

On November 15, 1990, the Missoula area was also designated nonattainment and classified as a moderate area for CO
by operation of law. See section 107(d)(4)(B) of the Act; 56 FR 56694 at 56705&hyph;56706, 56790 (November 6, 1991);
40 CFR 81.327 (Missoula and vicinity). Unlike PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas, moderate CO areas with a design value of less than or equal to 12.7 parts per million (including
Missoula) are not required by the Act to submit a SIP demonstrating attainment of the NAAQS. Rather, these areas are
required to submit certain SIP elements, including an oxygenated fuels program, an emissions inventory, and contingency
measures. Section 172(c)(9) of the Act requires the State to submit contingency measures for implementation in the
event that the area fails to reach attainment by the applicable attainment date (December 31, 1995). EPA has established
November 15, 1993 as the deadline by which the contingency measures must be submitted to EPA as a SIP revision.

II. This Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566).
The Governor of Montana submitted revisions to the SIP for Missoula with a letter dated March 2, 1994. The revisions
address contingency measures for PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO, and they also amend several of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA approved a large portion of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program on January 18, 1994 (59 FR 2537&hyph;2540).
Some of the local regulation amendments, which are included in the March 2, 1994 submittal, were made to satisfy commitments
made by the Governor with the original PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP submittal. In the January 18, 1994 rulemaking, EPA delayed action on the regulations related to the Governor's
commitments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To address deficiencies identified by EPA, the State took commitments through the public hearing process on November
23, 1992, and submitted the commitments to EPA as additional tasks to be completed to correct the deficiencies in the
Missoula and statewide SIP (a more detailed discussion of these commitments can be found in EPA's prior proposed rulemaking

 SIP revisions for Missoula (58 FR 48339, September 15, 1993), the Technical Support Document (TSD) for that action,
Section II.E. below, and the TSD for this action). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Due to the satisfaction of those commitments, EPA is now approving the following Missoula City-County Air Pollution
Control Program regulations as adopted by the State of Montana on June 28, 1991 and submitted to EPA by Montana's Governor
on August 20, 1991, with amendments adopted by the State on March 20, 1992 and November 19, 1993 and submitted to EPA
by the Governor on June 4, 1992 and March 2, 1994, respectively: Chapter IX_Subchapter 4, Emergency Procedures; Subchapter
13, Open Burning; and Subchapter 14, Rule 1407, Wood-Waste Burners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is also approving the following minor revisions to two previously approved chapters of the Missoula City-County
Air Pollution Control Program_revisions to Chapter VII, involving a name change for the advisory council, and revisions
to Chapter VIII, regarding inspections. These revisions were also adopted by the State on November 19, 1993 and were
included in the March 2, 1994 submittal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act requires States to observe certain procedural requirements in developing implementation plans and plan
revisions for submission to EPA. Section 110(a)(2) of the Act provides that each implementation plan submitted by
a State must be adopted after reasonable notice and public hearing.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 110(l) of the Act similarly provides that each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under
the Act must be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing.

EPA also must determine whether a submittal is complete and therefore warrants further EPA review and action (see
Section 110(k)(1) and 57 FR 13565). The EPA's completeness criteria for SIP submittals are set out at 40 CFR part 51,
appendix V. The EPA attempts to make completeness determinations within 60 days of receiving a submission. However,
a submittal is deemed complete by operation of law if a completeness determination is not made by EPA six months after
receipt of the submission.

To entertain public comment, the State of Montana, after providing adequate notice, held public hearings for the
local air pollution control program on June 28, 1991 and March 2, 1992, and a hearing was held on November 19, 1993 to
address the Missoula contingency measures and further revisions to the local air pollution control program regulations.
Following the public hearings, the local air pollution control plan, revisions, and the Missoula contingency measures
were adopted by the State. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The local air pollution control program was submitted as a proposed revision to the SIP by the Governor with a letter
dated August 20, 1991. In a letter to the State dated December 4, 1991, EPA identified deficiencies with the local program.
Some of these deficiencies were addressed in the Missoula PM

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP, which was submitted by the Governor to EPA in a letter dated June 4, 1992. Commitments to correct the remaining
deficiencies were submitted by the Governor in a letter dated November 30, 1992. EPA described the commitments and
approved the provisions of the local program that were not affected by these commitments on January 18, 1994 (59 FR
2537). A detailed description of the Missoula City-County regulations that are the subject of this action, the deficiencies
that EPA identified in its December 4, 1991 letter to the State, the State's commitments to address these deficiencies,
and the current revisions is contained in the TSD for this action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SIP revisions were reviewed by EPA to determine completeness in accordance with the completeness criteria set
out at 40 CFR part 51, appendix V. The submittals were found to be complete and letters dated December 4, 1991, December
11, 1992, and May 12, 1994 were forwarded to the Governor indicating the completeness of the submittals and the next
steps to be taken in the review process.

B. Contingency Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Clean Air Act requires State's containing PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas to adopt contingency measures that will take effect without further action by the State or EPA
upon a determination by EPA that an area failed to make reasonable further progress or to timely attain the applicable
NAAQS, as described in section 172(c)(9). See generally 57 FR 13510&hyph;13512 and 13543&hyph;13544. Pursuant
to section 172(b), the Administrator has established a schedule providing that states containing initial moderate
PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 nonattainment areas shall submit SIP revisions containing contingency measures no later than November 15, 1993.
(See 57 FR 13543, n. 3.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The General Preamble further explains that contingency measures for PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 should consist of other available control measures, beyond those necessary to meet the core moderate area control
requirement to implement reasonably available control measures (see Clean Air Act sections 172(c)(1) and 189(a)(1)(C)).
Based on the statutory structure, EPA believes that contingency measures must, at a minimum, provide for continued
progress toward the attainment goal during the interim period between the determination that the SIP has failed to
achieve RFP/provide for timely attainment of the NAAQS and the additional formal air quality planning following
the determination (57 FR 13511).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act similarly requires that states containing certain CO nonattainment areas to adopt contingency measures
that will take effect without further action by the State or EPA upon a determination by EPA that an area failed to make
reasonable further progress or to attain the standards, as described in section 172(c)(9). (``Not Classified''
areas, that is, areas that had a design value less than the 9.0 part per million CO NAAQS at the time of designation, are
not required to submit contingency measures.) Pursuant to section 172(b), the Administrator has established a schedule
providing that states containing areas not exempted from the contingency measure requirement shall submit SIP revisions
containing contingency measures no later than November 15, 1993. EPA guidance (``Technical Support Document to
Aid States with the Development of Carbon Monoxide State Implementation Plans,'' EPA&hyph;452/R&hyph;92&hyph;003,
July 1992) recommends that implementation of the contingency measures provide vehicle miles travelled (VMT) reductions
or emission reductions sufficient to counteract the effect of one year's growth in VMT. However, the Act does not specify
how many contingency measures are needed or the magnitude of emissions reductions that must be provided by these measures.
In the interim period (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, after an area fails to attain and while required additional measures are being adopted due to being reclassified
to serious), EPA believes that contingency measures must provide for continued progress toward the attainment goal.
This would be the minimum requirement and is consistent with the statutory scheme. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 172(c)(9) of the Act specifies that contingency measures shall ``take effect *&blank;*&blank;* without
further action by the State, or the [EPA] Administrator.'' EPA has interpreted this requirement (in the General Preamble
at 57 FR 13512) to mean that no further rulemaking activities by the State or EPA would be needed to implement the contingency
measures. In general, EPA expects all actions needed to affect full implementation of the measures to occur within
60 days after EPA notifies the State of its failure to attain the standard or make RFP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA recognizes that certain actions, such as notification of sources, modification of permits, etc., may be needed
before some measures could be implemented. However, States must show that their contingency measures can be implemented
with minimal further administrative action on their part and with no additional rulemaking action such as public
hearing or legislative review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO contingency measures for Missoula were developed by the Missoula City-County Health Department (MCCHD),
with input from the Montana Department of Health and Environmental Sciences (MDHES). After a local public hearing
on September 16, 1993, the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Board adopted the measures. At its November
19, 1993 MBHES public hearing, the Board adopted the contingency measures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Governor submitted the contingency measures to EPA with a letter dated March 2, 1994. After reviewing the submittal
for conformance with the completeness criteria in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V, EPA determined the submittal to be administratively
and technically complete and notified the Governor of such determination in a letter dated May 12, 1994.

C. Effectiveness of the Contingency Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the re-entrained road dust contingency measure is implemented, the control efficiency of the re-entrained road
dust measures will be 76% in the 24-hour attainment demonstration (an increase of 14% over the control efficiency
of the re-entrained road dust measures in the original SIP attainment demonstration). This calculation takes into
account the expanded area for using washed sand, the existing areas for using washed sand and liquid de-icer, and the
existing street sweeping measures (see the TSD for the Missoula PM

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP for further details on the existing re-entrained road dust strategies). Total reduction from the contingency
measure is calculated to be 4073 pounds of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since no credit was taken for the residential woodburning measures in the original SIP attainment demonstration,
control efficiency from the residential woodburning contingency measure increases in the 24-hour attainment demonstration.
See the TSD for the Missoula PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 SIP for further details on the existing residential woodburning strategies (available at the EPA Region VIII address
listed at the beginning of this notice). Total reduction from the contingency measure would be 12.6 pounds of PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 per day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes this contingency measure is adequate for several reasons. First, the existing Missoula solid fuel burning
device regulation (Rule 1428) is already a very stringent mandatory curtailment program. Any further emissions
reductions through this program are very difficult to achieve. Second, the emissions inventory for the Missoula
area indicates that re-entrained road dust contributes a somewhat higher portion of the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 emissions than residential woodburning. Therefore, the analysis necessary for the contingency measure selection
process most likely will indicate that residential woodburning is not the major contributing source to Missoula's
failure to attain the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NAAQS or make RFP, and that the re-entrained road dust contingency measure should be implemented instead of the woodburning
measure. Finally, the control measures implemented in the PM

3. Residential Woodburning Contingency Measure for CO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the implementation of the residential woodburning contingency measure, Class I devices will not be allowed
to burn during an alert. Assuming a conservative 60% compliance rate, 7,915 pounds of CO per day will be reduced. Since
the estimated one-year growth of vehicle miles travelled (VMT) is 1%, and the CO emissions inventory report has determined
that 140,786 pounds of CO per day are emitted from automobiles, approximately 1,409 pounds of CO per day are needed
for a sufficient amount of reduction from the contingency measure. Therefore, emissions reductions are adequately
met with the implementation of this contingency measure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Early Implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subchapter 3, Contingency Measure Selection Process, of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's
Chapter IX_Regulations, Standards, &amp; Permits_sets out its early implementation policy as follows. For either
the PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or CO contingency measures, early implementation of the measures will not result in the requirement to implement
additional moderate area contingency measures if the area fails to attain the NAAQS or make reasonable further progress
in reducing emissions. However, if Missoula is reclassified to a serious nonattainment area, additional planning
requirements, including, but not limited to, serious area contingency measures, would be necessary. (See 59 FR 41998,
August 16, 1994.)

In a letter dated August 20, 1991, the Governor of Montana submitted to EPA the Missoula City-County Air Pollution
Control Program as a revision to the Montana SIP. EPA's review identified numerous deficiencies, including inconsistencies
with the State regulations, as well as deficiencies similar to those EPA identified in the State regulations. In a
December 4, 1991 letter from the EPA Region VIII Administrator to the Governor of Montana, the deficiencies in the
Missoula regulations were outlined in detail (this letter is available for public inspection at the EPA Region VIII
address listed at the beginning of this notice). The problem areas included rules involving emergency procedures,
permitting, open burning, wood-waste burners, National standards of performance for new stationary sources (NSPS),
National emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAPs), and variances.

The revisions to the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations, which were submitted by the
Governor with a letter dated March 2, 1994, fulfill four of the State's commitments (see A, B, C, and E above). However,
EPA still has concerns with respect to the minor source operating permit regulations (see below). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional information submitted to Doug Skie, EPA, from Jeff Chaffee, MDHES, in a letter dated June 9, 1994 fulfills
one more commitment (see D above). In this letter, the State indicated that there is no need for Missoula to revise its
open burning regulations. The State revised its open burning regulations to prohibit the burning of creosote railroad
ties (revisions adopted by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences at its May 20, 1994 hearing), and
the Missoula regulation already prohibits such burning. Therefore, the State does not believe that revisions to
Missoula's open burning regulations are required at this time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Therefore, EPA is now approving the following portions of Chapter IX of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control
Program, as submitted in a letter dated August 20, 1991, with revisions submitted in letters dated June 4, 1992 and
March 2, 1994_Subchapters 4 and 13, and Subchapter 14, Rule 1407_addressing emergency procedures, open burning,
and wood-waste burners, respectively. EPA is also approving all portions of Subchapter 11_Permit, Construction,
and Operation of Air Contaminant Sources_except Rules 1102(3), 1105(2), and 1111(2). The portions of Subchapter
11 that EPA is approving relate to construction permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA is approving Missoula's construction permit regulations of Subchapter 11 as part of the SIP, EPA's approval
does not include Missoula's minor source operating permit regulations, which are found in Chapter IX: Subchapter
11, Rules 1102(3), 1105(2), and 1111(2). EPA is declining to take action on these minor source operating permit regulations
because they do not meet the criteria of the June 28, 1989 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice, which are required in order for the minor source operating permits to be considered federally enforceable
(see 54 FR 27282). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also included in the March 2, 1994 submittal are minor amendments to two previously approved chapters of the Missoula
City-County Air Pollution Control Program. These revisions involve a name change for the air advisory council listed
in Chapter VII, and amendments to Chapter VIII, to provide for emergency episode inspections of operating point sources,
which are capable of emitting 25 tons or more per year of any regulated air pollutant, to ensure compliance with abatement
plan requirements. EPA approves these revisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's concerns regarding Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, Chapter X, Variances, as included
with the August 20, 1991 submittal, have not been addressed. In the December 4, 1991 letter to the Governor, EPA informed
the State that section 110(i) of the Federal Clean Air Act, as amended, prohibits the suspension of any requirement
of an applicable SIP from being taken with respect to a stationary source by a State or the Administrator of EPA, except
by SIP revision under section 110(a) (and a few other exceptions). Neither the June 4, 1992 submittal, nor the March
2, 1994 submittal, corrected this problem. Therefore, EPA must disapprove Missoula's Chapter X, Variances, at this
time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the November 30, 1992 Governor's commitments regarding Missoula is still outstanding. That commitment addresses
Missoula NSPS and NESHAP regulations (see (F), above). EPA will take separate action on those regulations, as appropriate.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
F. Enforceability Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All measures and other elements in the SIP must be enforceable by the State and EPA (see Sections 172(c)(6), 110(a)(2)(A)
and 57 FR 13556). The EPA criteria addressing the enforceability of SIPs and SIP revisions were stated in a September
23, 1987 memorandum (with attachments) from J. Craig Potter, Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (see 57 FR 13541). State implementation plan provisions also must contain a program to provide for enforcement of
control measures and other elements in the SIP [see section 110(a)(2)(C)]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific measures contained in the Missoula contingency plan are addressed above in Section II.B. The Missoula
air pollution control regulations, as included in the SIP, are legally enforceable by MCCHD. There are civil penalties,
which increase with each violation, for noncompliance with the solid fuel burning device regulation. Violation
of any other provision, regulation or rule enforced under the program results in a criminal offense punishable by
a fine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations are also enforceable by the MDHES, if the MCCHD
fails to administer the program. Since the program has been approved by the MBHES in accordance with Section 75&hyph;2&hyph;301
of the Montana Clean Air Act and effectuated by an MBHES order, and since the MDHES can enforce MBHES orders, the MDHES
has independent enforcement powers. Enforcement provisions are found in the Clean Air Act of Montana, Sections 75&hyph;2&hyph;401&hyph;429,
Montana Code Annotated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a State relies on a local government for the implementation of any plan provision, then, according to Section 110(a)(2)(E)(iii)
of the Act, the State must provide necessary assurances that the State has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation
of such plan provision. A State would have responsibility to ensure adequate implementation if, for example, the
State has the authority and resources to implement the provision when the local entity has failed to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program was established in accordance with the requirements of Section
75&hyph;2&hyph;301 of the Montana Clean Air Act, as amended (1991). A revised version of the air pollution control
regulations was approved by the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Board on April 24, 1991, and on June 28,
1991 the MBHES issued a board order approving these regulations. A stipulation between the MDHES and the Missoula
City-County Air Pollution Control Board that delineates responsibilities and authorities between the MDHES and
the local authorities was signed April 29, 1991. On March 20, 1992, the MBHES issued a board order approving revisions
to the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program. The April 29, 1991 stipulation, the June 28, 1991 Board
order, and the March 20, 1992 Board order were incorporated into the SIP on January 18, 1994 (59 FR 2540).

On November 19, 1993, the MBHES issued a Board order approving the Missoula PM

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO contingency measures and revisions to the Missoula City-County regulations. These regulations and the November
19, 1993 Board order were submitted to EPA as a modification to the Montana SIP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Missoula City-County rules are in effect now. The State of Montana has a program that will ensure that the contingency
measures contained in the Missoula SIP are adequately enforced. EPA believes that the State's and Missoula's existing
air enforcement program will be adequate. The TSD for this action contains further information on enforceability
requirements, responsibilities, and a discussion of the personnel and funding intended to support effective implementation
of the control measures.

III. Final Action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving Montana's SIP revisions, submitted by the Governor with a letter dated March 2, 1994, for the Missoula,
Montana nonattainment area. This submittal addressed PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and CO contingency measure plans that were due on November 15, 1993. These plans involve the incorporation of a new
Subchapter 3 (Contingency Measure Selection Process) in Chapter IX of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control
Program and revisions to Chapter IX, Subchapter 14, Rule 1401 (regarding the contingency measure to expand the area
of regulated road sanding materials) and Rule 1428 (regarding the contingency measure to void certain solid fuel
burning device permits). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The March 2, 1994 submittal also revised several Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program regulations,
as committed to be completed by the Governor of Montana to EPA in a letter dated November 30, 1992. Due to the satisfaction
of those commitments, EPA can now approve the following portions of Chapter IX of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution
Control Program, as submitted on August 20, 1991, with revisions submitted June 4, 1992, and March 2, 1994: (1) Subchapter
4, Emergency Procedures; (2) all portions of Subchapter 11, Permit, Construction, and Operation of Contaminant
Sources_except Rules 1102(3), 1105(2), and 1111(2) (the portions of Subchapter 11 that EPA is approving relate to
construction permits); (3) Subchapter 13, Open Burning; and (4) Subchapter 14, Rule 1407, Wood-Waste Burners. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although EPA is approving Missoula's construction permit regulations of Subchapter 11 as part of the SIP, EPA's approval
does not include Missoula's minor source operating permit regulations. EPA is declining to take action on Missoula's
minor source operating permit regulations, which are found in Chapter IX: Subchapter 11, Rules 1102(3), 1105(2),
and 1111(2), because they do not meet the criteria of the June 28, 1989 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document. These criteria must be met in order for the minor source operating permits to be considered federally enforceable
(see 54 FR 27282). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA also approves minor revisions to previously approved Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program Chapter
VII and Chapter VIII, as included in the March 2, 1994 submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, EPA is disapproving Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, Chapter X, Variances, as adopted
by the MBHES on June 28, 1991, and submitted by the Governor of Montana in a letter dated August 20, 1991. This chapter
is not consistent with section 110(i) of the Clean Air Act, which prohibits any State or EPA from granting a variance
from any requirement of an applicable implementation plan with respect to a stationary source. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment
and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. Under the
procedures established in the May 10, 1994 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 24054), this action will be effective February 13, 1995 unless, by January 12, 1995, adverse or critical comments
are received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If such comments are received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent
final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action.
Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the
public is advised that this action will be effective on February 13, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government
entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approvals of SIP submittals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements,
but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval
does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on small entities affected.
Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the Clean Air Act, preparation of a regulatory
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's disapproval_of the portion of the submittal containing Missoula's variance rule_under section 110 and subchapter
I, part D of the Clean Air Act does not affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing
Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the state submittal does not
affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements.
Therefore, EPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number
of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements.

Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United
States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by February 13, 1995. Filing a petition for reconsideration by
the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor
does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review must be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness
of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section
307(b)(2)).

The Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's Chapter X, Variances, which was adopted by the Montana
Board of Health and Environmental Sciences on June 28, 1991 and submitted by the Governor of Montana to EPA in a letter
dated August 20, 1991, is disapproved. This rule is inconsistent with section 110(i) of the Clean Air Act, which prohibits
any State or EPA from granting a variance from any requirement of an applicable implementation plan with respect to
a stationary source.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act (HMTUSA) of 1990, Public Law 101&hyph;615, enacted on
November 16, 1990, amends the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMTA) (49 U.S.C. Appendix 1801 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
) by authorizing the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the National Institutes of Health
to administer a program of grants to qualified non-profit organizations for the purpose of providing training and
education to hazardous materials employees regarding the safe unloading, loading, handling, storage and transportation
of hazardous materials and emergency preparedness for responding to accidents or incidents involving the transportation
of hazardous materials in order to meet the training requirements issued under section 106(b) of the HMTA. Section
118 of the HMTA directs NIEHS to administer the Hazmat Employee Training Grant Program in consultation with the Secretary
of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The grants are funded from the collection of fees, as specified
under section 117A(h) of the HMTA, which are collected from the transporters of hazardous materials on an annual basis.
Funds to support the grant program are transferred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from DOT to NIEHS on an annual basis through an Interagency Agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule amends regulations at 42 CFR part 65 governing the NIEHS Hazardous Waste Worker Training Grants Program
to make them applicable to the new Hazmat Employee Training Grants Program. Specifically, the authority citation
for part 65 is amended to include the authority for the new training grants (49 U.S.C. App. 1816); &sect;65.1 is amended
by revising paragraphs (a), (b) concluding text and (c) introductory text to set forth the applicability of part 65
to the Hazmat Employee Training Grant Program; and &sect;65.2 is amended by deleting the definition of ``Act'' and
adding definitions of the acronyms ``SARA'' and ``HMTA'' and by revising the definition of ``Award or grant.'' Additionally,
references to ``section 126 of the Act'' found in sections 65.1, 65.4 and 65.5 of the part 65 are revised to read ``section
126 of the SARA or section 118 of the HMTA.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, Public Law 103&hyph;227, enacted on March 31, 1994, prohibits smoking in certain facilities in which minors
will be present. The Department of Health and Human Services is now preparing to implement the provisions of that law.
Until those implementation plans are in place, PHS continues to strongly encourage all grant recipients to provide
a smoke-free workplace and promote the nonuse of all tobacco products.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On September 29, 1993, NIH published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 announcing our plans to amend the regulations governing the Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program at 42 CFR part
65 by making these changes and invited public comment. We received two comments on the proposed changes. These comments
were received from the George Meany Center for Labor Studies and the Chemical Waste Transportation Institute of the
National Solid Wastes Management Association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The George Meany Center for Labor Studies suggested that the inclusion of both planning grants and program grants
in part 65 is inconsistent with section 118(c) of the amended HMTA which restricts funding to ``non-profit organizations
which previously have demonstrated their expertise in implementing and operating hazmat employee training and
education programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While planning grants are an option for NIEHS in the overall training program under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization
Act of 1986 (SARA), it would not be an option with the HMTA Hazmat Employee Training Grant Program since the statute
is so narrowly drawn. In response to the comment, we have clarified &sect;65.1 (c) to indicate that planning grants
are available only under SARA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Chairman of the Chemical Waste Transportation Institute suggested the title heading of part 65 be expanded to
make reference to both types of grants programs. He suggested the heading be altered to read: ``NIEHS Hazardous Waste
Worker Training and Hazmat Employee Training Grant Programs.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 NIEHS prefers to retain the original title heading of part 65 which is generically descriptive of the kinds of programs
covered, including additions of new programs related to hazardous waste worker training and additions to a program's
purview and statutory authority. The public will be notified of the availability of funds for particular programs
through the standard process of the issuance by NIH of Requests for Applications (RFA). Hence, there is no need for
changing the program's general title with every new statutory or regulatory amendment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, no changes have been made in the proposed rule, except for minor editorial changes.

Regulatory Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order No. 12866 of September 30, 1993, Regulatory Planning and Review, requires us to prepare an analysis
for any rule that meets one of the E. O. 12866 criteria for a significant regulatory action; that is, that may_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 -->
Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal,
governments, or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set
forth in E.O. 12866. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, we prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5 U.S.C. chapter 6), if the rule is expected to have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this rule merely makes minor changes in the authority citation, applicability section, and definitions
section to incorporate the new Hazmat Employee Training Grant Program authority into part 65, it will have no major
consequential effects on the economy or small entities. Therefore, the Secretary has determined that this rule is
not significant within the definition of E.O. 12866, and the Secretary certifies that this rule will not have a significant
impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Sections 65.4(a), (b) and (c) of part 65 contain information collection requirements subject to Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). The information collection
language in these sections is currently approved under OMB control number 0925&hyph;0348. Response burden in conjunction
with the program is approved under OMB control number 0925&hyph;0001. This rule does not result in any changes in the
language currently approved under control number 0925&hyph;0348.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule establishes as a condition of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation (which facilities must meet in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs) the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement that hospitals have a discharge planning process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for patients who require such services and specifies the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elements of that process. It also changes the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifications of a hospital's medical director. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions implement sections 9305(c) of the Omnibus Budget 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA '86) and 6025 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Also, we are not adopting several minor proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revisions to the conditions for coverage of suppliers of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) services. We are now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developing comprehensive revisions to the ESRD regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and believe that it would be appropriate to reconsider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed changes as part of that rulemaking process.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 16, 1988, we published a proposed rule (53 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22506) concerning discharge planning as a hospital condition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of participation, certain laboratory director qualifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by recent legislation, and proposed revisions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations aimed at reducing paperwork and information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection requirements. In the proposal, we explained that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions of participation (conditions) are the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements that hospitals must meet in order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the Medicare program; hospitals that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in the Medicaid program must meet the same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. These conditions implement sections 1861(e), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f), (k), and (z) of the Social Security Act (the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These conditions are intended to protect patient health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety and to help assure that high-quality care is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided to all patients. The current regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containing the conditions of participation for hospitals are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in the Code of Federal Regulations at 42 CFR Part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
482, Subparts A, B, C, D, and E. Providers are surveyed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a State survey agency to ensure that they meet our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation requirements. (Our regulations concerning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey and certification procedures for providers affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by this rule are at 42 CFR Part 488 unless otherwise noted.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospitals accredited by the Joint Commission on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) or the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
American Osteopathic Association (AOA) are deemed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1865 of the Act and &sect;488.5 of our regulations to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet most of our requirements in the hospital conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation and need not be routinely surveyed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Failure to meet a condition of participation may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardize the continuation of a facility's participation in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Medicare or Medicaid program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Discharge Planning Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the past 20 years, the average length of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital stay has become significantly shorter for a number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of reasons. Factors contributing to this reduction include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment methods for hospitals, such as Medicare's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prospective payment system, which furnishes incentives to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals to retain only those patients needing care that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be safely furnished only in the inpatient hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
setting. Additionally, increases in the aged population, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coupled with shorter lengths of hospital stays, have created 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a demand for rehabilitative and restorative treatments in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-hospital settings that can be furnished after hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge. To assure the coordination needed to achieve a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely transition to post-hospital care, discharge planning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is necessary. It enables a hospital and patient to arrange 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for services that do not need to be furnished in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inpatient hospital setting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Our current regulations do not require discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning as a distinct condition of participation. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we include as a standard under the quality assurance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition (42 CFR 482.21(b)) the requirement that a hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have an effective, ongoing discharge planning program that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitates the provision of followup care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We require the hospital to initiate the discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning process in a timely manner and to transfer or refer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patients, along with necessary medical information, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate facilities, agencies or outpatient services, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed, for followup or ancillary services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Clinical Laboratory Director Standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to assure the health and safety of patients, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
our conditions of participation for hospitals and conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for coverage of services of laboratories include standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that personnel, including laboratory directors, must meet. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The clinical laboratory director requirements apply in all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, including those that have adopted their own 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualification requirements. When OBRA '86 was enacted, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it specified in section 9339(d) that if a State has standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a clinical laboratory director (including a hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory director) must meet, directors who meet these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards will be considered as meeting Federal standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We included this provision in our June 16, 1988 proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. Subsequently, on October 31, 1988, the enactment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(CLIA), Public Law 100&hyph;578, drastically revised laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements, obviating the proposal. Because the Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision has been superseded, we are withdrawing our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal and not discussing public comments in this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule. (See our February 28, 1992 final rule (57 FR 7002) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the regulations implementing clinical laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
director requirements under CLIA.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Other Revisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following the summary of changes made to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule based on our evaluation of public comments, we discuss 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in section VI of this preamble technical changes to our 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations concerning hospital medical director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifications. An unrelated change inserts in regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the new name adopted by the accrediting program of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These changes were not issued in a proposed rule. The first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change is technical and conforms the rules to the statute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without interpretation, while the second change merely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
updates the rules by substituting the new name of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accrediting program.

II. Legislation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9305 (c)(1) and (c)(2) of OBRA '86 amends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1861(e) of the Act, which defines ``hospital'', by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adding to paragraph (6) a requirement that a hospital have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in place a discharge planning process that meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of a new section 1861(ee) of the Act. Under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 1861(ee), a discharge planning process of a hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is sufficient if it applies to services furnished by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and meets the guidelines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and standards established by the Secretary of HHS to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a timely and smooth transition to the most appropriate type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of setting for post-hospital or rehabilitative care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1861(ee) requires that the Secretary's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards and guidelines include the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The hospital must identify, at an early stage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitalization, those patients who are likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suffer adverse health consequences if discharged without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate discharge planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Hospitals must provide a discharge planning evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the patients identified under (1) above and for other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patients upon request of the patient or his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative or physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Any discharge planning evaluation must be made on a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely basis to ensure that appropriate arrangements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
post-hospital care will be made before discharge and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoid unnecessary delays in discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A discharge planning evaluation must include an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of a patient's likely need for appropriate post-hospital services and the availability of those services.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The discharge planning evaluation must be included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the patient's medical record for use in establishing an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate discharge plan, and the results of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation must be discussed with the patient or his or her 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Upon the request of a patient's physician, the hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must arrange for the development and initial implementation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a discharge plan for the patient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Any discharge planning evaluation or discharge plan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required under section 1861(ee) of the Act must be developed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by, or under the supervision of, a registered professional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nurse, social worker, or other appropriately qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
personnel. (Although the statute refers to a ``registered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
professional nurse,'' both in this provision and in section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1861(e)(5) of the Act, there is no distinction between this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term and ``registered nurse,'' which is more commonly used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We will hereafter use the term ``registered nurse'', to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consistent with other references in our regulations.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 9305(c)(3) of OBRA '86 amends section 1865(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act so that, in effect, when the JCAHO or AOA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires hospitals to have a discharge planning process or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
imposes a requirement that serves substantially the same purpose as the condition of participation for discharge

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning, the Secretary is authorized to find that those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals with JCAHO or AOA accreditation meet that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provisions of section 9305(c) of OBRA '86 were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective October 21, 1987.

III. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On June 16, 1988, we published a proposed rule to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement these legislative changes as well as the clinical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory director standards revisions mentioned earlier 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(53 FR 22506). We also proposed several minor revisions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the conditions for coverage of suppliers of ESRD services to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accommodate a request from the Office of Management and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget concerning paperwork burden and reporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Discharge Planning Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To implement section 9305(c) of OBRA '86, we proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to incorporate the provisions of the statute and would add a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new hospital condition of participation, &sect;482.43, Discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning, which would have applied only to Medicare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patients. We proposed to delete the current discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning requirement in &sect;482.21, Quality assurance, as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
medically-related patient care service standard applicable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to all patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1861(ee) of the Act confers authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include standards and guidelines beyond those explicitly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enumerated in the statute. We proposed to specify that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning evaluation include an evaluation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Medicare patient's capacity for self-care or the possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this patient being cared for in the environment from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which he entered the hospital. Under the requirements for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the discharge plan, we would require, on an as-needed basis, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Medicare patient and family members or interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons be counseled to prepare them for post-hospital care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For clarity, we wanted to include the concept in the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation explicitly requiring the actual transfer or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referral of Medicare patients after discharge planning is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete. We also proposed to require periodic reassessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Medicare patient's discharge plan to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether it needs to be changed. We would also require the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital to reassess its discharge planning process on an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ongoing basis to ensure that it meets Medicare patients' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge needs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We deferred proposing any requirements relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs assessment instrument that is being developed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary as required by section 9305(h) of OBRA '86. On 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 30, 1992, HHS submitted a report on the needs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment instrument to Congress including recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for further testing and development of the instrument.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statutory requirement, under section 1861(ee) of the Act, mandating the inclusion of discharge planning into
the hospital conditions of participation, explicitly applies only to Medicare beneficiaries. Although we believed
the Secretary had the authority to expand the application of the provision beyond the statutorily mandated population,
we did not choose to do so at the time we published the proposed rule, in part because we believed that additional development
of mechanisms for effectively completing and executing discharge plans was warranted before a requirement as detailed
as this one was made applicable beyond the mandated population. We have since changed our view and now are applying
the requirement to all patients who need it. (See section IV., ``Comments and Responses'', below for further discussion
of this issue.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the time of the proposal, we had not yet made a determination as authorized under section 9305(c)(3) as to whether
the JCAHO or AOA discharge planning standards were at least equivalent to the statutory standards and guidelines
in section 1861(ee) of the Act. Our current regulations at 42 CFR 488.5, as redesignated from 42 CFR 405.1901(d)(3)
on June 17, 1988 (53 FR 22850), already provide that JCAHO and AOA accredited hospitals are deemed to meet our conditions
of participation unless our requirements are higher or more precise. We indicated that we would review each organization's
standards to determine if they are at least equivalent and invited comments on this issue. We requested comments from
the public on this issue and proposed to announce in the final rule whether hospital compliance with the JCAHO or AOA
accreditation programs would provide the Secretary with a ``reasonable assurance'' that the hospital met the new
condition of participation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new section 1861(ee)(2)(B) includes the requirement that hospitals provide discharge planning evaluations
upon the request of the ``patient, patient's representative, or patient's physician.'' We proposed to characterize
``patient's representative'' in &sect;482.43(b)(1) as any properly authorized ``person acting on the patient's
behalf.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed not to require hospitals to inform Medicare patients of the availability of discharge planning services
separately from other information furnished. Currently, hospitals give all Medicare patients a notice (``An Important
Message from Medicare'') that informs beneficiaries, among other things, of the availability of discharge planning.
This message was designed to help Medicare patients who may believe they need post-hospital services but do not know
how to obtain them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We proposed to allow hospitals to determine the appropriate personnel to carry out the discharge planning. In proposed
&sect;&sect;482.43(b)(2) and 482.43(c)(1), we stated that a registered nurse, social worker, or other appropriate
personnel (consistent with available community and hospital resources) must develop or supervise the development
of the evaluation and discharge plan. We did not stipulate in the regulation what qualifications would need to be related
to the size and location of the hospital and the variety of resources available for post-discharge care in the area.
In our interpretive guidelines, though, we would instruct the surveyor to look at such factors as previous experience
in discharge planning, knowledge of clinical and social factors that affect functional status at discharge, knowledge
of community resources to meet post-discharge clinical and social needs, and assessment skills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be compatible with our other regulations we proposed to divide this condition of participation into several standards:
the first, identification of Medicare patients in need of evaluation; the second, the evaluation process; the third,
the discharge plan; and the fourth, referral or transfer of the Medicare patient, along with necessary medical information.
(The statute does not explicitly require actual transfer or referral of patients after discharge planning is complete,
so we proposed to retain, for clarity, the concept of current &sect;482.21(b)(2).) A fifth standard would require
an ongoing reassessment of the discharge planning process to ensure that discharge plans are responsive to discharge
needs of individual Medicare patients. Because the requirements in &sect;482.43 (a), (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(5),
(b)(6), and (c)(2) would be those required by section 1861(ee) of the Act, failure to meet any of these requirements
could result in termination of the hospital's participation agreement in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

B. ESRD Conditions for Coverage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We also proposed several minor revisions to &sect;&sect;405.2135 and 405.2137 of the ESRD conditions for coverage.
The purpose of the changes was to reduce the paperwork burden on ESRD facilities, in keeping with a request from the
office of Management and Budget that we conduct an overall review of the paperwork burden and reporting requirements
associated with HCFA regulations. We received no comments on the proposed changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At this time, however, we are working with representatives of the ESRD industry and consumers to develop comprehensive
revisions to the ESRD conditions for coverage. We believe that it would be confusing and inappropriate to adopt the
minor changes from the June 16, 1988 proposed rule at a time when the ESRD community is anticipating extensive revisions
to the conditions for coverage. Instead, we believe it would be more appropriate to reconsider the proposed changes
as part of our overall revision of the ESRD conditions. Thus, we are not adopting the proposed changes to &sect;&sect;405.2135
and 405.2137.

We received comments from 21 commenters on the proposed discharge planning provision, including a number of favorable
comments. The commenters consisted of hospitals, advocacy groups, local and State government agencies, individuals,
provider and supplier associations, and a medical equipment supplier.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter disagreed with our limiting the new condition of participation to Medicare patients only. He believed
we should extend coverage to all patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree. We believe it is a good management practice for hospitals to assure continuity of care for all patients, and
we recognize that most hospitals achieve this result through discharge planning. In this regard, we note that the
JCAHO, which accredits approximately 6000 hospitals, has a discharge planning requirement that applies to all patients
and that is, in our view, even more comprehensive than the one required under the law and these regulations. The practical
effect of the JCAHO requirement is that discharge planning does apply to all patients in the vast majority of the nation's
hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on our further review of the issue raised by this commenter, we now believe that the requirements in this regulation,
which will be applied in the approximately 1500 hospitals not accredited by the JCAHO, should be applied to all patients
who need them. Accordingly, under the authority contained in section 1861(e)(9) and 1861(ee)(1), we are expanding
the applicability of the discharge planning requirements to all hospital patients who require it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are several reasons why we believe it is appropriate to expand the discharge planning requirement to all patients.
First, expanding the requirement to all patients is consistent with the requirements set forth in current &sect;482.21,
which has been in place since June 17, 1986 (51 FR 22042). Section 482.21(b) includes a discharge planning requirement
that applies to all patients, Moreover, the commenter's suggestion also is consistent with our long-standing position
that the Secretary's responsibility under section 1861(e)(9) of the Act to promulgate health and safety requirements
for hospitals applies to all patients. Rather than limiting the Secretary's responsibilities to Medicare beneficiaries,
section 1861(e)(9) refers to the ``health and safety of individuals who are furnished services in the institution.''
Thus, the statute supports our decision to require that the new discharge planning procedures be applicable, as the
old procedures were, to all of a hospital's patients. Clearly, adequate discharge planning is essential to the health
and safety of all patients. It is not just the Medicare patient that may suffer adverse health consequences upon discharge
without the benefit of appropriate planning. Such planning is vital to mapping a course of treatment aimed at minimizing
the likelihood of having any patient rehospitalized for the reasons that prompted the initial hospital stay. To this
extent, all of the elements of the discharge planning process that Congress has made explicitly applicable to Medicare
beneficiaries are of equal value to all hospital patients in the interests of their health and safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, expanding the scope of the discharge planning provisions would parallel current JCAHO and AOA
requirements, which also apply to all patients. We do not believe that it is administratively feasible to separate
Medicare and other patients for discharge planning purposes. Furthermore, such a separation of Medicare and other
patients for discharge planning purposes might have the adverse affect of fostering a dual level of care system for
Medicare and other patients. The discriminatory aspects of such a situation would be neither desirable nor supportable.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, we do not believe that the cost of expanding the application of the requirement is significant. There will
be no expense in the approximately 6000 hospitals accredited by the JCAHO. Moreover, in the approximately 1500 hospitals
directly subject to the requirement, the marginal impact on hospital staffing is likely to be relatively small. Since
our current hospital conditions of participation already require discharge planning, hospital staff must already
be employed to carry out this function. We believe that the new discharge planning provisions impose only a minimal
additional workload on these staff, and applying these requirements to all patients, rather than just to Medicare
beneficiaries, will not have a significant incremental impact.

Comment: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters explicitly suggested and many others implicitly suggested that we require written policies and procedures
for the discharge planning process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We agree and are revising proposed &sect;482.43 to require the hospital to commit its discharge planning policies
and procedures to writing. This requirement will help assure that the process is well thought out, clear, comprehensive
and understood by all staff. It will also assist in monitoring the process. We believe most hospitals already have
written discharge planning policies and procedures and will have little or no difficulty in complying with this requirement.

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We received five comments on the equivalency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the JCAHO's standards to ours. Two commenters believe the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
JCAHO's standards for discharge planning (and supporting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for social work services and nursing services) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be equivalent to ours, while two believe them not to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We have reviewed JCAHO's 1994 standards and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
find them to be at least equivalent to those in this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation. Included in our determination finding them 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent was a consideration of the JCAHO's standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient assessment and education of patients and family. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are announcing that JCAHO-accredited hospitals that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in Medicare have been found by the Secretary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA to meet the new discharge planning requirement in 42 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR 482.43. Those hospitals will not have to be surveyed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for compliance with this requirement when the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation becomes effective. For these reasons, we believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no revision of the regulations at 42 CFR 488.5(a) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The fifth commenter was philosophically opposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to accepting the equivalency of the JCAHO's discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning standards to ours because he believed a private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency is not accountable to the government for enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of its standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We cannot accept the commenter's contention 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a private agency should not be used to enforce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
government standards, as the statute explicitly authorizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this type of use of a private agency (section 1865(a) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act). In order to ensure that the hospitals the JCAHO 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accredits are meeting standards equivalent to HCFA's, we 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conduct validation surveys under section 1864(c) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospitals found out of compliance with conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation may have their provider agreements terminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if they do not correct their deficiencies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We received one comment concerning the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalency of AOA standards to ours. The commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed that the AOA's discharge planning standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more general than HCFA's but that they would be strengthened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to meet new Medicare standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree that AOA standards on discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning in effect at the time the commenters commented were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not equal to or higher than ours. We are pleased to report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the AOA subsequently revised its standards for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are announcing that AOA-accredited hospitals that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participate in Medicare have been found by the Secretary and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HCFA to meet the new discharge planning requirement in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
42 CFR 482.43. These hospitals will not have to be surveyed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for compliance with this requirement when the final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation becomes effective. For these reasons, we believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no revision of the regulations at 42 CFR 488.5(a) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters believed we should require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospitals to identify all Medicare patients, particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high risk patients, in need of post-hospital care, within 24 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hours of being admitted, including, for one commenter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patients appearing in the emergency room, whether or not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are admitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not agree that a 24-hour limitation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be imposed on the identification requirement. Both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the statute and the regulation require identification to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take place ``at an early stage of hospitalization.'' We think 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this is sufficient because the specific timing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification within that context, we believe, is best left 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the hospital, its staff, and the attending physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Discharge planning presupposes hospital admission and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section 9305(c) of OBRA '86 specifically indicates that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning follows hospitalization. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of &sect;482.43 do not apply to patients who appear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a hospital emergency room but are not admitted as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital inpatients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Three commenters thought we should require each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital to have a policy for developing and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utilizing screening criteria for identifying those patients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whose medical conditions and social circumstances would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
warrant discharge planning and to require that the hospital 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review its criteria annually. As an alternative, they 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suggested that hospitals be required to have a procedure for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying at an early stage patients likely to need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
post-acute care services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We believe the use of an outcome oriented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard is sufficient for the regulation and in accord with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the basic approach used in the June 17, 1986 revision to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions of participation for hospitals (51 FR 22042). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hospitals will be able to choose from many methods to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate compliance with the standard, and we wish to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preserve their flexibility in this regard, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
option of reviewing all Medicare patients admitted to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. An on-going reassessment of the hospital's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning process, which would include any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screening or identification methods, is required in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;482.43(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter wanted us to establish specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria (e.g., age, functional ability, psychosocial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factors and health status), to identify patients who are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to suffer adverse health consequences without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As mentioned in response to the previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment, we want to continue the approach used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 17, 1986 revision to the conditions of participation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for hospitals, which avoided prescriptive administrative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements through the use of language that is stated in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms of expected outcomes, thereby providing hospitals with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater flexibility. Since the criteria suggested by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter are overly prescriptive and not outcome oriented, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
we are not adopting them.

 One commenter suggested that we have as an

alternative to the phrase ``patients who are likely to suffer

adverse health consequences,'' ``patients who are likely to be

Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not believe it is necessary to add this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category of patients because it is subsumed in the original 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
category: someone unable to perform activities of daily

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Two commenters thought that, if there is no

 We do not believe it is necessary to specify in

 One commenter believed there should be a

mandatory written form for the evaluation, preferably in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form of a check-off list. The commenter also thought this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation form should include specified factors, such as

social needs and capacity for self-care.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 At the present time, a nationally used and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepted form for all hospitals does not exist. Section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9305(h) of OBRA '86 requires the Secretary to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uniform needs assessment instrument(s) in consultation with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a panel of experts and to submit a report to Congress, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
makes recommendations for the appropriate use of this

 One commenter wanted us to clarify whether the

patient could request the development and initiation of a

discharge planning evaluation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in &sect;482.43(b)(1), a physician or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient (or patient's representative) may request a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning evaluation.

 One commenter thought the patient's physician 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should explicitly be included in the definition of patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The statute uses the term ``patient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representative'' in addition to references to the patient's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physician, and thus we conclude that the term was not meant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to include physicians. A physician's role is defined by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other Federal requirements such as those found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;482.12(c), the condition of participation on the governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
body concerning care of patients. Not including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient's physician as his representative was not intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to limit or eliminate the role of the physician in decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about a patient's medical care, including the setting in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the care is provided, nor was it meant to imply that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the physician does not serve the patient's interest.

qualified personnel who develop or supervise the development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the evaluation and discharge plan. We also received two

 Four commenters remarked about the provision to

allow ``other appropriately qualified personnel'' to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or supervise the development of the evaluation and discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan. One commenter thought we should omit ``other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 It is our policy to avoid specifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
credentials in the conditions of participation wherever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible. Such requirements could inappropriately restrict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital selection of staff, may superimpose the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of private groups over State law, and do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessarily ensure the provision of quality care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We believe that including the criteria in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretive guidelines will assure that minimum standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are met while allowing State surveyors to monitor the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. In the future we will reevaluate the

have difficulty obtaining and retaining qualified personnel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters believed this provision dilutes the statute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter suggested that as an alternative we add

appropriateness. We agree with the commenters that, in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present circumstances, the parenthetical phrase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inadvertently dilutes the statute. We are not accepting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second comment as to do so would be superfluous; the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of participation for the hospital's governing body 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
already contains a standard at &sect;482.12(e) for all contracted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
services. The hospital's governing body must ensure that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractor for services (including one for shared services 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and joint ventures) furnishes services that permit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 To accept this comment would conflict with the statute, which places ``other appropriate qualified personnel''
as equals in qualifications of registered nurses and social workers. Indeed, these personnel may be more suited for
discharge planning by virtue of credentials or training and in some cases, such as in a rural hospital, it may be a physician
who does the discharge planning. We would like to note that in any event it is a management function of the hospital to
assure proper supervision of its employees and we do not wish to interfere with this function.

Medicare beneficiaries have the freedom to choose the vendor for post-hospital care.

 Section 1802 of the Social Security Act guarantees free choice by Medicare patients. It provides that any individual
entitled to Medicare may obtain health services from any institution, agency, or person qualified to participate
under the Medicare law if the institution, agency, or person undertakes to provide him or her those services. We do
not believe it is necessary to reaffirm this requirement in the standard for discharge planning evaluation. There
is nothing in this rule that prevents a Medicare beneficiary from exercising freedom of choice of a post-hospital
vendor of services.

 We do not believe that this specificity is needed in the regulation. Our approach is consistent with that used in the
June 17, 1986 regulatory revision to the conditions of participation for hospitals, which avoided prescriptive
administrative requirements and use of specific details. Although the factors mentioned by the commenter are relevant,
it is not our intention to create an ``all-inclusive'' list in the regulation. We will consider these, as well as other
factors, when formulating interpretive guidelines.

 We believe the current language of the final regulation, which is stated in terms of expected outcomes, provides hospitals
with sufficient flexibility and is in accord with the philosophy of the June 17, 1986 revision to the conditions of
participation for hospitals. We do not

agree that the degree of specificity desired by the commenter is needed in the regulation. His comments will, however,
be considered for inclusion in the interpretive guidelines.

 Three commenters addressed the inclusion of &sect;482.43(b)(4), which requires an evaluation of the patient's
capacity for self-care or of the possibility of the patient being cared for in the environment from which he or she entered
the hospital. Two commenters believed paragraph (b)(4) to be a positive addition and supported inclusion of this
element in the evaluation. The third commenter stated that &sect;482.43 (b)(3) and (b)(4) are duplicative.

 We disagree with the third commenter. The intent of the two paragraphs is as follows: &sect;483.43(b)(3) reproduces
the statutory provision, while (b)(4) specifies an element that must be included in the evaluation that is not necessarily
apparent from the text of the statute.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed that we should require that more than a patient's capacity for self-care be considered. The
commenter urged that we consider the patient's wishes as well, as some persons with limited 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity for self-care may be cared for at home. Also, the commenter indicated that emphasis on capacity for self-care
can lead to an overemphasis on care in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) rather than by a home health agency (HHA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The patient's wishes are an integral aspect of the capacity for self-care, since the capacity includes not only the
patient's ability for self-care, but also the willingness for such care. There are a variety of services that are provided
equally well by both SNFs and HHAs. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination of which provider is appropriate depends necessarily on other conditions such as ability, availability,
and willingness of caregivers, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of resources in the community, and patient preference. All these factors need to be considered.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed we should emphasize that the hospital should give each beneficiary the full range of options
to consider for post-hospital care rather than focusing on returning him or her to his or her prehospitalization environment,
particularly when the prehospitalization environment is an SNF. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In most instances the focus on a return to the prehospitalization environment is a valid one, serving the interests
of the patient within available community resources. Alternatively, the regulations call for an assessment of the
patient's ability for self-care. We do not believe these alternative elements of the evaluation preclude a patient
from being offered a full range of options to consider for post-hospital care and we see no need to change the regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To allay the commenter's concern, however, we will include a statement in the interpretive guidelines to assure that
patients admitted to a hospital from an SNF are not shortchanged by the hospital discharge planning process. We 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would like to point out that sometimes a patient's expectations of where he or she wants to go after hospital discharge
(e.g., a return to the patient's former residence rather than to the SNF from which he or she was admitted) are not realistic
due to the patient's physical or mental condition, available community resources, or any one or more of these three.

 The purpose of the legislation is to assure that patients receive any necessary discharge planning, not to ensure
that a hospital develops a discharge plan only upon a physician's request. We agree that the physician is important
to the discharge plan, and we included a provision to require a hospital to develop a discharge plan if a physician requests
one, even if the hospital had determined one to be unnecessary. This provision, based on the statute, gives the physician
the final decision as to whether a discharge plan is necessary but does not unnecessarily require his input on a routine
basis.

 Four commenters remarked about the use of the word ``assist'' in &sect;482.43(c)(3), which requires the hospital
to ``assist in implementing the *&blank;*&blank;* discharge plan.'' One commenter liked the word ``assist'' as
it requires the hospital to become involved without placing the entire responsibility on the hospital. Two commenters
objected to the word as it is vague and passive; the statute requires the hospital to be the initiator of discharge planning.
The fourth commenter thought the provision required the hospital to implement the discharge plan.

 We do not believe it desirable to specify a single format and content for a discharge plan. Discharge planning is a discipline
with competing theories and practices, each of which likely carries with it unique 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documentation procedures and formats. We believe the hospital should retain flexibility in deciding the plan's
format and content. As our experience with this requirement develops and as needed, we will develop and revise interpretive
guidelines for survey personnel to assist them in assessing the sufficiency of an acceptable discharge plan.

 It is the hospital's responsibility to assure there is a mechanism for handling discharge planning complaints and

 We do not believe that establishing a specific time before discharge by which a discharge plan must be furnished would
be useful. In some difficult situations, the plan may not be ready until shortly before the patient is discharged;
having the plan ready too long before discharge does not allow for changing circumstances.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The State surveyors, in determining compliance with this condition, will look at whether the hospital developed
discharge plans for patients who needed them and whether the hospital arranged for its initial implementation. The
hospital will be expected to be able to document its decision about the need for a plan, document the existence of plans
where they are needed and show what steps it took to implement those plans initially. In our view, the hospital has the
latitude to accomplish this result in the most efficient way possible. We do not believe that the discharge plan, which
may contain information already in the medical record in the form of clinical notes, for example, is always an essential
part of the patient's formal medical record. We recognize that the JCAHO requires that the discharge plan be entered
into the medical record, and that many hospitals may do it, but we do not believe that making this mandatory in all cases
would serve a useful purpose.

Several commenters remarked about the requirement in &sect;482.43(c)(4) concerning periodic reassessment; one
commenter thought that the reassessment should be based on changes in the patient's condition or progress. Another
commenter wanted to know how the periodic reassessment differs from an assessment on an as-needed basis. The third
commenter believed that the requirement, as written, could apply after discharge and the regulation needs to specify
that the reassessment occurs before discharge.

 We are modifying proposed &sect;482.43(c)(4) to require reassessments on an as-needed basis, based on factors that
may affect continuing care needs or the appropriateness of the discharge plan. We do not agree that the regulation
needs to specify that the reassessment must be done before discharge. The duty for discharge planning ends after discharge,
assuming the hospital has arranged for the initial implementation of the Medicare patient's discharge plans in accordance
with &sect;482.43(c)(3) and has transferred or referred the patient in accordance with &sect;482.43(d).

 One commenter wanted us to specify predetermined times at which the patient and family must be counseled to prepare
for post-hospital care, rather than requiring this counseling on an as-needed basis.

 We do not agree that we should be so specific. Hospital personnel are in the best position to judge the best times to counsel
the patient and family and to accommodate individual situations.

 One commenter thought we should avoid over-utilization of family caregiving systems and use more non-family-based
community resources.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Use of family caregivers occurs in discharge planning only when the family is both willing 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 able to perform needed services. In the absence of such a commitment, it is appropriate to use community resources
that are not family-based.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter thought there is a need for greater identification of the caregiver in the discharge planning process;
in each case, the commenter suggested, we should require the hospital to determine whether there is a caregiver, the
caregiver's willingness and ability to provide care, and mechanisms for preparing families to provide the care.
Another commenter, on the other hand, expressed concern that the regulation text inappropriately advocates the
use of family caregivers in situations where community-based services are available and that we are not providing
the patient his or her choice in such situations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree that identification of family or other caregiver is a key attribute of effective discharge planning and believe
that our regulations at 42 CFR 482.43(b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6) and (c)(5) both appropriately and in a balanced manner
relate to this need.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

provision of specialized instruction or training in post-hospital care.

Comment:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We received four comments on our requirement that a hospital must discharge or transfer the patient after executing
a discharge plan. One commenter thought we were going beyond the intent of the statute and that few hospitals have the
authority to transfer or refer patients; one thought our statement that the statute did not require discharge or transfer
to be misleading; and two commenters were in favor of the provision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While it is true that the statute does not explicitly require the hospital to follow through and actually discharge
or transfer the patient, we believe the requirement is implicit in the purpose of the legislation: to assure that patients
receive proper post-hospital care. This requirement, as with other conditions of participation, must operate within
the constraints of a hospital's authority under State law and within the limits of a patient's right to refuse discharge
planning services. As we stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the proposed requirement is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 new and has been in place for some time.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter remarked that we should strengthen the regulation by requiring hospital discharge planning personnel
to maintain complete and accurate information on community long-term care services and facilities for advising
patients and their representatives of their options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not believe a change in the regulation is warranted. The current outcome-oriented standard is sufficient and
in accord with the regulatory approach used in the June 17, 1986 revision to the conditions of participation for hospitals.
Hospitals will be able to choose from many methods to demonstrate compliance with the standard. We will incorporate
the commenter's suggested language in the interpretive guidelines for the standard and for the on-going reassessment
of the hospital's discharge planning process required in &sect;482.43(e).

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter questioned whether &sect;482.43(d), which requires the hospital to transfer necessary medical information
along with the patient for post-hospital services, is compatible with &sect;482.24(b)(3), which requires release
of information only to authorized individuals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 42 CFR 482.24(b)(3) requires that the hospital have a procedure for insuring confidentiality of patient records.
Information from or copies of records must be released only to authorized individuals and the hospital must ensure
that unauthorized individuals cannot gain access to or alter patient records. Original medical records must be released
by the hospital only in accordance with Federal or State laws, court orders, or subpoenas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since proposed &sect;482.43(d) has been in effect as &sect;482.21(b)(2) (beginning September 15, 1986), there
has been no conflict with &sect;482.24(b)(3) and we do not anticipate any problems when &sect;482.43(d) becomes
effective as a final rule. ``Necessary medical information'' has not been interpreted in our guidelines as requiring
transmission of the patient's medical record.

to send to it.

 ``Appropriate facilities'' refers to facilities that can meet the patient's medical needs on a post-discharge basis.
Our interpretive guidelines for &sect;482.21(b)(2) give as examples of ``necessary'' information: functional
capacity of an individual, the nursing and other care requirements of the patient, discharge summary, and referral
forms.

 These are typical overhead costs of Medicare hospital operations that are allocated to the appropriate cost center
and that are already taken into account as part of the cost base used to develop payment rates under the prospective
payment system (PPS). Therefore, the PPS payment rates already reflect these costs and no additional payment by either
Medicare or the beneficiary is needed.

 If the information is governed by &sect;482.24(b)(3), which concerns medical record services, it is subject to the
safeguards of that provision. This provision requires that medical information be released only to authorized individuals
and that the hospital ensure that unauthorized individuals cannot gain access to or alter patient records. Otherwise
the release of the information is governed by any other Federal law, State law or hospital policy, which may require
a patient's written authorization before release of information.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter requested that we define ``appropriate facility'' as one that (a) is able to provide needed care in a
manner that complies with Federal and State standards; (b) participates in payment programs that are needed to pay
for the beneficiary's care; and (c) is within a reasonable distance of the beneficiary's home so that relatives and
friends may visit. Such a definition, the commenter suggested, would establish reasonable guidelines consistent
with current HCFA policies and Congressional intent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``appropriate facility'' has been utilized in present 42 CFR 482.21(b)(2) since September 15, 1986 without
further definition and has not presented an implementation problem. Therefore, we do not believe we need a more specific
definition in this regulation. Our interpretive guidelines for &sect;482.21(b)(2) currently define ``appropriate
facilities'' as facilities that can meet the patient's medical needs on a post-discharge basis. We will consider
the commenter's suggested factors, and others, when drafting implementing guidelines for &sect;482.43(d).

 One commenter thought we should reinforce the requirement in &sect;482.43(e) that a hospital reassess its discharge
planning process on an on-going basis; the reinforcement would be a requirement that a hospital document its discharge
planning process, the procedure and the results of the reassessment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in response to comments on the general opening statement in &sect;482.43, we are requiring that the hospital
have written policies and procedures for its entire discharge planning process, which will include its reassessment.
A specific documentation requirement for &sect;482.43(e) is not needed since it is subsumed by our revision of the
general opening statement in &sect;482.43. We will also reinforce the need for documentation of &sect;482.43(e)
in our interpretive guidelines.

 One commenter believed it would be helpful if the new hospital condition of participation for discharge planning
had built into it measures or parameters for ascertaining when additional discharge planning features and responsibilities
should be added.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although we do not agree that such measures or parameters should be specified in the regulation at this time, or that
they could be all inclusive, we do believe it is appropriate to mention some factors suggested by commenters to the
regulations that will be included in the interpretive guidelines for &sect;482.43(e). The guidelines will include
assuring_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The effectiveness of the identification criteria; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The quality and timeliness for discharge planning evaluations and discharge plans; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That the hospital discharge personnel maintain complete and accurate information on community long-term care
services and facilities and use this information to advise patients and their representatives of appropriate options;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) That the hospital has a coordinated discharge planning process that integrates discharge planning with other
functional departments, including the quality assurance and utilization review activities of the institution,
and involves the various disciplines responsible for patient care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, in reviewing this and other comments, we believe &sect;482.43(e) can be strengthened by clarifying that, although
a review of discharge plans must be part of the reassessment requirement, we are not restricting a hospital to that
mechanism alone. For example, a hospital might wish to review a sample of patients who were not identified as likely
to suffer adverse health consequences upon discharge if there was no adequate discharge planning as a means to reassess
the effectiveness of their identification criteria. This clarification of the regulation will remove an unnecessary
restriction on the means used to accomplish reassessment and increase hospital flexibility in meeting the reassessment
standard. Section 482.43(e) is revised to read:

Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter thought it unfortunate that the two interrelated processes (the development of uniform needs assessment
instruments and discharge planning) have been separated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Although these two statutory provisions both appear in section 9305 of OBRA '86, they are separate provisions (section
9305(c) is the hospital discharge planning process and section 9305(h) is the development of uniform needs assessment
instrument(s)) with different implementation requirements. The legislation does not specify that implementation
of the hospital discharge planning process is contingent upon development of a uniform needs assessment instrument.
Further, implementation of the hospital discharge planning process requires regulations only while section 9305(h)
required the appointment of and public hearings by a Secretary's Advisory Panel on the Development of Uniform Needs
Assessment Instrument(s), which was to send a report to Congress with its recommendations. The 18-member panel completed
its work, and the recommendations were forwarded to Congress in a report on June 30, 1992. The recommendations to Congress
include recognition of the need for field testing and possible further refinement of the uniform needs assessment
instrument before adoption. Certainly, patients have a current need for an expanded discharge planning process
under the hospital conditions of participation and we do not believe an additional delay of this rule would serve a
useful purpose. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter may be assured that, although these are separate statutory provisions with separate implementation
requirements, HCFA has and will continue to coordinate these two activities. The discharge planning process has
been structured so that any future instrument requirements can be incorporated by regulation into the discharge
planning requirements. Similarly, the Advisory Panel drafted the framework of the uniform needs assessment instrument
that they believe is compatible with this rule on discharge planning. It is premature, however, to include a requirement
for usage of the instrument in the condition of participation before the instrument's utility is evaluated through
field testing.

 We believe it is best left to the hospital and physician to handle these disputes within the limits of an applicable
State statute. It would be very difficult for us to draft guidelines that are flexible enough to allow all appropriate
hospital procedures to be approved and, since the Federal interest is in the result rather than the process, we elected
to leave this to hospital discretion.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We received comments from three entities concerning the ``Important Message from Medicare.'' All three thought
the Message to be inadequate for purposes of informing patients of discharge planning. One commenter believed the
Message should have been released at a time that did not preclude public input on the contents of the revised Message
concerning discharge planning. Another commenter thought that patients should, in addition to written notification,
be informed orally of their discharge planning rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The statute does not require notice to patients concerning their right to discharge planning. It does require unconditionally
that the hospital provide the service when needed. Moreover, we do not agree that the Message is inadequate for bringing
discharge planning to the attention of patients or their representatives. Although it does not contain the specifics
of the proposed rule as one commenter recommended, its purpose is to emphasize the availability of discharge planning
and the need to consult one's physician or appropriate hospital staff for assistance. To add more detail would, we
believe, add confusion; the Message is already full of other important information and could become overwhelming.

 There is a need, recognized by Congress, to provide for sufficient flexibility in the requirements for them to be applied
to both small rural facilities and complex urban hospital centers. This approach is also consistent with the focus
of the June 17, 1986 revision of the conditions of participation for hospitals, which eliminated unnecessary regulations
and replaced specific details on maintaining adequate and safe facilities with general comprehensive statements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We will implement this regulation through interpretive guidelines, which are the survey tools used by surveyors
to determine Federal compliance with the regulation. These guidelines will contain a degree of specificity and clarification
that is impractical and unwarranted for inclusion in the Federal regulation.

 Two commenters thought we should adopt the more detailed and strict discharge planning requirements of a particular
State or locality in the regulations at 42 CFR 483.43. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There is nothing in the regulations to prevent a hospital from complying with stricter State or local requirements.
In fact, our regulations at 42 CFR 482.11 would require such compliance. However, we believe that the statutory provision
on discharge planning, because it is so detailed, reflects the level of effort intended by the Congress to be required
by HCFA and so we do not believe it is appropriate to go beyond Federal statutory provisions.

 One commenter believed that the regulations should clearly state that if a patient does not want a discharge evaluation
or plan, his wishes should prevail over the hospital's need to comply with the condition of participation.

Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As with other services offered by hospitals, patients may refuse to accept discharge planning or to comply with a discharge
plan just as they may refuse medical treatment. When a patient exercises this choice, however, we suggest that the
hospitals document the patient's refusal. The interpretive guidelines will mention this type of situation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed the condition of participation for discharge planning needs to reflect more comprehensively
the purposes of discharge planning, among them_ 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) to ensure that patients are not discharged prematurely and to provide evidence on that point; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) to facilitate appropriate outplacement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) to document the need for post-hospital care for purposes of prior concurrent authorization by fiscal intermediaries
to pay for such services; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) to document the need for administratively necessary days; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) to help ensure continuity of cases in a fragmented delivery system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As defined in the legislation, the purpose of the discharge planning process is to ensure a timely and smooth transition
to the most appropriate type and setting for post-hospital or rehabilitative care. The regulations include requirements
to achieve this result. We do not believe a more detailed discussion of its purpose would enhance its effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter believed that we should require that each hospital have an integrated discharge planning process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Assuring that the process is complete and functions properly is a hospital's responsibility. The interpretive guidelines
for &sect;482.43(e) contain procedures for determining a hospital's success in meeting this requirement. We believe
that a separate regulatory requirement for ``coordination'' would be redundant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter thought we should include a requirement that discharge planning be placed within the hospital's social
services department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We do not agree. One of our stated objectives of the revised conditions of participation for hospitals, which became
effective September 15, 1986, was to permit maximum flexibility in hospital administration and they do not contain
a requirement for a social services department into which this requirement could be placed. We will continue to encourage
that flexibility in implementing the discharge planning requirement by not requiring that it be placed in a particular
hospital department.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that there is a need for careful monitoring and vigorous enforcement of the discharge planning
process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We agree. As with the other conditions of participation, the new 42 CFR 482.43 will be monitored through the survey
and certification process. We will be developing detailed guidelines for our hospital surveyors to use in determining
whether the discharge planning process results in the development of appropriate plans; whether the individual
plans are adequate; and whether the plans are appropriately executed as required by this regulation.

V. Summary of Revisions to Proposed Rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are adopting the proposed rule as final with the changes described above. These changes include the following:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 482.43, Introductory paragraph: We are revising this section to specify that the hospital discharge
planning condition of participation applies to all patients, and we are adding a requirement that the hospital must
specify its discharge planning policies and procedures in writing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 482.43 (b)(2) and (c)(1)_We are omitting the phrase ``(consistent with available community and hospital
resources).''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Section 482.43(b)(5)_We are omitting the qualifier, ``, to the greatest extent possible,'' from the requirement
that appropriate arrangements be made before discharge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 482.43(c)(3)_We are requiring the hospital to arrange for the initial implementation of the discharge
plan rather than requiring that a hospital assist in implementing a discharge plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 482.43(c)(4)_We are requiring the hospital to reassess a patient's discharge plan if there are factors
that may affect continuing care needs or the appropriateness of the discharge plan, rather than requiring the proposed
periodic reassessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Section 482.43(e)_We are revising the proposed requirement that a hospital reassess its discharge planning
process by reviewing discharge plans to instead include review of the plans as part of the reassessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, as noted in section III. B of this preamble, we are not adopting the proposed changes in &sect;&sect;405.2135
and 405.2137 to the ESRD conditions for coverage.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1861(e)(3) of the Act requires a hospital participating in Medicare to have by-laws in effect concerning
its staff of physicians. The staff of physicians is also a matter of health and safety for the hospital's patients;
therefore, section 1861(e)(9) of the Act, which gives the Secretary the authority to promulgate health and safety
standards, serves as a basis for governing the appointment of a medical director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among the conditions of participation a hospital participating in Medicare must meet is one at &sect;482.22 concerning
medical staff. One of the standards, concerning medical staff organization and accountability (see &sect;482.22(b)(3)),
requires that the responsibility for the organization and conduct of the medical staff be assigned only to an individual
doctor of medicine or osteopathy. This person is the medical director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 19, 1989, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;239) was enacted.
Section 6025 of that law permits a Medicare-participating hospital the flexibility to consider and assign a doctor
of dental surgery or dental medicine when naming a medical director, if permitted by State law of the State in which
the hospital is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Revision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of section 6025 of OBRA '89, we are revising standard (b)(3), Medical staff organization and accountability,
of &sect;482.22, Condition of participation: Medical staff. We are requiring that the responsibility for organization
and conduct of the medical staff may be assigned only to an individual doctor of medicine or osteopathy, except when
State law of the State in which the hospital is located permits a hospital to have a doctor of dental surgery or dental
medicine as its medical director. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are revising our regulations to conform to the OBRA '89 provision. Doing so will give hospitals flexibility in some
States, eliminate conflicts between State and Federal laws in some instances, and acknowledge changing practices
in the delivery of medical care.

B. Accrediting Program Name Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The name of the entity accrediting programs for x-ray technologists in &sect;405.1413, Conditions for Coverage_qualifications,
orientation and health of technical personnel, paragraph (a)(1), has been changed from ``the Council on Medical
Education'' to ``the Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation.'' We are making the necessary conforming
change to our regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VII. Impact Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)
(5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, we treat all hospitals and ESRD facilities as small
entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not have the data to assess accurately the magnitude of the change in procedures that will result from the new condition
of participation on discharge planning. However, we believe that adequate planning is already done in most hospitals
for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The prospective payment system has created an incentive for hospitals to have good discharge planning procedures;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The conditions of participation have a standard requiring each hospital to do discharge planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of positive evidence to the contrary, we believe that this final rule will have little effect. We wish
to point out, however, that incorporating the statutory requirements as a condition, instead of a standard, could
result in graver consequences for those hospitals that do not engage in adequate planning in the event that a routine
or complaint survey establishes noncompliance. However, we do not expect this to happen often. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If it were correct to presume that a lack of planning leads to systematic underservice of beneficiary needs, then the
requirement for discharge planning, especially early assessment of the need for planning, should: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ensure that needs are identified and appropriate transfers and referrals are made; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Result in some increase in health care utilization by patients who might otherwise not have received needed
care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We do not believe that all patients receive all needed care. However, factors other than the lack of planning affect
whether or not patients receive needed services. Even when planning is available, patients sometimes defer or avoid
recommended referrals or follow-up care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other provisions of this rule will have no significant effect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have determined and the Secretary certifies that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. We have therefore not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final
rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis
must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small
rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are not preparing a rural impact statement since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final
rule will not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of Management
and Budget.

VIII. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 482.43 of this rule contains information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection requirements that are subject to the Office of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management and Budget (OMB) approval under the Paperwork

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reporting burden for the collections of information in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;482.43 is comparable to the burden for &sect;482.21(b), which it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replaces (and which is currently approved under OMB approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number 0938&hyph;0328).

IX. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires us to publish a general notice of proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and afford prior public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on proposed rules. Such notice includes a statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the time, place and nature of rulemaking proceedings, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reference to the legal authority under which the rule is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involved. However, this requirement does not apply when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency finds good cause that such a notice and comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public interest, and incorporates its reasons in the rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issued. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We have in this final rule published our intent to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conform our requirements on medical director qualifications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to those of section 6025 of Public Law 101&hyph;239 and to change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the name of an accrediting program. Since this final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
merely conforms our regulations regarding medical director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualifications to the statute without interpretation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change of name of an accrediting program only amends the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to reflect the new name, we believe it to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary and not in the public interest to publish a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule to obtain public comment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discharge planning. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The hospital must identify at an early 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stage of hospitalization all patients who are likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suffer adverse health consequences upon discharge if there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no adequate discharge planning. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Standard: Discharge planning evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation to the patients identified in paragraph (a) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this section, and to other patients upon the patient's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request, the request of a person acting on the patient's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behalf, or the request of the physician. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A registered nurse, social worker, or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriately qualified personnel must develop, or supervise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the development of, the evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of the likelihood of a patient needing post- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital services and of the availability of the services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The discharge planning evaluation must include an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of the likelihood of a patient's capacity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
self-care or of the possibility of the patient being cared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for in the environment from which he or she entered the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The hospital personnel must complete the evaluation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a timely basis so that appropriate arrangements for post-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hospital care are made before discharge, and to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary delays in discharge.

appropriately qualified personnel must develop, or supervise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the development of, a discharge plan if the discharge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning evaluation indicates a need for a discharge plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the absence of a finding by the hospital that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
patient needs a discharge plan, the patient's physician may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request a discharge plan. In such a case, the hospital must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop a discharge plan for the patient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The hospital must arrange for the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the patient's discharge plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan if there are factors that may affect continuing care 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs or the appropriateness of the discharge plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) As needed, the patient and family members or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested persons must be counseled to prepare 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the September 1, 1994 issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 45330), we published a final rule with comment period revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective
payment systems for operating costs and capital-related costs to implement necessary changes arising from our continuing
experience with the system. In the addendum to that final rule with comment period, we announced the prospective payment
rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs applicable to discharges
occurring on or after October 1, 1994, and set forth update factors for the rate-of-increase limits for hospitals
and hospital units excluded from the prospective payment systems. This notice corrects errors made in that document.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the September 1, 1994 final rule with comment period (59 FR 45330), we indicated that if a hospital believes its wage
index value is incorrect as a result of an intermediary or HCFA error, the hospital must notify HCFA no later than September
23, 1994. As a result of this process, we have identified several corrections to the wage data. Accordingly, the wage
index values for several areas have been changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule also contained other technical and typographical errors. The revised wage index values, and other
changes affecting prospective payment rates, reflect corrections that were made between publication of the FY 1995
prospective payment system final rule with comment period on September 1, 1994, and implementation of the FY 1995
prospective payment rates on October 1, 1994. Therefore, we are making the following corrections to the September
1, 1994 final rule with comment period:

Any request for reconsideration must be based upon knowledge of changed conditions, or upon new scientific or technical
data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications are made pursuant to section 201 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and
are in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq., and with 44 CFR part 65. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For rating purposes, the currently effective community number is shown and must be used for all new policies and renewals.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The modified base (100-year) flood elevations are the basis for the floodplain management measures that the community
is required to either adopt or to show evidence of being already in effect in order to qualify or to remain qualified
for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These modified elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum
that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must change any existing ordinances that
are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community may at any time enact stricter requirements
of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state or regional entities.

are available for inspection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The modifications are made pursuant to section 206 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4105, and

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This order revokes an Executive order insofar as it affects 15 acres of public land withdrawn for the Bureau of Land
Management's Phosphate Reserve No. 7. The land is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was withdrawn. The revocation

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission modifies its rules pertaining to three aspects of auction design for the broadband PCS auctions: Procedures
triggering the close of an auction, timing of the auctions for the entrepreneurs' blocks, and anti-collusion rules.
These actions are intended to speed the conclusion of the auctions, thus facilitating rapid introduction of service
to the public; to improve the administrative efficiency of the auction process; and to foster competition and widespread
participation in the auctions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. By this action, we reconsider, on our own motion, decisions made in the Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order in this
proceeding, which addressed petitions for reconsideration of the Fifth Report and Order concerning auction design
and procedures for the auction of licenses to provide personal communications services in the 2 GHz band (``broadband
PCS'').
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 In light of our experience in the national and regional narrowband PCS license auctions, we find it desirable to modify
our rules pertaining to three aspects of auction design for the broadband PCS auctions: procedures triggering the
close of an auction, timing of the auctions for the entrepreneurs' blocks, and anti-collusion rules.

II. Stopping Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. In the Fifth Report and Order we stated that a simultaneous multiple round auction with a simultaneous stopping
rule will close when a single round has passed in which there is no new acceptable bid on any license and no activity rule
waiver is submitted.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In the Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order we allowed for two types of activity rule waivers, ``proactive'' waivers,
which will keep an auction open in a round in which no new valid bids are submitted, and ``automatic'' waivers, which
will not keep an auction open.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 We also reaffirmed our decision to use a simultaneous stopping rule, which holds bidding open on all licenses until
no new acceptable bid is offered on any license.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 These same rules were applied in the regional and national narrowband auctions. The nationwide narrowband PCS auction
(with 10 licenses) was completed after 47 rounds of bidding, and the regional narrowband PCS auction (with 30 licenses)
took 105 rounds to complete. In the broadband PCS auctions 99 MTA licenses will be auctioned in the first auction and
a total of 1,972 BTA licenses in subsequent auctions. Although the number of rounds to complete a simultaneous multiple
round auction is not necessarily directly proportional to the number of licenses put up for bid, we are concerned that,
without changes in procedures, it may take an excessively long period of time to conduct these auctions, thus creating
a significant delay in providing service to the public.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 Thus our recent experience with simultaneous multiple round auctions suggests that the Commission should consider
additional measures to ensure that future auctions are completed within a reasonable period of time.

3. We believe that retaining the discretion to keep an auction open even if no new acceptable bids and no proactive waivers
are submitted will allow the Commission to complete the broadband PCS auctions in a timely manner without sacrificing
efficiency or revenue. Providing the auction staff with the discretion to keep an auction open will permit the Commission
to use larger minimum bid increments early in the auction (to move the auction along quickly) without incurring the
risk that the auction will close while some bidders are willing to pay significantly more for certain licenses than
the current high bid but not more than the relatively large minimum bid increments. The Commission will be able to permit
additional bidding at lower bid increments subsequent to a round with no bids, thereby increasing the likelihood
that licenses will be awarded to the bidders that value them most highly and facilitating efficient aggregations
of licenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Retaining the discretion to keep an auction open will also allow the Commission to continue to accept bids on a license
for which a bid was withdrawn late in an auction, especially in the last round of an auction. Without the option of keeping
an auction open, a license for which a bid was withdrawn in the last round would have to be put up for bid in a subsequent
auction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Accordingly, we retain the discretion to keep an auction open even if no new acceptable bids and no proactive waivers
are submitted in a single round. Under this minor modification of our procedures, the Commission would in essence
have the ability to submit its own proactive waiver, thus keeping the auction open. This rule modification will facilitate
the rapid completion of future auctions because it will permit the Commission to use larger bid increments, which
speed the pace of the auction, without risking a premature auction close.

6. In the Fifth Report and Order, the Commission chose to divide broadband PCS licenses into three groups and to hold
a simultaneous multiple round auction for the licenses in each group. The license group to be auctioned first consisted
of blocks A and B, each with 30 MHz of spectrum and MTA geographic scope. The next group consisted of blocks C and F (the
entrepreneurs' blocks), which have been reserved for bidding by smaller entrepreneurial firms. The group to be auctioned
last consisted of blocks D and E, with 10 MHz of spectrum each and BTA geographic scope.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 We concluded that in order to promote efficient license allocation, highly interdependent licenses should be grouped
together and put up for bid at the same time in a multiple round auction. Doing so, we concluded, would provide bidders
information about the prices of complementary and substitutable licenses while such licenses were still up for bid,
and thus would facilitate awarding licenses to the bidders who value them most highly. Nevertheless, we noted that
the cost and complexity of auctioning a very large number of interdependent licenses simultaneously might outweigh
the informational and bidding flexibility advantages.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 In the Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order we reaffirmed our decision concerning the sequence of auctions.

7. We now believe that we may wish to hold two separate auctions for the C and F block licenses.
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 In light of our experience with the narrowband auctions, we are concerned that auctioning simultaneously the 986
licenses in the two entrepreneurs' blocks may create excessive administrative complexity for the Commission and
for bidders, particularly when neither will have had experience with more than 99 licenses in a single auction. In
addition, we have found that as we gain experience with license auctions we identify certain modifications that are
necessary to improve the efficiency and administration of the auction process. We may wish to benefit from such experience
in administering the highly complex designated entity provisions that apply to competitive bidding for licenses
on the C and F blocks. Further, it appears now that few, if any, potential applicants have any interest in aggregating
block C and block F licenses, so that the interdependence between license values in the two blocks may be less than we
initially believed. Consequently, we reserve the discretion to hold two separate simultaneous multiple round auctions
for the entrepreneurs' block licenses, one auction for block C and one for block F. We will announce by Public Notice
in advance of the application deadline whether one or two entrepreneurs' block auctions will be held and the date of
those auctions.

8. We have become aware of some confusion regarding the definition of the terms ``applicant'' and ``bidder'' as they
are used in our anti-collusion rules, and we wish to clarify our rules on this issue.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Section 1.2105(c)(1) of the Commission's Rules prohibits ``bidders'' from cooperating, collaborating, discussing
or disclosing in any manner the substance of their bids or bidding strategies, but &sect;1.2105(c)(2) and (3) provide
exceptions to this rule so as to allow ``applicants'' to make changes in ownership that do not result in a change in control
of the applicant, or to bid jointly with other applicants, as long as they have not applied for licenses in any of the
same geographic license areas.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Though we intended the terms ``bidder'' and ``applicant'' to be used interchangeably, we now recognize that it would
be less confusing simply to use the term ``applicant,'' and we are amending the rules accordingly.

9. In addition, it has been suggested that &sect;1.2105(c)(1) of our rules should be interpreted to mean that parties
holding attributable interests in bidders are not prohibited from engaging in the discussions addressed in that
section.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 We wish to make clear that this interpretation is an incorrect reading of our rules. For purposes of our anti-collusion
rules, therefore, we clarify that the term ``applicant'' will include all holders of attributable interests in an
applicant. For this purpose, ``attributable interest'' shall have the same definition as that used in &sect;24.204(d)(2)(i)
of our Rules for purposes of defining interests subject to the spectrum aggregation limits: ``[p]artnership and
other ownership interests and any stock interest amounting to 5 percent of more of the equity, or outstanding stock,
or outstanding voting stock of a broadband PCS licensee or applicant will be attributable.''
<FOOTCITE>13</FOOTCITE>
 In addition ``[o]fficers and directors of a broadband PCS licensee or applicant *&blank;*&blank;* shall be considered
to have an attributable interest in the entity with which they are so associated.''
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 This is entirely consistent with the intent of the anti-collusion rules. Indeed, if holders of attributable interests
were not considered applicants, collusive arrangements would be possible simply through the creation of a separate
entity to act as the ``applicant.'' Further, this clarification conforms with other Commission rules regarding
the competitive bidding process. For example, &sect;24.813(a) requires parties applying to participate in broadband
PCS auctions to provide, among other things, information with respect to ``any person holding five percent or more
of each class of stock, warrants, options or debt securities *&blank;*&blank;*.''

10. We believe, however, that allowing holders of non-controlling attributable interests in an applicant greater
flexibility to form agreements with other applicants may enable applicants to acquire the capital necessary to bid
successfully for licenses. Our anti-collusion rules are intended to protect the integrity and robustness of our
competitive bidding process. In pursuit of that goal, however, we do not wish to restrict unreasonably the formation
of non-collusive bidding consortia. For example, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
we added to our Rules &sect;24.833, which provides that parties that after the auction hold non-controlling ownership
interests in more PCS spectrum than a single entity is entitled to hold may divest sufficient properties to come into
compliance with the spectrum aggregation limits.
<FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>
 Section 24.833 clearly contemplates entities holding ownership interests in two applicants for licenses in the
same markets. Nevertheless, when one entity holds an attributable interest in more than one applicant for licenses
in the same geographic license area, the potential for collusion is present because of the opportunity for the common
owner to influence the bidding of the applicants. Thus, our rules permit applicants to change their ownership, enter
into joint bidding arrangements and form consortia after the filing of short-form applications only if the parties
to such arrangements have not applied for licenses in any of the same geographic areas.

11. We believe that so long as collusive conduct can be reliably prevented, the public interest favors allowing holders
of non-controlling attributable interests in one applicant for a particular license to obtain ownership interests
in or enter into consortium arrangements with a second applicant for licenses in the same geographic area(s). Accordingly,
we will amend the anti-collusion rules to permit a holder of non-controlling attributable interests in an applicant
to obtain an ownership interest in or enter into a consortium arrangement with another applicant for a license in the
same geographic area, provided that the attributable interest holder certifies to the Commission that it has observed
and will observe certain restrictions on communication concerning the applicants in which it holds an attributable
interest or with which it has entered into a consortium arrangement. The attributable interest holder must certify
that it has not communicated and will not communicate, with the applicant or anyone else, concerning the bids or bidding
strategies (including which licenses an applicant will or will not bid on) of more than one applicant for licenses
in the same geographic area in which it holds an ownership interest or with which it has a consortium arrangement. As
described above, ``applicant'' for this purpose includes all holders of attributable interests in an applicant.
Thus, if the attributable interest holder has discussed the bidding strategy of the applicant in which it holds an
attributable interest (Company A), or of any other entity that also holds an attributable interest in Company A, the
attributable interest holder may not acquire an attributable interest in another applicant for a license in a geographic
area in which Company A (or any other attributable interest holder in Company A) has applied for a license unless it
certifies that it has not communicated concerning the bids or bidding strategies of the applicant in which it wishes
to acquire an attributable interest.

12. We believe that this revision will facilitate the flow of capital to applicants by enabling parties to make investments
in multiple applicants for licenses in the same geographic license areas while ensuring that these investments will
not lead to collusion among bidders. We recognize that some potential for collusion exists whenever an entity is permitted
to hold an interest in more than one applicant for licenses in the same geographic license area. We expect that the certification
requirement will adequately prevent collusion from occurring. However, we intend to scrutinize carefully any instances
in which bidding patterns suggest that collusion may be occurring, and we wish to emphasize that all applicants and
their owners continue to be subject to existing antitrust laws. Applicants should note that conduct that is permissible
under the Commission's Rules may be prohibited by the antitrust laws.
<FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, applicants should proceed with extreme caution in situations involving consortia and joint bidding arrangements.
We also wish to make clear that communications concerning bids and bidding strategies may include communications
regarding capital calls or requests for additional funds in support of bids or bidding strategies to the extent such
communications convey information concerning the bids and bidding strategies directly or indirectly. If applicants
enter into new or modified consortia or bidding arrangements, or if changes are made in an applicant's ownership,
the applicants must timely modify their short-form applications to reflect these changes.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), we conclude that ``good cause'' exists to have the rule changes take effect immediately
because a delay would not provide applicants with sufficient time to finalize their bidding strategies and business
plans for the upcoming broadband PCS auctions. Immediate implementation of the rule changes set forth herein also
provides applicants with the required certainty to proceed with their bidding and business strategies, alleviating
concerns that last-minute modifications to our rules would impede the success of their auction plan. See 5 U.S.C.

(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section, after the filing of short-form applications,
all applicants are prohibited from cooperating, collaborating, discussing or disclosing in any manner the substance
of their bids or bidding strategies, or discussing or negotiating settlement agreements, with other applicants
until after the high bidder makes the required down payment, unless such applicants are members of a bidding consortium
or other joint bidding arrangement identified on the bidder's short-form application pursuant to &sect;1.2105(a)(2)(viii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Applicants may modify their short-form applications to reflect formation of consortia or changes in ownership
at any time before or during an auction, provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant,
and provided that the parties forming consortia or entering into ownership agreements have not applied for licenses
in any of the same geographic license areas. Such changes will not be considered major modifications of the application.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) After the filing of short-form applications, applicants may make agreements to bid jointly for licenses, provided
the parties to the agreement have not applied for licenses in any of the same geographic license areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) After the filing of short-form applications, a holder of a non-controlling attributable interest in an entity
submitting a short-form application may acquire an ownership interest in, form a consortium with, or enter into a
joint bidding arrangement with, other applicants for licenses in the same geographic license area, provided that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The attributable interest holder certifies to the Commission that it has not communicated and will not communicate
with any party concerning the bids or bidding strategies of more than one of the applicants in which it holds an attributable
interest, or with which it has a consortium or joint bidding arrangement, and which have applied for licenses in the
same geographic license area(s); and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The arrangements do not result in any change in control of an applicant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Applicants must modify their short-form applications to reflect any changes in ownership or in the membership
of consortia or joint bidding arrangements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) For purposes of this paragraph:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The term ``applicant'' shall include the entity submitting a short-form application to participate in an auction
(FCC Form 175), as well as all holders of partnership and other ownership interests and any stock interest amounting
to 5 percent or more of the entity, or outstanding stock, or outstanding voting stock of the entity submitting a short-form
application, and all officers and directors of that entity; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title 49 U.S.C. 10118 and 10120 provide the Secretary of Transportation with authority to exempt a manufacturer from
any responsibility to notify or to remedy any defect or failure to comply upon a determination that such defect or failure
to comply is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This authority has been delegated to the Administrator
of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) as part of the Secretary's general delegation to administer
the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (49 CFR 1.50). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations implementing 49 U.S.C. 10118 and 10120 (at that time 15 U.S.C. 1417) were issued in 1977: 49 CFR part 556

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Exemption for Inconsequential Defect or Noncompliance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. NHTSA Order 800&hyph;2 (November 20, 1978) established the agency's ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Procedures for Processing Petitions for Inconsequential Defect or Noncompliance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
'', and assigned the Office of Rulemaking the primary responsibility for processing inconsequentiality petitions.
Part 566 is silent as to signatory authority for inconsequential notices. Under Order 800&hyph;2, ``the Decision
Package is submitted to the Administrator for approval and signature.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In practice, determinations of grant or denial have been signed by the Associate Administrator for Rulemaking after
approval by the Administrator. Thus, notwithstanding any formal delegation of power, the Administrator has made
a de facto delegation of such power. The agency is now amending Part 501 to make a de jure delegation of this power. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Forty-nine U.S.C. 10118 and 10120 are silent on whether a determination may be appealed. However, 49 CFR 556.7 expressly
permits any interested person to do so, and, under 49 CFR 556.8, ``the Administrator'' may grant or deny such appeals.
In practice, the same procedure has been followed with respect to the infrequent appeals from inconsequentiality
determinations. Because appeals are generally made to a higher authority than the decision maker, the Administrator
has decided to reserve this power, and Part 501 is amended to reflect this decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, NHTSA has noted that the titles of two Associate Administrators as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations
lack the underlining accorded the other Associate Administrators in 49 CFR 501.8. NHTSA is amending these sections
to add the underlining for consistency of treatment.

This rulemaking has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined that the rulemaking is not
significant under Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. The purpose of the rule is to
clarify existing agency policy and procedures. Since the rule does not have any significant cost or other impacts,
preparation of a full regulatory evaluation is not warranted.

This final rule does not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103 whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety
standard is in effect, a state may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance
which is not identical to the Federal standard. Section 30161 of Title 49 sets forth a procedure for judicial review
of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That section does not
require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file
suit in court.

I. Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ``Anti Car Theft Act of 1992'' (ACTA) amended the law relating to the labelling of major parts on high theft and other
motor vehicles that is now codified as 49 U.S.C. chapter 331 Theft Prevention. At 49 U.S.C. 33101(10), ``passenger
motor vehicle'' is defined to include ``a multipurpose passenger vehicle or light duty truck when that vehicle or
truck is rated at not more than 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.'' Since ``passenger motor vehicle'' was previously
defined to include passenger cars only, the effect of ACTA is that certain multipurpose passenger vehicle (MPV) and
light-duty truck (LDT) lines may be determined to be high theft vehicles, subject to the Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention
Standard (49 CFR part 541). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the Theft Prevention Standard is to reduce the incidence of motor vehicle theft by facilitating the
tracing and recovery of parts from stolen vehicles. The standard seeks to facilitate such tracing by requiring that
vehicle identification numbers (VINs), VIN derivative numbers, or other symbols be placed on major motor vehicle
parts. Each vehicle in a high theft line must have its major parts and major replacement parts marked unless the line
is exempted from parts marking pursuant to 49 CFR part 543. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To conform the Theft Prevention Standard to ACTA, NHTSA issued on July 7, 1993, an advance notice of proposed rulemaking
(ANPRM) (58 FR 36376). NHTSA sought comments on definitions of multipurpose passenger vehicles (MPVs) and light-duty
trucks (LDTs) for the Theft Prevention Standard, and on which parts of these vehicles should be considered major parts
and therefore subject to parts marking. After considering the public comments on the ANPRM, NHTSA published a notice
of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on July 8, 1994 (59 FR 35082), to amend the Theft Prevention Standard. The issues that
were raised in the NPRM, and the public comments addressing them are discussed below.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Definitions of ``Light Duty Truck'' and ``Multipurpose Passenger Vehicle'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA noted that since the statutory requirements for ``multipurpose passenger vehicles'' differ from
those for ``light duty trucks,'' these two terms must be clearly defined to make it possible to determine whether a
particular vehicle is an MPV or an LDT. Under ACTA, since NHTSA must require some MPV's with below-median theft rates
to be marked, but the Act exempts LDTs with below-median theft rates from coverage, NHTSA must ensure that a distinction
between LDTs and MPVs is made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ACTA limits ``multipurpose passenger vehicles'' to those vehicles rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or
less. Thus, NHTSA's proposed definition of ``multipurpose passenger vehicle'' was:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
ACTA does not define ``light-duty truck,'' and ACTA's legislative history provided no guidance as to which vehicles
to include in a ``light-duty truck'' definition for theft prevention purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to base its definition of ``light-duty truck'' for Theft Prevention Standard purposes
on NHTSA's definition of ``truck'' at 49 CFR 571.3: ``a motor vehicle with motive power, except a trailer, designed
primarily for the transportation of property or special purpose equipment.'' After taking into account ACTA's 6,000
pound gross vehicle weight rating limitation, NHTSA proposed to define ``light-duty truck'' as: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A motor vehicle with motive power, except a trailer, designed primarily for the transportation of property or special
purpose equipment, that is rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or less. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Specifying ``Major Parts'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA also sought public comments on major parts for MPVs and LDTs. 49 U.S.C. 33101(6)(A) through (K) specifies parts
that are ``major parts.'' Under section 33101(6)(L), NHTSA has authority to specify as ``major parts'' other parts
that it specifies are ``comparable in design or function to any of the parts listed.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At 49 CFR 541.5, NHTSA has specified the major parts on high theft passenger car lines that must be marked. With a few
exceptions, &sect;541.5 lists all major parts specified in 49 U.S.C. 33101(6). The agency did not use its authority
to add additional parts to the list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After passage of ACTA, there is no longer a statutory limit on the number of parts per vehicle that may be marked. However,
the costs of marking a vehicle may not exceed $15 (in 1984 dollars). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In discussing the proposal for marking major parts for LDTs and/or MPVs, NHTSA applied the same criteria used to select
the current 14 major parts specified in the Theft Prevention Standard at &sect;541.5(a). The selection criteria
are whether the parts are among those most frequently repaired or most costly to replace. (See 50

FR 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
19728, at 19732; May 10, 1985.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Relying on public comments in response to the ANPRM, NHTSA proposed that parts listed in the Theft Prevention Standard
at &sect;541.5(a)(1) through (11) should, if present on a vehicle, be treated as major parts for MPVs and LDTs also.
Since the 11 parts listed are among the most frequently repaired and costly to replace, NHTSA tentatively found that
the parts, if present on MPVs and LDTs, should be major parts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA also proposed to designate additional parts as major parts for MPVs and LDTs. Although right and
left rear quarter panels (designated as major parts in 49 CFR 541.5(a)(12) and (13)), are not necessarily present
on MPVs or LDTs, NHTSA proposed that for MPVs, in lieu of quarter panels, side-panels should be designated as major
parts, and for LDTs, pickup boxes or cargo boxes should be designated as major parts. NHTSA stated its belief that the
side panels and pickup or cargo boxes are among the parts most frequently repaired. NHTSA also proposed to include
cargo doors on an LDT or MPV, as major parts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Motor Vehicle Glazing as ``Major Parts'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the ANPRM, certain commenters recommended that windows and other pieces of motor vehicle glazing be
specified as major parts for all high theft vehicles. One company, Prospective Technologies, cited the relative
ease with which vehicle glazing could be marked, and the low cost of marking (which Prospective estimated to be $5.00
per vehicle). Prospective also cited Nissan's success in lowering theft rates of the Nissan 300ZX by as much as 26 per
cent after the windows of all 300ZX models were etched with the vehicle identification number beginning in model year
1992.

Based in part on this favorable information, NHTSA proposed to specify marking of passenger motor vehicle parts.
NHTSA tentatively agreed that specifying pieces of glazing as major parts to be marked pursuant to the Theft Prevention
Standard would further the statutory purpose. Since the markings on glazing would be in plain view, all types of motor
vehicle theft, not just theft for the purposes of chop shop operations or other trafficking in stolen motor vehicle
parts, might be deterred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA sought comment whether lower theft rates would result if only some glazing parts were specified for marking
and if so, which parts could be excluded. NHTSA also sought comment on three additional issues arising from the proposal
to require marking of glazing parts.

4. Parts Marking for Non-High Theft Lines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
49 U.S.C. 33103 requires NHTSA, by October 25, 1994, to promulgate a parts marking standard applicable to major parts
installed by manufacturers of ``passenger motor vehicles (other than light duty trucks) in not to exceed one-half
of the lines not designated under section 33104 as high theft lines.'' In carrying out section 33103, NHTSA began by
reviewing theft rates of the 231 vehicle lines that were listed in the 1990/91 theft data. (See 59 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
FR 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12400, March 16, 1994) A total of 116 vehicle lines (any line rated at number 116 or lower) was in the eligible pool of
lines potentially subject to parts marking pursuant to section 33103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the statutory mandate, NHTSA removed all light duty truck lines from the eligible pool. Section 33103(a)
further directs NHTSA to select only lines ``not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines.''
Thus, NHTSA removed any passenger motor vehicle line that NHTSA had previously determined to be high theft. NHTSA
tentatively applied the definition of ``light duty truck'' proposed in the NPRM, and stated it would make appropriate
changes if a different definition were adopted in the final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After removing the ineligible lines, NHTSA determined that there were 57 below-median lines still eligible for selection
under section 33103. Out of the 57 below-median lines left, NHTSA designated the 28 lines with the highest theft rates
to be marked pursuant to section 33103. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA proposed to list each of the selected lines in appendix B to part 541. Pursuant to section 33103, NHTSA proposed
that parts marking for these below-median lines begin with MY 1996, the first model year that begins at least six months
after October 1994. Since section 33103 did not specify marking of replacement parts for below-median lines, NHTSA
did not propose to require marking for replacement parts.

III. Public Comments on the NPRM 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the NPRM, NHTSA received comments from 15 commenters: Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates),
the American Automobile Manufacturers' Association (AAMA), Automark, Chrysler, Ford, Honda, General Motors (GM),
the International Association of Auto Theft Investigators (IAATI), Isuzu, the National Automobile Dealers Association
(NADA), Nissan, Prospective Technologies, Toyota, and Volkswagen. The commenters discussed the issues raised
in the NPRM as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Definitions of ``Light Duty Truck'' and ``Multipurpose Passenger Vehicle'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA received five comments on the definition of ``light duty truck'' (LDT). Four commenters stated that NHTSA's
proposed definition of LDT was consistent with the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992, and should not be changed. Advocates
for Highway and Auto Safety, on the other hand, stated that since ACTA was intended to expand the number and types of
vehicles subject to parts marking, the LDT definition should be ``drawn as narrowly as reasonable under the circumstances.''
Advocates recommended that LDTs be defined as those vehicles: ``built and intended for use exclusively for the transportation
of property or special purpose equipment.'' Thus, Advocates appears to urge that LDT be defined to make as many low
theft vehicle lines as possible subject to parts marking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the agency's view, this outcome would be inconsistent with Congress's action in exempting low-theft LDTs from
the requirement. Moreover, after reviewing the 1990/91 final theft data for LDT lines, NHTSA found few LDT lines with
below-median theft rates. If NHTSA included all below-median LDT lines, only four additional vehicle lines (the
Nissan, Toyota, Isuzu, and Ford Ranger pick ups) would be added to the 28 lines that were proposed for inclusion in appendix
B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, since Advocates' definition would result in vehicles being classified as MPVs for theft purposes that
are classified as trucks for vehicle identification number (VIN) purposes under the vehicle safety standards, adopting
Advocates' definition of LDT would make it difficult for NHTSA to track and monitor the theft history of these LDT lines
through the use of VINs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since there were no other comments addressing the definition of LDT, this final rule adopts the definition of ``light-duty
truck'' proposed in the NPRM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since only Ford addressed the definition of ``multipurpose passenger vehicle'' and it concurred with the definition
discussed in the NPRM, NHTSA is adopting the NPRM's definition of ``multipurpose passenger vehicle.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Specifying ``Major Parts'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters suggested specifying additional parts as ``major parts.'' Advocates recommended the addition of
airbag modules. IAATI recommended that for LDTs and MPVs, the vehicle frame and radiator support assemblies be added.
NHTSA will not adopt these recommendations because it does not determine that at present, airbag modules, frames,
and radiator support assemblies are among those parts most frequently repaired or most costly to replace, the criteria
NHTSA has used to determine whether a part should be specified a ``major part.'' However, since air bags will be mandatory
for all passenger motor vehicles by model year 1999, the determination for airbag modules may be changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Toyota stated that no additional parts should be specified until there are ``positive results'' from a Justice Department
study on the efficacy of parts marking. This study is mandated at 49 U.S.C. 33103(d). NHTSA is not adopting Toyota's
recommendation because the Justice Department's findings are not due until December 1999. The ACTA directs NHTSA,
well before 1999, to extend coverage of the parts marking requirements of the Theft Prevention Standard to LDTs and
MPVs. In order to effectively extend parts marking requirements to LDTs and MPVs, NHTSA must specify parts unique
to LDTS or MPVs that must be marked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For these reasons, NHTSA adopts as final the following as major parts for passenger cars, LDTs, and MPVs: engine, transmission,
right and left front fenders, hood, right and left front doors, right and left rear doors, sliding or cargo door(s),
front and rear bumpers, and the rear door (both doors in case of double doors), decklid, tailgate, or hatchback (whichever
is present). In addition, for passenger cars, the right and rear quarter panels are major parts. For MPVs, the right-side
and left-side assemblies are major parts. For LDTs, the pickup box, and/or cargo box are major parts.

3. Marking of Motor Vehicle Glazing Parts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although NHTSA proposed specifying vehicle glazing parts as major parts, the final rule does not specify any vehicle
glazing parts as major parts. Except for the Advocates and IAATI, all other commenters opposed specifying glazing
parts as major parts, and thus making glazing subject to parts marking. Among the reasons cited was that NHTSA does
not have authority to require marking of parts that are not among the ``major parts'' specified in 49 U.S.C. 33101(6)
(A) through (K), or are (under (L)) ``comparable in design or function to any of the parts listed in subparagraphs (A)
through (K).''

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While NHTSA believes the statute gives the agency ample discretion to determine that glazing parts are ``major parts,''
it has concluded that the cost of such marking would make the cost per vehicle of marking parts likely to exceed the statutory
maximum. An important rationale for NHTSA's proposal in the NPRM to require marking of glazing parts was that it perceived
the cost of marking glazing as relatively low, when considering the lower theft rates shown in certain vehicles with
marked glazing. 49 U.S.C. 33105(a) limits the per vehicle cost of parts marking to $15 (in 1984 dollars). In 1993 dollars,
the per vehicle costs of marking may not exceed $20.86 (see 59 FR 8021, February 17, 1994). Since the experience of Prospective
Technologies appeared to show that marking of glazing would cost about $5.00 per vehicle, NHTSA believed that even
if it specified marking of glazing parts, the per vehicle cost of marking would not exceed $20.86. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The public comments, however, questioned whether marking of glazing could be done for as little as $5.00 per vehicle.
GM noted that marking glazing would add approximately $6.25 to the cost of marking each GM vehicle, ``nearly doubling''
the per vehicle costs of parts marking. GM further noted that the $6.25 costs do not include items such as accidental
glass breakage or glass replacement due to inadvertent VIN error, or the costs of stencil cutter maintenance or stencil
cutter replacement. Although Toyota did not provide specific dollar figures, it stated the $5.00 per vehicle cost
of marking glazing was not feasible, and that ``it is certain'' that the cost increase to mark Toyota lines would be
more than $15.00. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nissan, the company which manufactures the Nissan 300ZX, whose windows were marked by Prospective Technologies,
estimated that the current costs of marking vehicle parts (not including glazing) is between $14 to $20. In contrast
to Prospective's figure of $5.00 per vehicle, Nissan estimated that the present cost of marking glazing on its 300ZX
line (at the port of entry, and using a chemical treatment process) is $25.00 per vehicle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Volkswagen stated that the 1990 cost of marking a Volkswagen vehicle was 25.02 Deutsche marks, or approximately $15.77,
to label all parts, except for the engine and transmission. NHTSA notes that if the cost of inflation since 1990, the
cost of marking the engine and transmission, and (using Prospective Technologies' figure of $5.00 per vehicle) the
cost to mark glazing were all added to the $15.77 figure, Volkswagen's cost of marking a vehicle would exceed the $20.86
limit specified in section 33105(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the public comments received, NHTSA believes specifying glazing parts as major parts, may make the costs
of parts marking for some manufacturers exceed the $20.86 limit specified in section 33105(a). Additionally, Ford
noted that windows are rarely stolen as replacement parts. NADA stated there is no evidence in the record suggesting
that vehicles are stolen for their glazing materials. Thus, in this final rule, NHTSA is not specifying any glazing
as a ``major part'' under 49 CFR 541.5(a).

4. Parts Marking of Non-High-Theft Lines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Ford disagreed with the agency over how to distribute vehicle lines between appendix A (high-theft lines) and the
new appendix B (non-high-theft lines that must now be marked). In Ford's view, appendix B should include up to half
of the vehicle lines that fall below the median, regardless of whether such lines had previously been listed in appendix
A. The agency had proposed to exclude from appendix B any below-median vehicle line that had been previously listed
in appendix A, and to base appendix B on up to half of the remaining below-median vehicle lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Ford's proposed method, up to 54 car lines would be listed in appendix B, but many of these would be lines already
included in appendix A and therefore already required to have their parts marked. Under the agency's method, 28 vehicle
lines were proposed to be listed in appendix B, none of which had previously had their parts marked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering Ford's comment, NHTSA has concluded that the agency's proposed method carries out ACTA's purpose
more faithfully than does Ford's method. As codified, section 33103(a) directs the marking of parts on ``not more
than 50 percent of the lines not designated under section 33104 of this title as high theft lines.'' Section 33104,
in turn, states that vehicle lines that were subject to marking under the pre-ACTA law (i.e., the lines listed in appendix
A) continue to be subject to the requirements of the section. Read together, the provisions support the agency's view
that vehicle lines previously listed in appendix A should continue to be listed in that appendix and not in appendix
B. The agency has adopted the procedure as proposed and has determined the vehicle lines in appendix B accordingly.
However, Ford's comments have caused NHTSA to reexamine the lines it proposed for inclusion in appendix B. The agency
found 6 vehicle lines placed in the bottom quartile of the 1990/91 final theft data. The 6 lines, the Ford Aerostar and
Explorer, the General Motors Oldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser, the Volvo 240 and 940, and the Volkswagen Audi 80/90, will
be removed from appendix B. NHTSA will also remove the Daihatsu Rocky MPV from appendix B, since the Rocky is no longer
sold in the United States. The final rule lists the 21 remaining vehicle lines.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the foregoing, NHTSA proposed to include a definition of ``1990/91 median theft rate.'' Based on 231
vehicle lines, the 1990/91 median theft rate was 3.5826 thefts per thousand vehicles produced. Since NHTSA received
no comments on ``1990/91 median theft rate,'' it is adopting the definition proposed in the NPRM.

Procedure for Selecting Lines to be Covered by the Theft Prevention Standard, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA proposed to apply the 1990/91 median theft rate to passenger motor vehicle lines to be introduced for model year
(MY) 1996 and thereafter. However, as explained below, since this final rule does not begin to apply to affected vehicle
lines until MY 1997, NHTSA will continue to apply the 1983/84 median theft rate to passenger car lines introduced before
MY 1997.

IV. Effective Date 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that the changes described in the NPRM, if made final, would take effect beginning with
model year 1996. With the possible exception of Honda, all commenters requested a longer leadtime than the April 25,
1995 proposed in the NPRM. The longer leadtimes requested ranged from a year after publication of the final rule (Mazda
and Nissan) to September 1, 1996, almost two years after publication of the final rule (Chrysler and General Motors).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As reasons for requesting the longer leadtime, the commenters stated that extra time was needed to buy new equipment
or to change manufacturing processes. In particular, Chrysler stated that production of its ``pull-ahead'' MY 1996
Chrysler Town and Country MPVs (already selected by NHTSA as a high theft line) will begin in January 1995, only two
months after publication of the final rule. Since the changes prescribed in this final rule take effect ``at least
6 months after the date the standard is prescribed'' (49 U.S.C. 33103(e)), if the final rule were to take effect on April
25, 1995, NHTSA could not require marking of the Town and Country line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided the new parts marking procedures for LDTs, MPVs, and vehicle lines
listed in appendix B will take effect with MY 1997. NHTSA decided the extra lead time is necessary because manufacturers
are being required to mark new vehicle types (MPVs and LDTs) and to mark low theft lines never before subject to parts
marking. Extra time is needed for manufacturers to buy equipment, determine vehicles' target areas for parts marking,
and to decide whether to submit a petition for exemption from parts marking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA also believes that all manufacturers should begin the new procedures in the same model year. MY 1997 is the earliest
model year for which all manufacturers can ensure that their lines comply.

V. Regulatory Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

1. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking
action and has determined the action not to be ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory
policies and procedures. This action defines ``light-duty truck'' (LDT) and ``multipurpose passenger vehicle''
(MPV) and specifies LDT and MPV parts that should be considered ``major parts.'' As a result of defining LDT and MPV,
those lines are now included as ``passenger motor vehicle'' lines subject to the Theft Prevention Standard. In this
final rule, the definition of LDT affects low theft lines that are selected for parts marking, pursuant to 49 U.S.C.
section 33103. Since section 33103(a) excludes LDTs from its coverage, any passenger motor vehicle with a low theft
rate (other than an LDT) would be subject to parts marking. The definition clarifies which vehicles Congress intended
to be subject, as LDTs, to the marking of high theft passenger motor vehicle lines, but excluded from the potential
rules for marking of low theft passenger motor vehicle lines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, the selection of the MPV and LDT parts to be marked is already, in large part, decided by Congress in 49 U.S.C.
33101, since the term ``major parts'' is defined at 49 U.S.C. 33101(6). However, the agency has authority under section
33101(6)(L) to make modifications to the statutory list, and for major parts of LDTs and MPVs, has exercised this authority.
The overall cost of marking the MPVs and LDTs would, in any event, be limited to the $15 (in 1984 dollars), or $20.86 (in
1993 dollars, based on the U.S. Department of Labor's United States City Average All Items Consumer Price Index for
All Urban Consumers (See 59 FR 8021, February 17, 1994)) per vehicle maximum specified in section 33105(a).

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this final rule, high theft MPVs and LDTs, and lines listed in Appendix B must add parts marking for a total of $5.06
per vehicle. Based on 1991 production figures, an additional 7.4 million would need to be marked, making the approximate
cost of marking high theft MPVs, LDTs, and lines listed in Appendix B, $37 million. However, NHTSA believes the $37
million estimate is high because many manufacturers will petition for approval to use an antitheft device, in lieu
of parts marking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, NHTSA estimates that the total cost of this final rule would be approximately $37 million, considerably less
than the $89 million estimated in the NPRM, which included costs to mark glazing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA cannot estimate the benefits of this final rule. The average value of a stolen vehicle is approximately $6,100.
Thus, this final rule would have to result in the prevention of about 6,100 vehicle thefts ($37 million divided by $6,100)
to break even with the costs imposed.

The agency has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify
that this proposed rule, if made final, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. As already noted, this final rule defines ``light duty truck'' and ``multipurpose passenger vehicle,''
and specifies parts for MPVs and LDTs that should be designated as ``major parts.'' The final rule itself will have
minimal effects on small manufacturers of passenger motor vehicles, as almost none of the manufacturers of passenger
motor vehicles that may be subject to this rule is considered a small business. This final rule will have no effect on
small organizations or governmental units that purchase passenger motor vehicles. Accordingly, the agency has
not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On May 15, 1991, NHTSA made several technical amendments to conform the language of part 567, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Certification,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 to new regulations, issued in September 1989, regarding the importation of motor vehicles not originally manufactured
in compliance with the Federal motor vehicle safety standards (56 FR 22355). The reader is referred to that notice
for further information on this subject. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Inadvertently, the agency neglected to include paragraph 567.4(k) in the amendments to part 567. Paragraph (k) applies
to those ``passenger cars admitted to the United States under 19 CFR 12.80(b)(1)'' which lack an original manufacturer's
certification of compliance with the Federal motor vehicle safety standards. The correct citation is to Paragraph
591.5(f). This notice effects that correction. The notice also revises the authority citations to reflect the recodification
in Title 49 of the agency's authorities previously in Title 15. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the amendment is technical in nature and has no substantive impact, it is hereby found that notice and comment
thereon are unnecessary, and that good cause is shown that an effective date earlier than 180 days after issuance of
the rule is in the public interest. Therefore, the amendment is effective upon publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending its regulations governing the content and format on labeling for
human prescription drug products. The final rule revises the current ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the professional
labeling requirements for prescription drugs to provide for the inclusion of more complete information about the
use of a drug in the pediatric population (ages birth to 16 years). The final rule, which applies to prescription drug
products (including biological prescription drug products), recognizes several methods of establishing substantial
evidence to support pediatric labeling claims, including relying, in certain cases, on studies carried out in adults.
This final rule also requires that if there is not substantial evidence to support any pediatric use or use in a particular
pediatric population, the labeling shall state this. Sponsors must reexamine existing data to determine whether
the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling can be modified based on adequate and well-controlled studies in
adults, and other information supporting pediatric use, and, if appropriate, submit a supplemental application
to comply with new &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv) by December 13, 1996. This action responds to concerns in FDA and elsewhere
that current prescription drug labeling often does not contain adequate information about the use of drugs in the
pediatric population. This action promotes safer and more effective use of prescription drugs in the pediatric population.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 16, 1992 (57 FR 47423), FDA proposed to amend its regulations pertaining to the content and format of prescription
drug labeling in &sect;201.57 by revising the current ``Pediatric use'' subsection (&sect;201.57(f)(9)) to allow
a broader basis for the inclusion of information about use of a drug in the pediatric population. The proposal would
have allowed pediatric claims based not only on adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population
but also, in some cases, on such trials in adults. The proposed regulation described other data needed when pediatric
claims are based on trials in adults and indicated specific labeling language and the location of various kinds of
information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA issued the current pediatric labeling requirements in 1979 (44 FR 37434, June 26, 1979). The current regulation,
codified at &sect;201.57(f)(9), requires that specific pediatric indications, if any, be described under the ``Indications
and Usage'' section of the labeling, with appropriate pediatric dosage provided under the ``Dosage and Administration''
section. The current regulation also requires that recommendations for pediatric use be based on substantial evidence
derived from adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, unless that requirement is waived.
If a drug's safety and effectiveness in the pediatric population cannot be established or if the drug's use in the pediatric
population is associated with a specific hazard, the current regulation requires appropriate statements or details.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By establishing a ``Pediatric use'' subsection and describing its content and format, the 1979 regulation was intended
to encourage drug labeling that would regularly provide adequate information about use of prescription drugs in
pediatric patients. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule on which this final rule is based, however, most
prescription drug products still lack adequate information about their use in pediatric populations. For example,
an informal survey done in 1990 by the American Academy of Pediatrics examined labeling of all new molecular entities
approved between 1984 and 1989 and found that 80 percent had no information on pediatric use. Other surveys have shown
that the labeling for many prescription drugs states that safety and effectiveness in children have not been established
and contains no information on pediatric use, even for drugs that are commonly prescribed for pediatric patients.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA continues to be concerned that, without adequate information, practitioners may be reluctant to prescribe certain
drugs for their pediatric patients, or may prescribe them inappropriately, choosing dosages, for instance, that
are arbitrarily based on the child's age, body weight, or body surface area without specific information as to whether
this is appropriate. As a result, pediatric patients may be exposed to an increased risk of adverse reactions, or decreased
effectiveness of the drugs prescribed, or may be denied access to valuable therapeutic agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The continuing absence of pediatric use information in prescription drug labeling may be due in part to the impression,
perhaps conveyed by the existing regulation, that pediatric claims must always be based on adequate and well-controlled
studies conducted in the pediatric population. Given the many problems associated with the testing of drugs in the
pediatric population (e.g., obtaining informed consent for tests not directly of benefit to the child, use of placebo
controls in a vulnerable population), studies meeting this standard are often difficult to obtain. Existing FDA
regulations do not, in fact, require that controlled trials always be conducted in the pediatric population to support
a pediatric use. Under current &sect;201.57(f)(9), the need for such studies may be waived where other data can satisfy
the requirements of law. The basis for granting such a waiver is not, however, clear in the existing regulation. Section
201.57(f)(9)(iv) of this final rule clarifies how the agency will determine that data from adequate and well-controlled
studies with adult subjects can provide substantial evidence of effectiveness in the pediatric population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, this rule is intended to provide practitioners with more pediatric use information in the labeling of
human prescription drug products so that practitioners will have more reliable information upon which to base a decision
to prescribe a drug for use in their pediatric patients. The rule does this by encouraging manufacturers to provide
more information on drug labels upon which practitioners can base their decisions. The rule does not, however, limit
the manner in which a practitioner may prescribe an approved drug.

II. Highlights of the Final Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule revises the current ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the professional labeling requirements for prescription
drugs to provide for the inclusion of more comprehensive information about use of a drug in the pediatric population.
Under the final rule, products may be labeled for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults
together with other information supporting pediatric use (e.g., pharmacokinetic data, safety data, pharmacodynamic
data). Such reliance on studies in adults was possible under the waiver provision in the existing rule, but the waiver
provision was not often used. Of course, products may also be labeled for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled
studies in the pediatric population. The pediatric age group, birth to 16 years, includes pediatric age groups often
called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents. In the final rule, because the term ``children'' can be interpreted
as referring only to a particular subset of the pediatric population (ages 2 to 12 years), and to make clear that the
provisions of this rule apply to the entire pediatric population, references to ``children'' in the proposed rule
have been deleted and replaced by ``pediatric population'' or ``pediatric patients.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major provisions of the final rule are summarized as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule continues to permit a specific pediatric indication (i.e., an indication different from those approved
in adults) supported by adequate and well-controlled studies in the appropriate pediatric population, to be described
under the ``Indications and Usage'' section of the labeling, with the appropriate pediatric dosage given under the
``Dosage and Administration'' section of the labeling. The ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling must include
any limitations on the pediatric indication, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards of the drug, differences
between pediatric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective use of the
drug in pediatric patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If there are specific statements on pediatric use of the drug for an indication also approved for adults that are based
on adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, they must be summarized in the ``Pediatric
use'' subsection of the labeling and discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ``Clinical Pharmacology''
and ``Clinical Studies'' sections. Appropriate pediatric dosage must be given under the ``Dosage and Administration''
section of the labeling. This subsection of the labeling must also cite any limitations on the pediatric use statement,
need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with use of the drug in any subsets of the pediatric population
(e.g., neonates), differences between pediatric and adult responses to the drug, and other information related
to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A pediatric use statement may also be based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, provided that the agency
concludes that the course of the disease and the drug's effects are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult
populations to permit extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. Where needed, pharmacokinetic
data to allow determination of an appropriate pediatric dosage, and additional pediatric safety information must
also be submitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a specific pediatric indication or a pediatric
use statement have not been met for a particular pediatric subgroup, the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling
must contain a statement that appropriately characterizes the limitation, such as ``Safety and effectiveness in
pediatric patients [below the age of (_) (years/months/weeks)] have not been established.'' If use of the drug is
associated with a specific hazard in this pediatric subgroup, the ``Pediatric use'' subsection must contain information
about this hazard, or, where appropriate, refer to a more complete description of the hazard in the ``Contraindications''
or ``Warnings'' section of the labeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pediatric indication or a pediatric use
statement have not been met for any pediatric population, the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling must contain
the following statement: ``Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.'' If use of
the drug in premature or neonatal infants, or other pediatric subgroups, is associated with a specific hazard, the
``Pediatric use'' subsection must contain information about this hazard, or, where appropriate, refer to a more
complete description of the hazard in the ``Contraindications'' or ``Warnings'' section of the labeling.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any sponsor who believes that no ``Pediatric use'' subsection is appropriate or relevant to the labeling of its particular
drug product must provide FDA with reasons justifying its omission, and may propose alternative statement(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, recognizing the hazards that inactive ingredients can pose to the pediatric population, the final rule
requires that prescription drug labeling contain statements about inactive ingredients that might be toxic to the
neonate or other pediatric subgroup.

III. General Comments on the Proposed Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA received 11 comments on the proposed rule from prescription drug manufacturers, prescribers, professional
societies, organizations with special interests in the pediatric population, the lay public, and others. Most supported
the proposed labeling change, calling it ``timely and important,'' ``an important * * * step to facilitate the inclusion
of information about use of drugs in children in the approved labeling,'' ``a significant step toward the goal of including
infants and children in the drug approval process,'' and a way ``to fill the gap of information that currently exists
in the area of appropriate drug usage in children.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment, for example, stated that providing pediatric use information in labeling will help health professionals
reach rational drug therapy decisions for pediatric patients. The comment added ``any information that can be used
by pharmacists to assure rational drug therapy in special populations will be a positive addition to drug information.
* * * Such labeling will enhance the likelihood of positive outcomes in pediatric patients.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, some comments were less supportive, including one that stated: ``While * * * [we] commend the FDA on its initiatives
to improve information available to physicians and their pediatric patients regarding prescription drug use, we
remain concerned that this approach will not measurably assist physicians.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most comments also raised specific issues for consideration by the agency. These issues are described below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Definition of ``Pediatric'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Several comments suggested that age breakdowns within the pediatric population might be appropriate. The pediatric
age range begins at birth, and may cover individuals as old as 18 years to 21 years, encompassing the subspecialties
of neonatology and adolescent medicine. One comment suggested that the rule define ``pediatric'' as children under
12 years, because ``it has been commonly accepted that ages 12 years to 18 years may be included without previous clinical
work in that age group.'' The comment also suggested that the rule state the age group when pharmacokinetic studies
should be done in order to extrapolate the results from infancy through adolescence, or state whether the age range
will be broken into subgroups with testing required for each. Another comment said that a definition of ``pediatric''
would have to consider drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, and interaction with various organs and other body systems.
The comment suggested that a system by which distinct classes of drugs are considered differently may be more logical
and appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment noted that pediatric patients are not homogeneous, and that age groups show significant differences
in functional and physiological functions. The comment suggested that information from clinical studies be subdivided
by age groups and their respective responses to drugs, suggesting age categories of premature infant, newborn, children
under 2 years of age, children 2 years to 13 years, and adolescents 13 years to 18 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment said that individuals 16 years to 18 years of age pose particular problems and suggested consultation
with the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Drugs to consider defining age categories or groups for pediatric
labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ``Pediatric use'' subsection of labeling is where information about use of a drug in pediatric patients is located,
and &sect;201.57(f)(9) describes in general terms the kind of information that should be included. The ``Pediatric
use'' subsection does not attempt to resolve the many difficult issues related to use of drugs in this population.
What appears in this subsection (e.g., age groups covered) will depend on the data available, and the ability to define
results for specific subgroups. As a general matter, however, the agency offers the following guidance and useful
breakdowns. The following age categories for the pediatric population are commonly distinguished, although the
distinctions are inevitably arbitrary: (1) Birth up to 1 month (neonates), (2) 1 month up to 2 years of age (infants),
(3) 2 years up to 12 years (children), and (4) 12 years up to 16 years (adolescents). Where possible, data should be analyzed
by these groups, but it should not usually be necessary to establish a drug product's effectiveness in each group.
It may, on the other hand, be important to have some pharmacokinetic information in each group, especially the younger
age groups, to guide dosing and additional information, such as a specific study in neonates, to establish safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the agency has determined that the term ``pediatric patients'' refers to individuals from birth to 16 years
of age, the agency recognizes that for some drugs, adult studies may be applicable to pediatric patients under the
age of 16 years who have passed puberty; indeed, a primary purpose of this rule is to allow pediatric labeling based
on adult studies, when appropriate. Although in many cases, additional pharmacokinetic and safety data may be needed
to support pediatric use statements, in other cases, particularly for pediatric patients in the 12-to 16-year age
group, there may be less additional data needed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. One comment noted that about 80 percent of drug labeling currently contains language excluding use of the drug in
pediatric patients or limiting use only to specific age groups. The comment asked FDA to encourage sponsors to include
pediatric patients in their clinical studies when the drug is likely to be effective for an indication in this population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, FDA encourages sponsors to include pediatric patients in their clinical
studies, and analyzes investigational new drug applications and new drug applications (NDA's) to determine whether
studies in this population should be done before the drug is approved (57 FR 47423 at 47424). Under certain circumstances,
the agency may require that clinical studies in the pediatric population be conducted before marketing approval
(see response to comment number 4 in section III.C. of this document). If a drug is likely to be effective for pediatric
use, the agency is making it clear that labeling for pediatric use may sometimes be based on adequate and well-controlled
studies in adults, with additional pediatric data. FDA intends that this rule will call further attention to the need
for creating and reviewing data on pediatric use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. One comment asked whether FDA intended to require a sponsor to submit information for a specific pediatric indication
or use if there are available data suggesting that such an indication or use would be permitted under the regulation.
The comment said that there may be ``good reasons'' why a sponsor might not wish to seek a pediatric indication or use
for a drug even when available evidence would support such a use. For example, the drug's benefit/risk ratio in the
pediatric population might be different from that in adults, or there might be sufficient and better alternative
therapies available for the pediatric use. Additionally, the comment expressed concern that a drug that has been
tested in adults may not provide a sufficient legal defense against a claim for injury of a child. The comment said that
a sponsor should not be forced to assume or be placed in the position of having to defend such an action unless the sponsor
believes the data in support of the pediatric use are sufficient, and that a sponsor should not be mandated or forced
by the rule to seek a pediatric use if the sponsor, for whatever reason, does not wish to do so.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment expressed concern that FDA might delay approval of products that have good existing available data
for safety and efficacy in adults while acceptable pediatric information is developed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule does not add a new requirement that sponsors carry out new pediatric studies, nor does it require that sponsors
submit labeling with claims that are inadequately supported. New &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv) provides that a pediatric
use statement may be based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, provided that the course of the disease
and the drug effects are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations to permit extrapolation from
the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. Sponsors are required to reexamine existing data to determine whether
the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling can be modified based on adequate and well-controlled studies in
adults, and other information supporting pediatric use, and, if safety and effectiveness for pediatric use have
been demonstrated, submit a supplemental application to comply with new &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv) by December 13,
1996. A sponsor who does not believe that the disease and drug effects are similar in the pediatric and adult populations,
or who believes that use in pediatric patients is otherwise not adequately supported by data, should not propose revised
labeling under this provision. Under new &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vi), the sponsor may propose labeling stating that
safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, under new &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vii), if the sponsor believes that none of the statements described
in paragraphs (f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(vi) of that section is appropriate or relevant to the labeling of a particular
drug, the sponsor must provide reasons for omission of the statements and may propose alternative statement(s).
In response to such a proposal, FDA may permit use of an alternative statement if FDA determines that no statement described
in those paragraphs is appropriate or relevant to the drug's labeling and that the alternative statement is accurate
and appropriate. Section 201.57(f)(9)(vii) has been modified to make this explicit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this rule does not add new requirements for conducting pediatric studies, various provisions of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), the Public Health Service Act (the PHS act), and existing regulations authorize
FDA to require such studies under certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 505(k) of the act (21 U.S.C. 355(k)), FDA may require NDA holders to establish records and submit reports
to the agency on data relating to clinical experience or other data or information in order to determine whether there
may be grounds for revoking the NDA approval. Such a requirement may be established either through regulation or through
an order regarding the NDA (21 U.S.C. 355(k)(1)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Existing regulations require application holders to report to the agency adverse experiences occurring in the course
of use of the product in professional practice, as well as during clinical investigations (21 CFR 312.32, 314.80).
In addition, approved application holders must submit as part of the annual report a summary of significant new information
that might affect the safety, effectiveness, or labeling of the product, as well as copies of unpublished and published
reports of studies of the drug (21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(v), and (b)(2)(vi)). The report also must contain
a description of the action the company has taken or intends to take because of the new information, such as submission
of a supplement, addition of a warning, or initiation of a new study (21 CFR 314.81(b)(2)(i)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 505(e) of the act specifies grounds on which the agency may withdraw or suspend approval of an NDA. If there
is an imminent hazard to the public health, approval of the NDA may be suspended immediately by the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services. In addition to other circumstances, approval of an NDA is to be withdrawn
if clinical experience or other data show that the product is unsafe or not shown to be safe under the conditions of use
upon the basis of which the application was approved. Moreover, the approval may be withdrawn if the labeling is false
or misleading and not corrected within a reasonable time after notice of the matter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 502(a) of the act (21 U.S.C. 352(a)), a drug is considered misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading.
Section 201(n) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(n)) makes it clear that the ``misleading'' determination is to be based not
only on representations made or suggested in the labeling, but also on failure to reveal material facts. Material
facts include those which concern consequences which may result from use of the product under the labeled conditions
of use or under customary or usual conditions of use. These conditions of use may include off-label uses prescribed
by practitioners for their patients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, drugs are considered misbranded under section 502(f) of the act if the labeling fails to bear adequate
directions for use. FDA regulations define adequate directions for use as directions under which the lay person can
use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). ``Intended uses'' are further defined
in the regulations to include uses other than the ones on the labeling (21 CFR 201.128). If a manufacturer knows that
a drug is used for an off-label use, the manufacturer may be required to provide adequate labeling for that use (21 CFR
201.128).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prescription drugs for human use are exempt from the requirement to carry adequate directions for lay use under certain
circumstances, if labeled with the prescription legend (21 CFR 201.100). Among the exemption criteria is the requirement
that the drug carry adequate labeling for the prescriber, as authorized by an approved application, for the intended
use. In summary, the drug product is misbranded if the intended use is not approved in an NDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Drug products are also misbranded, under section 502(f)(2) of the act, if the labeling does not carry adequate warnings
against unsafe use. Such unsafe use may include use by pediatric patients where the use may be dangerous to their health,
or unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration in the pediatric population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biological drug products are approved under authority of section 351 of the PHS act (42 U.S.C. 262). This provision
authorizes the promulgation of regulations designed to ensure the continued safety, purity, and potency of the products
(42 U.S.C. 262(d)(1)). An approved product license application (PLA) may be revoked if the product does not conform
to applicable requirements in the regulations or is not safe and effective for all of its intended uses or is misbranded
with respect to any such use (21 CFR 601.5(b)(4) through (b)(6)). If there is a danger to health, the Commissioner may
suspend the product license (21 CFR 601.6). Under section 351(b) of the PHS act, no one may falsely label a biological
product. Biological drug products are also subject to the applicable drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act, as previously discussed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the agency has stated that an application for marketing approval should contain data on a reasonable sample
of the patients likely to be given a drug once it is marketed (58 FR 39406 at 39409, July 22, 1993). This conclusion, stated
explicitly in a guideline on the need for data in both genders, applies equally to age subgroups, including pediatric
and geriatric populations. FDA may refuse to approve an application that fails to contain sufficient information
to determine whether the product can be safely and effectively used in populations likely to receive it. In addition,
for an approved drug, in certain cases (e.g., where the drug is widely used, represents a potential hazard, or is therapeutically
important in pediatric patients), FDA may require further studies in pediatric populations and appropriate labeling
changes. As previously discussed, an already approved drug may be considered illegally marketed if adequate information
on safe and effective use in pediatric patients is not obtained and included in the labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency thus expects sponsors to seek supplemental claims for pediatric uses that are supported by adequate data.
This does not imply, however, that a sponsor should seek a claim for a pediatric use if the benefits of that use do not
outweigh its risks; the determination of whether to include a pediatric use statement must be based on clinical data,
and other use information, not on a vague concern about liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. One comment said that although the desire to use potentially relevant data in the ``Pediatric use'' subsection
of the labeling was ``understandable,'' such data should not take the place of adequate and well-designed controlled
studies in the pediatric population, and that FDA ultimately may have to require such studies. The comment stated
that FDA should require manufacturers to fund research projects regarding drug safety and efficacy, including short-term
and long-term side effects, in pediatric patients. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that clinical studies regarding a drug's safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients are desirable,
and the agency encourages such studies in appropriate cases. As discussed in comment 4 in section III.C. of this document,
the agency has the authority to require such studies under certain circumstances. In some cases, such studies may
be required prior to approval where pediatric use is important and where the adult and pediatric diseases cannot be
considered sufficiently similar. In other cases, the controlled trials in adults, with pharmacokinetic and other
data as needed, may support valid pediatric labeling. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. One comment stated that FDA should consider other alternatives to the rule, including a formal review process that
collects and analyzes available safety and efficacy data on a drug's use in the pediatric population both before and
after marketing approval, which, through committee review, could recommend further testing of the drug after it
is marketed if specific pediatric safety or efficacy concerns are found. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the comment has misinterpreted the purpose of the rule. The rule describes the kind of data and information
that can be included in labeling for the pediatric population. In general, it is the sponsor's responsibility to collect,
on a continuing basis, available data on safety and efficacy, propose revised labeling, and carry out needed studies.
In some circumstances, FDA has required pediatric studies prior to approval, elicited agreement by drug sponsors
at the time of marketing approval to carry out additional pediatric studies after approval, or stimulated conduct
of pediatric studies after approval. When appropriate, FDA makes use of its standing advisory committees to help
decide whether and when pediatric studies are needed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. One comment stated that FDA should revise the rule to specify what data must be provided by manufacturers. The comment
asked what number of pediatric patients would be sufficient to determine if there is a difference in age-related response,
and how FDA will determine that all available information about the pediatric use of all available drugs has been included,
including epidemiologic studies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA declines to accept the comment's suggestion. The agency believes that specifying an exact number of pediatric
patients to be studied would be impractical due to variations in the pediatric population and responses to different
drugs. This is particularly true, given the various kinds of data that can be used under the rule to support pediatric
labeling.

8. One comment suggested that drugs currently under development or under review by FDA should be given special consideration
to avoid delays in development and approval associated with implementation of the rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not expect delays in review or approval as a result of this rule. FDA already examines available pediatric
data under current labeling regulations. The principal change created by the revised regulation is the ability to
rely on studies in adults to support pediatric efficacy in some situations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. One comment suggested that FDA work with manufacturers of approved drugs to develop a method that allows the manufacturers
to update their labeling in a quick and cost-effective manner. The comment also said that package inserts do not generally
reflect current scientific literature because of the problems with current methods of updating labeling. The comment
said that this had created situations where prescribers are making decisions on treatment modalities without the
benefit of timely information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA does not believe that changes in regulations are needed to allow timely updating of labeling. Under the current
regulations, applicants can propose changes in their approved labeling. FDA normally reviews supplements subject
to prior approval in the order received. Effectiveness supplements are rated as priority or standard and are subject
to performance goals set in connection with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. One comment said that the filing and approval of pediatric labeling supplements from different sponsors on different
timetables could mean that some labels for products considered to be substantially similar might be silent with regard
to pediatric usage, while others might be detailed. The comment suggested that FDA and the American Academy of Pediatrics'
Committee on Drugs could identify therapeutic classes to be relabeled first, so that FDA could review and approve
pediatric use labeling for products from different companies and coordinate implementation of labeling changes
for similar agents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to effectiveness claims, pharmacokinetics, and safety data, much information is drug specific and
will be reviewed as it is submitted. Therefore, the agency is not adopting the comment's suggestions. The agency advises,
however, that, in general, when a class of drug products is involved, FDA examines labeling as it applies to the class.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
11. One comment claimed that the rule places NDA holders at a competitive disadvantage relative to abbreviated new
drug application (ANDA) holders. The comment stated that the rule would give NDA holders the burden and responsibility
for pediatric studies and literature searches, but not impose a similar burden and responsibility on ANDA holders.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA disagrees with the comment in part. The rule is directed to anyone marketing a prescription drug and is intended
to encourage the inclusion of more complete information about use of a drug in the pediatric population and about hazards
associated with this use. The rule permits a new basis for reference to pediatric uses, but it does not impose a new requirement
to conduct studies in pediatric populations. To the extent that NDA holders have access to data not available to ANDA
holders, they will have more data to examine and more likelihood of having a basis for proposing changes to the ``Pediatric
use'' subsection of labeling. The agency believes this represents only a modest burden and, in any event, sees no other
way to gain further pediatric information in labeling. ANDA holders cannot be required to examine data they do not
possess. ANDA holders are not precluded from providing pediatric use data, and are expected to do so under this rule,
if data are available. An ANDA applicant who believes new safety or effectiveness information should be added to a
product's labeling should provide adequate supporting information to FDA, and FDA will determine whether the labeling
for the generic and listed drugs should be revised.

G. Minor Editorial Changes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. One comment said that labeling revisions that are editorial in nature and are used to reformat existing pediatric
use labeling information to conform to the rule should be made in accordance with &sect;314.70(d) (21 CFR 314.70(d))
(changes described in the annual report). The comment said that this would also facilitate the agency's processing
of minor changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees with the comment. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, ``[m]inor editorial changes may be made
in accordance with &sect;314.70(d)'' (57 FR 47423 at 47426). To comply with this rule, references to ``children''
in the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the insert labeling of products already being marketed must be changed, where
appropriate, to ``pediatric population'' or ``pediatric patients.'' For products other than biological products,
such changes are considered minor editorial changes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, for biological products, such changes are to be submitted in accordance
with the procedures outlined in &sect;601.12 (21 CFR 601.12) (57 FR 47423 at 47426).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
13. One comment said that it is impractical and impossible to list on the labeling all dosages and hazards for the pediatric
population. The comment suggested placement of a general label on all adult prescription drugs stating that the medication
should not be given to pediatric patients without a physician's instructions. The comment said that requiring overly
complicated and lengthy information on labeling would discourage the prescribing of needed medications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the comment misinterprets the proposed rule and the purpose of pediatric use labeling. The purpose
of the rule is to encourage more pediatric use information in labeling and to provide practitioners with more information
on pediatric use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. One comment said that for certain products, e.g., corticosteroids, where class labeling has been in effect, the
agency will have to decide and communicate how the pediatric wording will be addressed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In most cases, pediatric labeling will be drug specific. Where class labeling exists, FDA generally examines the
labeling for those products as a whole.

A. Section 201.57(f)(9)(i)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA, on its own initiative, has added a definition in &sect;201.57(f)(9)(i) to indicate that under paragraphs (f)(9)(ii)
through (f)(9)(viii), the terms ``pediatric population(s)'' and ``pediatric patient(s)'' are defined as the pediatric
age group, from birth to 16 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA received no comments on these provisions (renumbered as &sect;201.57(f)(9)(ii) and (f)(9)(iii)), and has finalized
them without change.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iii)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iii) (renumbered as &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv)) states, in part, that ``FDA may approve
a drug for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, with other information supporting
pediatric use. In such cases, the agency will have concluded that the course of the disease and the effects of the drugs
are sufficiently similar in children and adults to permit extrapolation from the adult data to children. The additional
information supporting pediatric use must include data on the pharmacokinetics of the drug in children for determination
of pediatric dosage. Other information, such as data from pharmacodynamic studies of the drug in children, controlled
or uncontrolled studies confirming the safety or effectiveness of the drug in children, pertinent premarketing
or postmarketing studies or experience, may be necessary to establish the applicability of the adult data to children.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. One comment said FDA should revise proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iii) to indicate that pharmacokinetic data
are not mandatory in some situations. Another comment stated that pharmacokinetic data may not be the most appropriate
way to determine pediatric dosing because the differences in metabolism or in distribution in pediatric patients
may support dosing that will not necessarily be related to blood levels. Both comments stated that dosing for inhalation
products should not be based on pharmacokinetics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment said that difficulties in obtaining informed consent, use of placebo controls, and obtaining adequate
blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis in pediatric patients are not serious impediments to performing studies
necessary for appropriate pediatric labeling. The comment said there is a well-established ethical structure within
which informed consent may be obtained and placebo controls used in the pediatric population, and that current technology
requires only very small blood samples for measurement of most compounds. According to the comment, the primary impediments
to doing adequate clinical trials in the pediatric population are the absence of a regulatory mandate and the existence
of economic disincentives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency recognizes that pharmacokinetic data are important sources of information, but may not always be the most
appropriate method for determining pediatric dosing schedules and may be infeasible, unnecessary, or insufficient.
Other types of data or experience may sometimes substitute for pharmacokinetic data, and other data or experience
in the pediatric population may be needed in addition to pharmacokinetic data. The agency has modified the rule to
state that the additional information supporting pediatric use must 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ordinarily
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 include data on the pharmacokinetics of the drug in the pediatric population for determination of pediatric dosage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in response to comment 4 in section III.C. of this document, this rule does not create a new requirement
for pediatric studies, but the authority for requiring pediatric studies already exists. There are situations in
which data on safe and effective use in pediatric patients may be necessary for approval or for continued marketing
of a drug. Revised &sect;201.57(f)(9) does not create the requirement for pediatric studies, but is intended to encourage
the inclusion of more comprehensive labeling about pediatric use by permitting use of adult data in establishing
pediatric efficacy. Specifically, the rule allows the pediatric use statement to be based on adequate and well-controlled
studies in adults when additional information exists to show that the course of the disease and the effects of the drug
are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients to permit extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to
pediatric populations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA has, on its own initiative, amended proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iii) to indicate that FDA's determination
whether the effects of a drug are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients will include an examination
of the drug's beneficial and adverse effects. FDA has also amended &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iii) to make clear that other
information besides pharmacokinetic data may be necessary not simply to ``establish the applicability of the adult
data to pediatric patients,'' but, more generally, ``to show that the drug can be used safely and effectively in pediatric
patients.'' Section 201.57(f)(9)(iii) has also been modified to remove any potential misimpression that uncontrolled
studies could demonstrate effectiveness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. One comment questioned the rule's language about extrapolating adult data to pediatric patients. The comment
said that the exact mechanism by which many psychiatric drugs work is not known, so that, for these drug products, extrapolation
between adult and pediatric populations may be inaccurate and potentially hazardous. The comment noted that randomized
controlled studies of tricyclic antidepressants in pediatric patients have raised questions regarding efficacy,
while safety issues have been raised based on noncontrolled data indicating a potential risk, which might not have
been clear based on adult data, of sudden cardiac death in pediatric patients using tricyclics.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA agrees that extrapolation from adult experience is inappropriate, and thus unacceptable, in some cases. Extrapolation
is not necessary under the rule, but is an alternative to the conduct of adequate and well-controlled studies in pediatric
patients. In those cases where the pediatric use statement is based primarily on adequate and well-controlled studies
in adults, additional information supporting pediatric use is usually needed, ordinarily including data on the
pharmacokinetics of the drug in the pediatric population for determination of pediatric dosage. Other information,
such as data from pharmacodynamic studies of the drug in pediatric patients, data from other studies supporting the
safety or effectiveness of the drug in pediatric patients, pertinent premarketing or postmarketing studies or experience,
may be necessary to show that the drug can be used safely and effectively in the pediatric population.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. One comment said that the preamble to the final regulation should clarify that ``other information'' supporting
pediatric use in proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iii) need not be limited to data developed or sponsored by the NDA holder,
but may include data such as reports of studies by academic researchers in peer-review journals that were prepared
by persons who are not related to the NDA sponsor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that no change is needed in revised &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv) because the section does not suggest
that the data must have been developed or sponsored by the NDA holder.

change.

E. Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(v)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(v) (renumbered as &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vi)) provides, in part, that ``[i]f the requirements
for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pediatric indication or a pediatric use statement have not been
met for any pediatric population, this subsection of the labeling shall contain the following statement: `Safety
and effectiveness in children have not been established.''' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. One comment expressed concern that this provision may create disincentives for sponsors to develop better information
on pediatric use of their drugs. The comment suggested that FDA require mandatory phased-in safety testing and appropriate
clinical studies of pharmaceuticals in the pediatric population. Alternatively, the comment recommended that
FDA and manufacturers work to develop agreements whereby the manufacturer consents to carry out additional postapproval
pediatric studies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA believes that the comment suggests actions beyond the scope of this rule. FDA encourages pediatric testing, and,
as discussed in comment 4 in section III.C. of this document, has the authority to require pediatric studies. In some
cases, FDA will require pediatric studies for approval or continued marketing. This rule, however, does not add new
requirements for pediatric studies, but rather describes the kind of data that can be used to support labeling claims.

F. Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vi)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vi) (renumbered as &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vii)) provides ``[i]f the sponsor believes
that none of the statements described in paragraphs (f)(9)(i) through (f)(9)(v) (renumbered as (f)(9)(ii) through
(f)(9)(vi)) of this section is appropriate or relevant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor shall provide
reasons for omission of the statements and may propose alternative statement(s). FDA may permit use of an alternative
statement.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
19. One comment asserted that the proposal did not adequately address the problem of a large number of drugs that have
been approved and marketed for years without pediatric usage information in their labeling, which are widely used
in pediatric patients and for which there is substantial published literature regarding their pediatric use. The
comment noted that proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vi) would impose on the sponsor the responsibility for providing
information that would promote the safe and effective use of prescription drugs in pediatric patients and noted that
the sponsor may have complex reasons for not necessarily wanting to include pediatric information in the labeling.
The comment recommended that the final rule include a mechanism that would allow summary information from authoritative
published literature to be added to the labeling of currently marketed drugs so this information would be available
to the pediatric prescriber. It suggested that the rule should provide an option permitting ``recognized authoritative
medical experts or groups of experts'' to provide information to support pediatric information in the labeling in
lieu of the sponsor.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment urged the agency to provide for the incorporation of supplemental indications into drug labeling
based solely on information submitted by persons other than the sponsor. The comment said that changes should be made
based on studies reported in peer-reviewed medical literature, rather than relying on submissions by the sponsor.
The comment stated that this was necessary to make the labeling of certain drugs, particularly anticancer agents,
conform to the current state of medical knowledge. The comment noted that FDA restricts promotion of off-label uses,
and third-party payers often take the position that agents that have no labeled indication for treatment of cancers
in pediatric patients are experimental and therefore nonreimbursable, even though they may be safe and effective.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sponsor is primarily responsible for bringing forth evidence to support labeling changes. A third party could,
however, provide evidence to persuade the agency to direct the sponsor to submit a labeling supplement. A study need
not have been conducted by or on behalf of the sponsor in order to support a labeling change. The evidence to support
labeling should continue to be of the type and quality that would ordinarily support labeling statements. Published
literature on pediatric use may contribute to this evidence, and authoritative groups may suggest approaches, but
the views of authoritative groups do not themselves represent sufficient evidence of effectiveness. With respect
to the comment concerning reimbursements, the agency advises that reimbursements to patients are beyond the scope
of the rule and FDA authority. However, FDA agrees with the underlying concern that appropriate indications be on
the label so that practitioners understand how best to prescribe the drug for the patient's medical benefit.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
G. Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vii)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vii) (renumbered as &sect;201.57(f)(9)(viii)) states ``[i]f the drug product contains
one or more excipients that present an increased risk of toxic effects to neonates or other pediatric subgroups, a
special note of this risk, generally in the `Contraindications,' `Warnings,' or `Precautions' section, shall be
made.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
20. Four comments expressed concern about this proposed requirement. One comment said that the data relating to the
toxicity of excipients, including preservatives, are inconclusive, making the requirement inappropriate. The
comment stated that FDA should encourage collection and analysis of data to enable specific determinations on the
use of excipients and preservatives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another comment asked FDA to clarify whether the proposed requirement that labeling contain statements about excipients
that present an increased risk of adverse effects to the neonate or other pediatric subgroups was intended to reflect
published literature or to be based on studies designed to show whether an increased risk exists. It added that it was
not clear how or by whom a determination of increased risk would be established. The comment suggested that the final
rule state that a sponsor can rely on existing information and is not required to conduct additional studies. The comment
also suggested that, if additional studies were necessary, animal data be used rather than requiring clinical studies
in neonates. It suggested that a standardized list could be developed jointly by industry and FDA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A third comment suggested that a requirement that any labeling identify any increased risk of toxic effects to neonates
or other pediatric groups should not be interpreted as establishing a requirement that sponsors conduct toxicology
or other studies to identify or quantify such risks. The comment also stated that the preamble to the final regulation
should state whether the increased risk of toxic effects is limited to those established by human data or experience,
or would also include those based on animal or in vitro models.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A fourth comment noted that ANDA holders may use excipients different from those used by the reference listed drug.
The comment suggested that ANDA holders should be required to provide specific information regarding excipients
used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule requires the labeling for a drug product containing one or more inactive ingredients that present an
increased risk of toxic effects to neonates or other pediatric subgroups to note such risks in the ``Contraindications,''
``Warnings,'' or ``Precautions'' section of the labeling. If toxicity data for the inactive ingredient(s) do not
exist or are inconclusive, revised &sect;201.57(f)(9)(viii) would not require the labeling to contain a statement
about an increased risk to neonates or other pediatric subgroups. However, in such cases, FDA encourages applicants
to collect and analyze data on inactive ingredients and preservatives that could represent a pediatric risk. These
data may include human data, animal data, or data derived from in vitro models.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA also notes that current regulations already require ANDA applicants whose inactive ingredients differ from
those used in the reference listed drug to identify and characterize the inactive ingredients in a proposed drug product
and to provide information demonstrating that such inactive ingredients do not affect the safety of the proposed
drug product (see 21 CFR 314.94(a)(9)). Given these provisions, there is no reason to believe that the inactive ingredients
used in a generic drug product are any less safe than those in the reference listed drug.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has determined that, for the purposes of this final rule, the terms ``excipient'' and ``inactive ingredient''
have the same meaning. However, because the agency generally uses the term ``inactive ingredient,'' the agency has,
on its own initiative, amended proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(vii) to refer to ``inactive ingredients'' instead
of ``excipients.''

V. Legal Authority
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA's revision to the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of prescription drug labeling is authorized by the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) and by the Public Health Service Act (the PHS act). Section 502(a) of the act prohibits
false or misleading labeling of drugs, including, under section 201(n) of the act, failure to reveal material facts
relating to potential consequences under customary conditions of use. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 502(f) of the act requires drug labeling to have adequate directions for use and adequate warnings against
use by the pediatric population where its use may be dangerous to health, as well as adequate warnings against unsafe
dosage or methods or duration of administration, as are necessary to protect users. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 502(j) of the act prohibits use of drugs that are dangerous to health when used in the manner suggested in their
labeling. Drug products that do not meet the requirements of any paragraph of section 502 of the act are deemed to be
misbranded.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the misbranding provisions, the premarket approval provisions of the act authorize FDA to require
that prescription drug labeling provide the practitioner with adequate information to permit safe and effective
use of the drug product. Under section 505 of the act, FDA will approve an NDA only if the drug is shown to be both safe and
effective for its intended use under the conditions set forth in the drug's labeling. Section 701(a) of the act (21
U.S.C. 371(a)) authorizes FDA to issue regulations for the efficient enforcement of the act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;201.100(d) (21 CFR 201.100(d)) of FDA's labeling regulations, prescription drug products must bear
labeling that contains adequate information under which licensed practitioners can use the drug safely for their
intended uses. Section 201.57 describes specific categories of information, including information for drug use
in selected subgroups of the general population, which must be present to meet the requirements of &sect;201.100.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, under 21 CFR 314.125, FDA will not approve an NDA unless, among other things, there is adequate safety
and effectiveness information for the labeled uses and the product labeling complies with the requirements of part
201 (21 CFR part 201). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 351 of the PHS act provides legal authority for the agency to regulate the labeling and shipment of biological
products. Licenses for biological products are to be issued only upon a showing that they meet standards ``designed
to insure the continued safety, purity, and potency of such products'' prescribed in regulations (42 U.S.C. 262(d)).
The ``potency'' of a biological product includes its effectiveness (21 CFR 600.3(s)). Section 351(b) of the PHS act
prohibits false labeling of a biological product. FDA's regulations in part 201 apply to all prescription drug products,
including biological products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A drug product that is not in compliance with &sect;201.57(f)(9) would be considered misbranded and an unapproved
new drug under the act. A noncomplying product that is a biological product would, in addition, be considered falsely
labeled and an unlicensed biological product under the PHS act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VI. Implementation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary purpose of the proposed rule was to revise the existing pediatric labeling requirements by expanding
the basis on which information about use of a drug in the pediatric population may be included. The proposed rule would
have required sponsors to comply with the pediatric use provisions 1 year after the date of publication of a final rule
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21. Several comments said that the proposed 1-year implementation period was too short. The comments claimed that
extrapolating and reviewing data would be time consuming and that the agency would be unable to approve pediatric
use labeling within 1 year. The comments suggested that the agency cooperate with industry to establish a 3&hyph;year
implementation schedule, only require sponsors to submit revised labeling in 1 year, or make the rule effective in
2 years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has carefully considered the comments and has revised the implementation schedule for the final rule.
The agency will accept pediatric use information based on revised &sect;201.57(f)(9) after January 12, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sponsors have a continuing obligation to maintain labeling that is truthful and comprehensive in accordance with
&sect;201.57, including &sect;201.57(f)(9). Section 201.57(f)(9) requires labeling to contain at least one of
the statements under &sect;201.57(f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(vi), or to propose an alternative statement under
&sect;201.57(f)(9)(vii). The statement must accurately describe available data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sponsors must, therefore, reexamine existing data to determine whether the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the
labeling can be modified based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults and other information supporting
pediatric use, and, if appropriate, submit a supplemental application to comply with new &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv)
by December 13, 1996. A sponsor who does not believe that the disease and drug effects are similar in the pediatric and
adult populations, or who believes that use in pediatric patients is otherwise not adequately supported by data,
should not propose revised labeling under new &sect;201.57(f)(9)(iv), and need not inform the agency of this conclusion.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, FDA expects sponsors to examine available information and update pediatric labeling for their products,
if appropriate. Sponsors should also examine data on the extent and nature of use of their products in pediatric patients.
If FDA concludes that a particular drug is widely used, represents a safety hazard, or is therapeutically important
in the pediatric population, and the drug sponsor has not submitted any pediatric use information, then the agency
may require that the sponsor develop and/or submit pediatric use information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If FDA has made a specific request for the submission of pediatric use information because of expected or identified
pediatric use, and the sponsor fails to provide such information, the agency may consider the product to be a misbranded
drug under section 502 of the act, or a falsely labeled biological product under section 351 of the PHS Act, as well as
an unapproved new drug or unlicensed biological product. (See 21 U.S.C. 355 and 42 U.S.C. 262). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the final rule, any new or revised pediatric indications, or statements on pediatric indications, or statements
on pediatric use under the provisions of &sect;201.57(f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(iv) would require FDA approval
of a supplemental application in accordance with &sect;314.70(b) or &sect;601.12. Other changes to proposed &sect;201.57(f)(9)(ii)
through (f)(9)(iv) to add or strengthen precautions, contraindications, warnings, or adverse reactions or to add
or strengthen dosage and administration instructions to increase a product's safety (for products other than biological
products) could be put into effect at the time a supplement covering the change is submitted to FDA in accordance with
&sect;314.70(c). Minor editorial changes to products other than biological products may be made in accordance with
&sect;314.70(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To comply with this rule, references to ``children'' in the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the insert labeling of
products already being marketed must be changed, where appropriate, to ``Pediatric population'' or ``pediatric
patients.'' The agency advises that after January 12, 1995, such changes must be made, no later than the first time
that labeling is sent to the printers or ordered for reprinting to replenish old stocks of labeling. Such changes for
products other than biological products are considered minor editorial changes and may be submitted in an annual
report in accordance with &sect;314.70(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Any new or revised statement under &sect;201.57(f)(9)(viii) regarding inactive ingredients that may be toxic to
the neonate or other pediatric subgroup should be made in accordance with the provisions of &sect;314.70(c) or &sect;601.12
(21 CFR 601.12), as appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All supplements containing pediatric use information and their mailing covers should be plainly marked ``Pediatric
supplements.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those products subject to section 351 of the PHS act, labeling changes should be made in accordance with &sect;601.12.
Persons who have questions regarding such changes and need guidance on whether a supplement is necessary should contact
one of the following three divisions as appropriate: Office of Therapeutics Research and Review, Division of Application
Review and Policy (HFM&hyph;585), 301&hyph;594&hyph;5109; Office of Vaccine Research and Review, Division of
Vaccine and Related Product Applications (HFM&hyph;475), 301&hyph;594&hyph;2090; or Office of Blood Research
and Review, Division of Blood Applications (HFM&hyph;370), 301&hyph;594&hyph;2012; at the following address:
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, 1401 Rockville Pike, suite 200N, Rockville,
MD 20852.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
22. One comment suggested that the rule would have a substantial economic impact, particularly if the agency adheres
to the proposed 1-year implementation period. The comment said that there are cost factors arising from the extensive
resources required to reevaluate the available clinical study data and literature to extrapolate adult safety data
to the pediatric age group or groups. The comment noted that drug studies in pediatric patients have additional costs
not experienced with the adult population, and may, in some cases, require inpatient studies. The comment also claimed
that encouraging pediatric studies prior to approval or as a Phase 4 commitment could lengthen the development process,
slow drug approval, and thereby have an additional economic impact.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency has considered the comment and has revised the implementation schedule for this final rule. The implementation
schedule is discussed in section VI. of this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency stresses that this rule does not require sponsors to conduct pediatric studies. The authority to require
studies is found in the act and regulations already promulgated. Rather, this rule recognizes alternative methods
of establishing substantial evidence to support pediatric labeling claims. Where a finding of substantial evidence
to support a pediatric indication or a pediatric use statement has not been met for a specific subgroup or for any pediatric
population, the sponsor must instead indicate that no data are available. If a sponsor believes that a pediatric use
statement would be inappropriate or irrelevant to the labeling of a particular drug, it must provide a reason for omitting
the statement. This rule does not affect any determination by the agency that pediatric studies are needed before
or after approval for a new drug.

VII. Environmental Impact
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively
have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental
impact statement is required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Analysis of Impacts
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FDA has examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub.
L. 96&hyph;354). Executive Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory
alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and
equity). The agency believes that this final rule is consistent with the principles set out in the Executive Order.
In addition, the final rule is not a significant regulatory action as defined by the Executive Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant
impact of a rule on small entities. Because the final rule does not impose additional requirements for sponsors to
conduct pediatric studies, the agency certifies that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on
a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, no further analysis is
required.

(9) Pediatric use:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Pediatric population(s)/pediatric patient(s): For the purposes of paragraphs (f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(viii)
of this setion, the terms ``pediatric population(s)'' and ``pediatric patient(s)'' are defined as the pediatric
age group, from birth to 16 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If there is a specific pediatric indication (i.e., an indication different from those approved for adults) that
is supported by adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, it shall be described under the
``Indications and Usage'' section of the labeling, and appropriate pediatric dosage information shall be given
under the ``Dosage and Administration'' section of the labeling. The ``Pediatric use'' subsection shall cite any
limitations on the pediatric indication, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with use of
the drug in any subsets of the pediatric population (e.g., neonates), differences between pediatric and adult responses
to the drug, and other information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. Data summarized in this
subsection of the labeling should be discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ``Clinical Pharmacology''
or ``Clinical Studies'' section. As appropriate, this information shall also be contained in the ``Contraindications,''
``Warnings,'' and elsewhere in the ``Precautions'' sections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If there are specific statements on pediatric use of the drug for an indication also approved for adults that
are based on adequate and well-controlled studies in the pediatric population, they shall be summarized in the ``Pediatric
use'' subsection of the labeling and discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ``Clinical Pharmacology''
and ``Clinical Studies'' sections. Appropriate pediatric dosage shall be given under the ``Dosage and Administration''
section of the labeling. The ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling shall also cite any limitations on the pediatric
use statement, need for specific monitoring, specific hazards associated with use of the drug in any subsets of the
pediatric population (e.g., neonates), differences between pediatric and adult responses to the drug, and other
information related to the safe and effective pediatric use of the drug. As appropriate, this information shall also
be contained in the ``Contraindications,'' ``Warnings,'' and elsewhere in the ``Precautions'' sections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) FDA may approve a drug for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled studies in adults, with other information
supporting pediatric use. In such cases, the agency will have concluded that the course of the disease and the effects
of the drug, both beneficial and adverse, are sufficiently similar in the pediatric and adult populations to permit
extrapolation from the adult efficacy data to pediatric patients. The additional information supporting pediatric
use must ordinarily include data on the pharmacokinetics of the drug in the pediatric population for determination
of appropriate dosage. Other information, such as data from pharmacodynamic studies of the drug in the pediatric
population, data from other studies supporting the safety or effectiveness of the drug in pediatric patients, pertinent
premarketing or postmarketing studies or experience, may be necessary to show that the drug can be used safely and
effectively in pediatric patients. When a drug is approved for pediatric use based on adequate and well-controlled
studies in adults with other information supporting pediatric use, the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling
shall contain either the following statement, or a reasonable alternative: ``The safety and effectiveness of (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
drug name
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) have been established in the age groups _ to _ (note any limitations, e.g., no data for pediatric patients under 2,
or only applicable to certain indications approved in adults). Use of (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
drug name
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
drug name
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in adults with additional data (insert wording that accurately describes the data submitted to support a finding
of substantial evidence of effectiveness in the pediatric population).'' Data summarized in the preceding prescribed
statement in this subsection of the labeling shall be discussed in more detail, if appropriate, under the ``Clinical
Pharmacology'' or the ``Clinical Studies'' section. For example, pediatric pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic
studies and dose-response information should be described in the ``Clinical Pharmacology'' section. Pediatric
dosing instructions shall be included in the ``Dosage and Administration'' section of the labeling. Any differences
between pediatric and adult responses, need for specific monitoring, dosing adjustments, and any other information
related to safe and effective use of the drug in pediatric patients shall be cited briefly in the ``Pediatric use''
subsection and, as appropriate, in the ``Contraindications,'' ``Warnings,'' ``Precautions,'' and ``Dosage and
Administration'' sections. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) If the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pediatric indication or a pediatric use
statement have not been met for a particular pediatric population, the ``Pediatric use'' subsection of the labeling
shall contain an appropriate statement such as ``Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of
(_) have not been established.'' If use of the drug in this pediatric population is associated with a specific hazard,
the hazard shall be described in this subsection of the labeling, or, if appropriate, the hazard shall be stated in
the ``Contraindications'' or ``Warnings'' section of the labeling and this subsection shall refer to it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vi) If the requirements for a finding of substantial evidence to support a pediatric indication or a pediatric use
statement have not been met for any pediatric population, this subsection of the labeling shall contain the following
statement: ``Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.'' If use of the drug in premature
or neonatal infants, or other pediatric subgroups, is associated with a specific hazard, the hazard shall be described
in this subsection of the labeling, or, if appropriate, the hazard shall be stated in the ``Contraindications'' or
``Warnings'' section of the labeling and this subsection shall refer to it. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(vii) If the sponsor believes that none of the statements described in paragraphs (f)(9)(ii) through (f)(9)(vi)
of this section is appropriate or relevant to the labeling of a particular drug, the sponsor shall provide reasons
for omission of the statements and may propose alternative statement(s). FDA may permit use of an alternative statement
if FDA determines that no statement described in those paragraphs is appropriate or relevant to the drug's labeling
and that the alternative statement is accurate and appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(viii) If the drug product contains one or more inactive ingredients that present an increased risk of toxic effects
to neonates or other pediatric subgroups, a special note of this risk shall be made, generally in the ``Contraindications,''
``Warnings,'' or ``Precautions'' section.

 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board or Federal Reserve) is seeking public comment on a proposal
to amend its regulations to include criteria to be used in evaluating the operations of any foreign bank in the United
States that the Board has determined is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated
basis. The Board is required to develop such criteria, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury (Treasury),
and to publish them for public comment pursuant to section 202(e)(7) of the Foreign Bank Supervision Enhancement
Act (the FBSEA or Act).

The Statute
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 202(e)(7) of the FBSEA amended section 7 of the International Banking Act of 1978 (IBA) by adding a requirement
that the Board, in consultation with the Treasury, develop and publish criteria to be used in evaluating the operation
of any foreign bank in the United States that the Board has determined is not subject to comprehensive supervision
or regulation on a consolidated basis. In developing such criteria, the Board is required to allow reasonable opportunity
for public review and comment. 12 U.S.C. 3105(e)(7). In order to implement this statutory provision, the Board is
issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to 12 CFR part 211 of its regulations governing international
banking operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Congress in enacting the FBSEA recognized the importance of the comprehensive, consolidated supervision of
banks operating internationally. The FBSEA strengthened the role of U.S. banking supervisors as the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
host
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 country supervisors of foreign banks operating in this country. The Act also recognized the importance of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
home
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 country supervision in assuring the overall safety and soundness of foreign banks that conduct operations in the
United States by requiring the Board:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. To determine that a foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis by its home country
supervisor in order to establish a new banking presence in this country; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. To establish, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, these criteria in order to evaluate the operation
of any foreign bank in the United States that the Board has determined is not subject to such supervision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As provided in sections 7(e) (1) and (5) of the IBA, as amended, a determination by the Board that a foreign bank is not
subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis is a sufficient ground, in and of itself,
for the Board to require or, in respect of federal branches or agencies, to recommend, termination of the foreign bank's
U.S. operations. 12 U.S.C. 3105(e)(1),(5). Termination of a foreign bank's U.S. operations in these circumstances
is not mandatory, however. Instead, in enacting section 7(e)(7) of the IBA, Congress recognized that there may be
factors in particular cases that militate against termination of a foreign bank's U.S. operations. 12 U.S.C. 3105(e)(7).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All determinations with regard to whether a foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on
a consolidated basis will be made in the context of the supervision and regulation of the foreign bank's existing U.S.
operations. Just as is the case with other supervisory or regulatory determinations, a foreign bank generally will
have an opportunity to provide its views and any information it considers to be relevant in advance of any decision
being made with regard to question of comprehensive, consolidated supervision, unless expeditious action is necessary
to protect the public interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed criteria set out below reflect the factors the Board considers will be relevant for purposes of evaluating
the operations of any foreign bank the Board determines is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation
on a consolidated basis by its home country supervisors in accordance with 12 CFR 211.24(c)(1).

Criteria
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Following a determination by the Board that a foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive, consolidated supervision
by its home country supervisor in accordance with &sect;211.24(c)(1) of Regulation K, the Board proposes to take
into account a number of criteria in reaching a view regarding whether the foreign bank's U.S. operations should be
terminated or permitted to continue, and, if the latter, whether any supervisory constraints should be placed upon
the bank in connection with those operations. These criteria are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The proportion of the foreign bank's total assets and total liabilities that are located or booked in its home country,
as well as the distribution and location of its assets and liabilities that are located or booked elsewhere;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The extent to which the operations and assets of the foreign bank and any affiliates are subject to supervision by
its home country supervisor;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Whether the foreign bank has effective and reliable systems of internal controls and management information and
reporting, which enable management properly to oversee the bank's worldwide operations;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Whether the foreign bank's home country supervisor has any objection to the bank continuing to operate in the United
States;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Whether the foreign bank's home country supervisor and the home country supervisor of any parent of the foreign
bank share material information regarding the operations of the foreign bank with other supervisory authorities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The relationship of the U.S. operations to the other operations of the foreign bank, including whether the foreign
bank maintains funds in its U.S. offices that are in excess of amounts due from the foreign bank's non-U.S. offices;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The soundness of the foreign bank's overall financial condition;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The managerial resources of the foreign bank, including the competence, experience, and integrity of the officers
and directors and the integrity of its principal shareholders;

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
9. The scope and frequency of external audits of the foreign bank; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. The operating record of the foreign bank generally and its role in the banking system in its home country; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The foreign bank's record of compliance with relevant laws, as well as the adequacy of its money laundering controls
and procedures, in respect of its worldwide operations; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The operating record of the U.S. offices of the foreign bank and any affiliates; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. The views and recommendations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC'') or the relevant state
banking regulator regarding the U.S. offices of the foreign bank; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. Whether the foreign bank, if requested, has provided the Board with adequate assurances that such information
will be made available on the operations or activities of the foreign bank and any of its affiliates as the Board deems
necessary to determine and enforce compliance with the IBA, the BHC Act, and other applicable federal banking statutes;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Any other information relevant to the safety and soundness of the U.S. operations of the foreign bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These criteria address factors relating both to the operations of the foreign bank as a whole and to its U.S. operations
in particular. Evaluations of both of these facets of a foreign bank's operations are necessary in order to determine
whether the bank's U.S. operations should be permitted to continue and, if so, whether these operations should be
subject to supervisory constraints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As subsection (c) of proposed &sect;211.30 of Regulation K provides, any foreign bank that the Board determines is
not subject to comprehensive, consolidated supervision may be required to enter into an agreement to conduct its
U.S. operations subject to such restrictions as the Board, having taken into account the criteria, determines to
be appropriate in order to assure the safety and soundness of the bank's U.S. operations. Where appropriate, such
an agreement could require a suitable degree of insulation between the foreign bank's U.S. operations and its operations
(or those of its affiliates) in other countries. For example, one means of accomplishing this would be to require the
bank to conduct its U.S. banking operations in a ``net due to'' position vis-a-vis the rest of the organization. Other
restraints also could be imposed where appropriate (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
restricting transactions with other parts of the organization or requiring that international transactions of
the U.S. offices be conducted through a correspondent acceptable to the Board). Prior to imposing such restrictions,
the Board will consult with the OCC or the appropriate state banking authority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If any requirements imposed in such an agreement were not adhered to, the U.S. banking operations of the foreign bank
would be subject to further enforcement action, including issuance of an order terminating the activities of the
U.S. offices or transmittal of a recommendation to the OCC for such termination, as appropriate in the circumstances.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Request for Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board believes that the proposed criteria will be sufficient to evaluate the safety and soundness of the U.S. operations
of a foreign bank, to determine whether its U.S. operations should be permitted to continue in the absence of comprehensive,
consolidated supervision by the home country authority, and, if so, on what basis. At the same time, the Board does
not wish to impact unduly the existing operations of foreign banks, the vast majority of which are operated in a safe
and sound manner by banks that are subject to a significant degree of supervision by their home country authorities.
The Board, therefore, considers it to be appropriate, in developing the proposed criteria, to take into account the
panoply of tools available to the Board and other banking regulators to regulate the operations of foreign banks that
are not yet subject to full consolidated supervision, which fall short of the ultimate sanction of termination of
their U.S. operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by the Act, the Board has consulted with the Treasury in the development of the proposed criteria and the
Treasury has agreed that the criteria may be published for comment. Further consultation will take place with the
Treasury following the analysis by both agencies of the comments received. The Board requests comment on all aspects
of the proposed criteria.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 29, 1988, OSHA proposed to revise the personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements in the shipyard
employment standards (part 1915, subpart I)(53 FR 48150). This proposal updated references to national consensus
standards and added requirements for hazard assessment, proper selection and care of PPE, training, lifesaving
equipment and personal fall protection. The written comment period ended on February 27, 1989. The Agency received
10 comments on the proposed rule, and one hearing request, which was withdrawn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 16, 1989, OSHA proposed to update the existing general industry standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket
S&hyph;060) for eye and face (&sect;1910.133), head (&sect;1910.135) and foot (1910.136) PPE and to add generic
requirements for hazard assessment, proper selection of PPE, prohibition on use of damaged or defective PPE and training
in the proper use of PPE, &sect;&sect;1910.132(d) through (f) (54 FR 33832).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 10, 1990, the Agency proposed to add criteria for personal fall arrest equipment (&sect;1910.128, 1910.129
and 1910.131) and positioning device equipment (&sect;&sect;1910.128 and 1910.130) to the general industry PPE
standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket S&hyph;057)(55 FR 13423).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two general industry rulemakings generated extensive rulemaking records, including hundreds of comments and
several thousand pages of hearing testimony.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On April 6, 1994, OSHA issued a final rule (59 FR 16334) which completed Agency action in the general industry PPE proceeding.
Based on the rulemaking record, (59 FR 16334, Docket S&hyph;050), OSHA made some changes to the proposed rule in drafting
the final rule. In particular, OSHA revised the proposed training requirements to provide clear requirements for
what is adequate training and what circumstances trigger retraining. In addition, the final rule added requirements
for certification that the required hazard assessment (&sect;1910.132(d)(2)) and training (&sect;&sect;1910.132(f)(4))
had been performed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, based on the general industry rulemaking record (Docket S&hyph;057), the Agency is considering whether it
should revise the proposed rule for general industry fall protection PPE to further limit or to prohibit the use of
body belts and non-locking snap hooks in personal fall arrest systems. In a related rulemaking for fall protection
in the construction industry, OSHA recently issued a final rule (59 FR 40672, August 9, 1994) which prohibits the use
of body belts and nonlocking snap hooks in personal fall arrest systems after December 31, 1997.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the substance of the OSHA standards for general industry (part 1910), shipyard (part 1915)
and construction employment (part 1926) should be consistent where possible. OSHA believes that PPE used in shipyard
employment does not differ markedly from PPE used in general industry, and that the standards covering PPE use should
not differ markedly either.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Agency recognizes that work activities in shipyard employment often differ from those in other industries,
the Agency believes that much of the information generated in the general industry rulemakings will help the Agency
draft the final rule for shipyard PPE. To this end, OSHA formally incorporated the general industry PPE rulemaking
records (Dockets S&hyph;057 and S&hyph;060) into the record for the shipyard employment PPE rulemaking (59 FR 34586,
July 6, 1994).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In that same notice, OSHA reopened the written comment period for the shipyard employment PPE rulemaking to provide
the public with an opportunity to comment on the newly incorporated general industry materials and on five specific
issues (certification of hazard assessment; certification of training; training elements; body belts and body
harnesses; and locking and non-locking snaphooks). The comment period, which ended August 22, 1994, elicited 13
comments, including one hearing request. These comments generally opposed any revision to proposed 1915 subpart
I based on the 1910 subpart I records.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on these submissions, OSHA is convening a public meeting to seek additional input regarding all issues raised
therein with emphasis on the issues set out below. OSHA solicits further input regarding how the incorporation of
the provisions discussed in the July 6, 1994 notice of reopening would impact the shipyard industry. The Agency also
requests that interested parties provide input regarding any experience they have had with the implementation of
such provisions.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Issue 1_Certification of Hazard Assessment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed part 1915 subpart I would require that employers select PPE for their employees based on an assessment of
the pertinent workplace hazards (proposed &sect;1915.152(b)). For example, shipyard maintenance workers, in
general, are required to wear hard hats, safety glasses and safety shoes. Maintenance workers who are exposed to airborne
concentrations of asbestos that exceed the PELs, are also required to wear full-body clothing, gloves and foot coverings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed provision did not specifically address documentation of the hazard assessment. The revised PPE standard
for general industry requires that affected employers verify that they have assessed workplace hazards through
a written certification. As discussed in the July 6, 1994 notice, the Agency has been considering whether it would
be appropriate to require written certification of hazard assessments in shipyards, as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commentor (Ex. 9&hyph;2) said that such a certification provision required the approval of the Office of Management
and Budget (OMB), pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act and the implementing regulations. Other comments (Exs.
9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;7, 9&hyph;8 and 9&hyph;10) stated that OSHA should take a performance-oriented approach to documentation
of hazard assessments, instead of adopting the general industry written certification requirement. In particular,
a commentor (Ex. 9&hyph;7) stated ``certification of hazard assessment requirements should be based on employees'
duties that tend to be constant rather than on the shipyard work place that is neither fixed, nor constant, nor readily
quantifiable like work places in all other industries.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, one commentor (Ex. 9&hyph;11) stated that hazard certification is unnecessary, because that company
has ``a good hazard assessment program that addresses PPE. A properly trained Compliance Officer can make a fair determination
concerning PPE.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those commentors indicated that requiring hazard assessments for each job, if followed literally, would create
considerable costs for shipyard employers, without increasing employee safety. Those commentors also stated that
requiring employers to certify their hazard assessment activities would increase shipyard operational costs and
paperwork burdens, with no safety benefit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on those comments, OSHA requests input regarding the appropriateness of a documentation requirement; the
manner in which shipyards currently document their hazard assessments; and suggested language for a verification
requirement that would address concerns specific to shipyard employment. In particular, the Agency solicits information
regarding hazard assessment programs currently in use in shipyards and experience concerning the effectiveness
of such programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Agency is considering the extent to which current hazard assessments performed by trade or occupation
provide the necessary information for selection of appropriate PPE. The following are examples of typical trade-based
hazard assessment formats that OSHA may consider to be acceptable:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on an assessment of the workplace hazards to which welders are exposed, the equipment listed below is the basic
PPE required for this occupation. This does not take into account a job location in which additional PPE may be required
such as where the welder works from an elevated platform without guard rails. In this situation the welder must wear
the proper fall protection equipment, such as a body harness.

Based on an assessment of the workplace hazards to which shipyard maintenance workers are exposed, the equipment
listed below is the basic PPE required for this occupation. Where maintenance workers are exposed to other hazards,
such as asbestos exposure where the insulation on a pipe is being repaired, the maintenance worker must be provided
with the appropriate supplemental PPE (requirements for asbestos PPE are set out in &sect;1915.1001).

Proposed &sect;1915.152(d) required that employees be trained in the proper use of their personal protective equipment.
The proposal did not address certification of training nor did it address specific training elements. The revised
PPE standard for general industry requires employees to be trained and retrained, as necessary, in at least the following:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This training may be provided in a variety of ways, such as through tool box training or at safety meetings. Once this
training has been completed, &sect;1910.132(f)(4) requires employers to verify through a written certification
that each affected employee has received and understood the required training. This certification requirement
may be satisfied through a training log or other document that the employer has already been using to keep track of its
training activities. For compliance purposes, a record which provides the names of the employees who have successfully
completed the training, the date of the training, the type of certification (that is, completion of PPE training),
and the signature of a supervisor or trainer would be sufficient. OSHA solicits additional information concerning
whether it is appropriate to clarify the requirements of proposed &sect;1915.152(d) by incorporating the above-noted
training elements and whether the Agency should add a new requirement for written certification of training. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the notice of reopening, OSHA received comments (Exs. 9&hyph;6, 9&hyph;8 and 9&hyph;9) which stated
that training can be satisfied during new employee orientation. Another commentor (Ex. 9&hyph;7) supported OSHA's
intent for general requirements for training. The commentor also believed that ``documentation of all training
should be in the form of training logs, which would be the equivalent of ``written certification'' to avoid the non-value
added redundance of record keeping.'' In addition, a commentor (Ex. 9&hyph;9) stated that most shipyards are already
complying with the OSHA PPE training standard under consideration. Most of the shipyards that responded to the notice
of reopening stated that they already have a written certification program and a new hire training program in effect.
One commentor (Ex. 9&hyph;11) stated that requiring employers to certify their training activities would increase
shipyard operational costs and paperwork burdens, with no safety benefit.

Issue 3_Body Belts and Body Harnesses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed part 1915 subpart I would allow the use of personal fall arrest systems with either body belts or body harnesses,
but would limit the impact load allowed for body belts to one-half of that allowed for body harnesses (900 pounds as
opposed to 1800 pounds). The July 6, 1994 notice stated that OSHA was considering whether the part 1915 subpart I final
rule should bar the use of body belts for fall protection. Some commentors (Exs. 9&hyph;1, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;7 and
9&hyph;8) suggested that there is no basis for barring the use of body belts for fall arrest and that the load limits
set in the proposed rule were appropriate. In particular, the South Tidewater Association of Ship Repairers and Newport
News Shipbuilding (Exs. 9&hyph;3 and 9&hyph;11) stated that requiring employers to dispose of body belts and to purchase
body harnesses would impose unreasonable financial burdens. Those commentors also stated that a review of their
records showed no injuries that would have been prevented by having employees wear body harnesses instead of body
belts; that belts had greater ease of use; and that the cost of harnesses was approximately double that of body belts.
On the other hand, Tampa Shipyard (Ex. 9&hyph;8), Atlantic Marine (Ex. 9&hyph;9), and General Dynamics (Ex. 9&hyph;10)
stated that they already employ body harnesses in their personal fall arrest systems. Tampa Shipyards and Atlantic
Marine stated that the use of body harnesses was cost effective, even though harnesses could cost twice as much as body
belts, because the additional safety factor provided by harnesses was worth the investment. In addition, General
Dynamics (Ex. 9&hyph;10) stated that its systems already comply with the general industry criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, OSHA promulgated a revised fall protection standard for construction, part 1926 subpart M (59 FR 40672,
August 9, 1994), which prohibits the use of body belts in personal fall arrest systems after December 31, 1997. After
that time, construction employees may use body belts only with positioning device systems. The Agency has found,
as follows:

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The evidence in the record clearly demonstrates that employees who fall while wearing a body belt are not afforded
the level of protection they would be if the fall occurred while the employee was wearing a full body harness. In addition,
[a commentor] presented evidence of injuries resulting from the use of body belts. The best available evidence the
Agency has at this time indicates that the Agency should ban the use of body belts after a reasonable period. This will
allow employers to phase out their existing inventory.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OSHA seeks input regarding the extent to which a phased in ban on the use of body belts in personal fall arrest systems
would be appropriate for shipyard employment. Please provide information on the useful life of body belts currently
in use or on the market, the impact loads imposed on employees who fall while wearing such body belts, the cost of the
body belts and body harnesses that are currently available, along with other data which would help OSHA address this
issue.

I. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Title IV of SMCRA established an Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) program for the purposes of reclaiming and
restoring lands and water resources adversely affected by past mining. This program is funded by a reclamation fee
imposed upon the production of coal. As enacted in 1977, lands and waters eligible for reclamation were those that
were mined or affected by mining and abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977,
and for which there was no continuing reclamation responsibility under State or Federal law. The AML Reclamation
Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, Title VI, Subtitle A, Nov. 5, 1990, effective Oct. 1, 1991) amended SMCRA, 30 U.S.C.
1231 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to provide changes in the eligibility of project sites for AML expenditures. The Secretary adopted AML regulations
(59 FR 28136, May 31, 1994) at 30 CFR Subchapter R, Parts 795, 870, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876, and 886 to implement this act.
Title IV of SMCRA now provides for reclamation of certain mine sites where the mining occurred after August 3, 1977.
These include interim program sites where bond forfeiture proceeds were insufficient for adequate reclamation
and sites affected any time between August 4, 1977, and November 5, 1990, for which there were insufficient funds for
adequate reclamation due to the insolvency of the bond surety. Title IV provides that a State with an approved AMLR
program has the responsibility and primary authority to implement the program.

The Secretary of the Interior approved the Missouri AMLR Plan on January 29, 1982. Information pertinent to the general
background of the Missouri AMLR Plan submission, as well as the Secretary's findings and the disposition of comments
can be found in the January 29, 1982,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary adopted regulations at 30 CFR Part 884 that specify the content requirements of a State reclamation
plan and the criteria for plan approval. The regulations provide that a State may submit to the Director proposed amendments
or revisions to the approved reclamation plan. If the amendments or revisions change the scope of major policies followed
by the State in the conduct of its reclamation program, the Director must follow the procedures set out in 30 CFR 884.14
in approving and disapproving an amendment or revision.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated November 29, 1994, (Administrative Record No. AML&hyph;MO&hyph;89) Missouri submitted a proposed
amendment to its AML Plan pursuant to SMCRA. Missouri submitted the proposed amendment in response to a letter from
OSM dated September 26, 1994 (Administrative Record No. AML&hyph;MO&hyph;88), in accordance with 30 CFR 884.15(b)
concerning revisions to the AML regulations at 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter R (59 FR 28136, May 31, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Missouri proposes to amend its statutes at RSMo Section 444.810, Powers of Commission-abandoned mine reclamation
fund created, purpose as well as RSMo Section 444.915, Abandoned mine reclamation fund-deposits and expenditures.
Missouri proposes to amend its regulations at 10 CSR 40&hyph;9.020 (1) and (3), Reclamation-General Requirements.
Missouri proposes to amend its AML Plan at Section 884.13(c)(2), project ranking and selection procedures and Section
884.13(d)(3), purchasing and procurement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The addition of subsections (D) and (E) make additional lands eligible for reclamation activities where the coal
mining site was left: (1) either unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed between August 4, 1977, and November 21, 1980,
where funds or other financial guarantees are not sufficient to provide or adequate reclamation or abatement at the
site; (2) either unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed between August 4, 1977, and November 5, 1990, and the surety
of such mining operator became insolvent during such period, and as of November 5, 1990, remaining funds or other financial
guarantees are not sufficient to provide for adequate reclamation or abatement at the site; (3) the site meets priority
objectives stated in subsections (4) (A) and (B) of this rule. Priority will be given to those sites which are in the
immediate vicinity of a residential area or which have an adverse economic impact upon a community; and (4) monies
available from sources outside the fund or which are ultimately recovered from responsible parties involving lands
eligible pursuant to (1)(D) of this rule, shall either be used to offset the cost of the reclamation or transferred
to the fund if not required for further reclamation activities at the permitted site. The definition of left and abandoned
in either an unreclaimed or inadequately reclaimed condition is revised to be consistent with these changes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The AMLR Plan is revised to require the submittal of the Abandoned Mine Land Problem Area Description Form (OSM 76).
This form will be utilized in identifying problem area priorities and submitted to OSM upon project completion to
report actual reclamation accomplishments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AMLR Plan is revised to ensure that certain interim sites and insolvent surety sites mined after August 3, 1977,
may be eligible for AML funding. Additional ineligible sites would include sites and areas designated for remedial
action pursuant to the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 7901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) or that have been listed for remedial action pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601

Missouri is adding provisions that restrict the eligibility of bidders and their subcontractors on AML contracts:
(1) to any bidder or equipment supplier whose firm or affiliate is not listed in the General Services Administration
publication entitled Lists of Parties Excluded from Federal Procurement or Nonprocurement Programs; and (2) must
be eligible to receive a permit or conditional permit to conduct surface coal mining operations as confirmed by OSM's
Applicant/Violator System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Missouri also adds a provision that AML State Share funds may be requested annually for the Future Reclamation Set-Aside
Program. The funds would only be utilized to accomplish the purposes of P.L. 95&hyph;87 and only withdrawn after September
30, 1995. A separate accounting system would be utilized for these funds.

(4) RSMo 444.810.2&hyph;8. Joint Committee on Administrative Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Missouri requires that any rules promulgated under the authority of the Land Reclamation Commission shall not become
effective until it has been approved by the joint committee on administrative rules. Missouri adds these subsections
to provide the procedures necessary for this review and approval process.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Missouri revises this subsection to require that AML fund monies may be used if there is no continuing reclamation
responsibility under State or Federal laws for lands or water. Eligibility is defined in one of three ways: (1) as lands
and water affected by coal mining, wastebanks, coal processing or other coal mining processes and abandoned or left
in an inadequate reclamation status prior to September 28, 1979; (2) A finding must be made that the mining operation
occurred between August 4, 1977, and November 21, 1980, and that available funds are insufficient for adequate reclamation
or abatement; or (3) A finding may also be made that the mining operation occurred between August 4, 1977, and October
1, 1991, and that the surety became insolvent during that period and that available funds are not sufficient for adequate
reclamation or abatement.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If only one person requests an opportunity to testify at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing,
may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting

IV. Procedural Determinations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance With the National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since agency decisions on proposed State and Tribal abandoned
mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof are categorically excluded from compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332) by the Manual of the Department of the Interior (516 DM 6, appendix 8, paragraph
8.4B(29)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance With Executive Order No. 12291
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSM an exemption from sections 3, 4, 7, and 8 of Executive
Order 12291 for actions related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatory programs, actions, and program
amendments. Therefore, preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not necessary and OMB regulatory review is
not required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial
number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). The State submittal, which is the subject of this rule, is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which
an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic
effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have
a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Compliance With Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined
that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments
since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA
(30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs
and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is
consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730,
731, and 732 have been met.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
At the request of the Greater Lafourche Port Commission, the Coast Guard is considering a change to the regulation
governing the operation of the following two drawbridges across Lafourche Bayou, in Lafourche Parish, Louisiana:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The State Route 1 (Galliano-Tarpon) vertical lift span bridge, mile 30.6 at Cutoff, Louisiana; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The State Route 1 (Cote Blanche) pontoon bridge, mile 33.9 at Cutoff, Louisiana.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation would require that the bridges open on signal; except that from 2 to 3 p.m. and from 4:30 to 5:30
p.m., Monday through Friday, other than Federal holidays, the bridges would be permitted to remain closed to navigation
for the uninterrupted crossing of peak vehicular and school bus traffic. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Presently, the draws of the bridges are required to open on signal at all times.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action would relieve traffic congestion on the bridges during these periods and permit the timely return of school
children to their homes while still providing for the reasonable needs of navigation.

Background and Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Greater Lafourche Port Commission has requested the regulation because vehicular traffic crossing the bridges
during the proposed closure periods has increased dramatically during recent years and school children are delayed
from returning home from their classes in a timely manner. The new proposed regulation would allow for the free flow
of vehicular traffic, while still serving the reasonable needs of navigational interest.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion of Proposed Rules
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Galliano ``Tarpon'' bridge is a vertical lift span structure. Navigational clearances provided by the bridge
are 3.0 feet vertical above mean high water in the closed to navigation position and 73 feet above mean high water in
the open to navigation position. Horizontal clearance is 80.0 feet. Navigation on the waterway consists of tugs with
tows, fishing vessels, occasional small oil field work boats and recreational craft. Data provided by the Greater
Lafourche Port Commission show that from August 1993 through August 1994, the number of vessels that passed the bridge
totaled 1141 for the year. This breaks down to about 95 vessels per month or 3.1 vessels per 24-hour period. Vehicular
traffic that passes over the bridge during the proposed closure period from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. averages about 750 vehicles
including 4 school busses. An additional 4 school busses cross the bridge between 3 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. and these busses
will be able to adjust their schedule to arrange to cross the bridge during the 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. closure. Vehicular traffic
that crosses the bridge during the proposed closure period of 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. averages approximately 780.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Cote Blanche bridge is a pontoon bridge. There is no vertical clearance in the closed to navigation position and
unlimited clearance in the open to navigation position. The same type of navigation that passes the Galliano ``Tarpon''
bridge, also passes the Cote Blanche bridge. The average vessel passage per 24 hour period is 3.1. Vehicular traffic
that passes over the Cote Blanche Bridge during the proposed closure period from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. average about 380,
including 3 school busses. An additional 10 school busses cross the bridge between 3 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. and these busses
will be able to adjust their schedule to cross during the 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. closure. Vehicular traffic that crosses the
bridge during the proposed closure period of 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. averages approximately 485.

Regulatory Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require
an assessment of potential cost and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office
of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the
Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under
paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Small Entities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations
that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions
with populations of less than 50,000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the proposed rule also considers the needs of local commercial fishing vessels, the economic impact is expected
to be minimal. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to approve the State implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Montana with a letter
dated March 2, 1994. This submittal addresses the Federal Clean Air Act requirement to submit contingency measures
for both particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

) and for carbon monoxide (CO) for the areas in Missoula designated as nonattainment for the PM

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
and CO National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Further, this submittal satisfies several commitments made
by the State in a previous PM
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=2 -->
10 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
SIP submittal. Due to the completion of those commitments, EPA is proposing to approve the related rules of the Missoula
City-County Air Pollution Control Program, as adopted by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences
on June 28, 1991 and amended on March 20, 1992 and November 19, 1993, and submitted by the Governor in letters dated August
20, 1991, June 4, 1992, and March 2, 1994. These rules include regulations regarding inspections, emergency procedures,
minor source construction permits, open burning, and wood waste burners. EPA also proposes to approve minor revisions
to previously approved Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program Chapters VII and VIII, as included in
the March 2, 1994 submittal. Further, EPA declines to take action on Missoula's minor source operating permit regulations.
Finally, EPA proposes to disapprove Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's Chapter X, Variances.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is acting on the State's SIP revisions as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this
as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for EPA's actions
is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further
activity is contemplated and the direct final rule will become effective. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct
final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on
this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting
on this document should do so at this time.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA or Agency) proposes to make determinations of base (100-year) flood
elevations and modified base flood elevations for each community listed below, in accordance with section 110 of
the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and 44 CFR 67.4(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These proposed base flood and modified base flood elevations, together with the floodplain management criteria
required by 44 CFR 60.3, are the minimum that are required. They should not be construed to mean that the community must
change any existing ordinances that are more stringent in their floodplain management requirements. The community
may at any time enact stricter requirements of its own, or pursuant to policies established by other Federal, state
or regional entities. These proposed elevations are used to meet the floodplain management requirements of the NFIP
and are also used to calculate the appropriate flood insurance premium rates for new buildings built after these elevations
are made final, and for the contents in these buildings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Associate Director, Mitigation Directorate, certifies that this proposed rule is exempt from the requirements
of the Regulatory Flexibility Act because proposed or modified base flood elevations are required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, 42 U.S.C. 4104, and are required to establish and maintain community eligibility in the National
Flood Insurance Program. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis has not been prepared.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 48 CFR Parts 219 and 252 provide regulatory coverage
incorporating two standard clauses giving small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns a ten percent evaluation
preference in competitive acquisitions where award is based on price and price related factors. The Defense Logistics
Agency Regulation (DLAR) 48 CFR parts 5419 and 5452, as proposed in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
of April 28, 1994 (59 FR 21954) would provide regulatory coverage incorporating two nonstandard clauses in domestic
bulk petroleum solicitations and contracts concerning small business set-asides and evaluation preference for
SDB concerns into DLAR on a permanent basis. These two DFARS and two DLAR clauses concern preferential consideration
for SDBs under small business set-asides and the ten percent evaluation preference for SDB concerns on unrestricted
procurements. Comments are hereby requested on the proposed DFARS and DLAR coverage, which reduces the SDB preference
from ten to five percent. The proposed coverage is being published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 because it is expected to have an effect beyond the internal operating procedures of DLA, and in some cases, may have
a modest impact on contractors.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Section 1207 of Public Law 99&hyph;661, as amended, sets a goal for the Department of Defense to award five percent
of contract performance dollars to SDB concerns, historically black colleges, and universities, and minority institutions.
To achieve this goal, the law permits the payment of contract prices up to 10 percent above fair market price. The implementing
DFARS coverage includes an across-the-board evaluation factor of 10 percent. Offers from non-SDB concerns on unrestricted
procurements are increased by adding an evaluation factor of ten percent to their offers (evaluation preference).
On partial small business set-asides, the DFARS permits award to SDB concerns at prices up to ten percent above the
highest non-set-aside award price (preferential consideration). Decreasing the percentage from ten to five percent
will save taxpayers at least $3 million a year, while continuing to provide SDB firms an opportunity to participate
in fuel procurements and allowing DLA to continue meeting the 5 percent SDB award goal.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This deviation may have a modest impact on a few SDB fuel suppliers. However, the proposed rule is not expected to have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
since the projected SDB award percentages in the two most affected fuels programs should only be decreased by one-tenth
of a percent or less. An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments are
invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities concerning the affected
DFARS sections will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately
and cite this case in correspondence.

does not exceed the highest award price on the non-set-aside portion by more than 5 percent, as adjusted for transportation
charges and other factors. If the SDB price exceeds the highest non-set-aside price by more than 5 percent, the SDB
offer will be treated as a small business and the procedures set forth in (d) below will apply.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (the Act), Pub. L. 103&hyph;355, provides the authority to streamline
the acquisition process and minimize burdensome requirements unique to the Federal Government. Major changes that
can be expected in the acquisition process as a result of the Act's implementation include changes in the areas of Commercial
Item Acquisition, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Truth in Negotiations Act, and introduction of the Federal
Acquisition Computer Network.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice announces FAR revisions developed under FAR case 94&hyph;754, based on Section 2101 of the Act that (1)
adds to the list of unallowable costs found at 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1), the costs of lobbying the legislative body of a
political subdivision of a state; (2) adds to the list found at 10 U.S.C. 2324(f)(1) of costs to be clarified in the cost
principles, the cost of ``conventions''; and (3) expands the coverage to the Coast Guard and the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. Section 2151 amends 41 U.S.C. 256 to include all the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2324, as amended
by Section 2101. Therefore, the provisions are made generally applicable to all other executive agencies. The new
FAR language, with only minor variations, was transferred from the current coverage in the Defense Federal Acquisition
Regulations (DFARS).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAR Council is interested in an exchange of ideas and opinions with respect to the regulatory implementation of
the Act. For that reason, the FAR Council is conducting a series of public meetings. However, the FAR Council has not
scheduled a public meeting on this rule (FAR case 94&hyph;754) because of the clarity and non-controversial nature
of the rule. If the public believes such a meeting is needed with respect to this rule, a letter requesting a public meeting
and outlining the nature of the requested meeting shall be submitted to and received by the FAR Secretariat (see ADDRESSES

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
caption, above) on or before January 12, 1995. The FAR Council will consider such requests in determining whether
a public meeting on this rule should be scheduled.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, because most contracts awarded to small businesses are awarded through sealed bidding on a firm fixed price basis.
The cost principles apply only to contracts which are not firm fixed price. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered
in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

(3) Notwithstanding the reference to geographical area in 31.205&hyph;6(b)(1), under 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1)(M)
and 41 U.S.C. 256(e)(1)(M), the costs of severance payments to foreign nationals employed under a service contract
or subcontract performed outside the United States are unallowable to the extent that such payments exceed amounts
typically paid to employees providing similar services in the same industry in the United States. Further, under
10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1)(N) and 41 U.S.C. 256(e)(1)(N), all such costs of severance payments which are otherwise allowable
are unallowable if the termination of employment of the foreign national is the result of the closing of, or the curtailment
of activities at, a United States facility in that country at the request of the government of that country; this does
not apply if the closing of a facility or curtailment of activities is made pursuant to a status-of-forces or other
country-to-country agreement entered into with the government of that country before November 29, 1989. 10 U.S.C.
2324(e)(3) and 41 U.S.C. 256(e)(2) permit the head of the agency, or designee, to waive these cost allowability limitations
under certain circumstances (see 37.113 and the clause at 52.237&hyph;XXX).

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA proposes to revise the training and qualification requirements for certain air carriers and commercial operators
by: (1) Requiring certain certificate holders operating under part 135, and permitting certain others, to comply
with part 121 training, checking, and qualification requirements, and (2) mandating Crew Resource Management (CRM)
training requirements for part 121 and certain part 135 operators. The FAA has proposed these rules in order to make
some part 135 training requirements as comprehensive as part 121 requirements and to incorporate recent knowledge
about human performance factors. The proposed rule would also allow certain part 135 certificate holders to take
advantage of sophisticated aircraft simulator training technologies presently available to part 121 certificate
holders. By increasing the training and qualification requirements for certain operators, the proposed rule is
expected to reduce the risk of accidents and incidents. By mandating CRM training for certificate holders required
to comply with part 121 training requirements, the proposed rule is expected to reduce the number of accidents and
incidents that could be attributed to a lack of crew communication and coordination.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Federal Aviation Regulations in parts 121 and 135 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations contain rules which
specify training program requirements for air carriers and certain commercial operators. Those rules specify the
qualification requirements of crewmembers, flight and simulator instructors, check airmen, aircraft dispatchers,
and other operations personnel. The most detailed and rigorous training and qualification requirements are those
contained in subparts N and O of part 121. Although subparts N and O have been amended a number of times in recent years,
most of the amendments concern the use of simulators, training devices, or specific training requirements such as
security and the transportation of hazardous materials. No comprehensive changes have been made to these subparts
since December 1969.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA's most immediate concerns regarding the training and qualification regulations in part 121 and part 135 are
twofold. First, compared to part 121 training regulations, part 135 training regulations do not provide a balanced
mix of training and checking. Second, current parts 121 and 135 training regulations do not incorporate recent knowledge
about the significance of human performance factors (e.g., communication, decision-making, leadership, management)
in safe flight operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In December, 1986, in response to a Safety Recommendation from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB),
the FAA specifically addressed the human factors training issue by initiating an aviation behavioral technology
program. This ongoing program consists of projects that, among other things, increase the use of line operational
simulations (LOS) to improve cockpit/cabin communication and coordination skills, and pilot decision-making
skills.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June 1988, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendation A&hyph;88&hyph;71 concerning CRM training. The NTSB issued
the recommendation as a result of a Northwest Airlines crash on August 16, 1987, in which 148 passengers, 6 crewmembers,
and 2 people on the ground were killed. The NTSB noted that both pilots had received single-crewmember training during
their last simulator training and proficiency checks and the last CRM training they had both received was 3.5 hours
of ground school (general) CRM training in 1983. The NTSB implied that the accident might have been prevented had the
flight crew received adequate CRM training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After soliciting ideas from other government agencies and from the aviation community, the FAA published a proposed
Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) and accompanying draft advisory circular (AC) in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(54 FR 7670, February 22, 1989). These documents proposed a voluntary, alternative method of complying with the training
requirements in current regulations. The voluntary alternative training is called an ``advanced qualification
program'' (AQP). After considering comments received, the FAA issued a final SFAR 58, Advanced Qualification Program,
and an accompanying advisory circular (55 FR 40262, October 2, 1990). This voluntary program applies to certificate
holders operating under part 121 or part 135 who elect the alternative requirements of AQP which includes CRM training
and evaluation, increased use of LOS, use of training centers, and the evaluation of flight training devices and flight
simulators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To date, the larger and more sophisticated air carriers have taken advantage of the voluntary program. The FAA expects
this to be the case for the foreseeable future. The FAA recognizes that many operators, particularly smaller operators,
may be unable to take advantage of the voluntary program. Since these operators will elect not to participate in the
voluntary AQP program and will instead comply with current training requirements in parts 121 and 135, the FAA proposes
to amend the current training requirements of parts 121 and 135 to address the most immediate concerns regarding improved
aircrew training and qualification standards. In particular, all certificate holders operating under part 121,
and those certificate holders operating under part 135 who are authorized or required to follow part 121 training
and qualification requirements, would be required to include CRM in their training programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another recommendation from other government agencies and the aviation community was that commuter air carriers
conducting operations under part 135 with airplanes that require two pilot crewmembers should also be required to
comply with the training, checking, and qualification requirements of part 121. Many regional air carriers operate
under both parts 121 and 135. The Regional Airline Association, on December 10, 1991, petitioned the FAA for an exemption
to allow its members to train, check, and qualify their pilots under part 121 rather than under part 135. The FAA granted
exemption No. 5450 on May 8, 1992, and now over 60% of those certificate holders that operate under both parts 121 and
135 have obtained approval to train, check, and qualify their pilots pursuant to part 121.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has issued two NPRM's that are relevant to this rulemaking. Notice No. 92&hyph;10 (57 FR 35888, August 11, 1992)
relates to the use of training centers by certificate holders who do not elect to come under an AQP. The second NPRM,
Notice No. 93&hyph;1 (58 FR 15730, March 23, 1993), is of particular importance to those certificate holders who operate
under part 135 that would be affected by the mandatory requirements of this proposal. If the pilot operating and experience
requirements proposed in Notice No. 93&hyph;1 are adopted, the new crew pairing and consolidation of knowledge and
skills requirements would apply to those part 135 operators who are required or who elect to comply with the requirements
of subparts N and O of part 121. Therefore, affected part 135 certificate holders are invited to consider the applicability
of Notice No. 92&hyph;10 and Notice No. 93&hyph;1 to their operations when commenting on this notice. By this notice,
the FAA is not reopening the comment period for those NPRM's. The FAA could adopt the proposals in those NPRM's and still
consider whether to apply those provisions to part 135 certificate holders in this proposed rulemaking.

General Applicability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendments to part 121 would apply to all certificate holders operating under part 121 and to certain
certificate holders operating under part 135 who would be required to comply with the part 121 training qualification
requirements. The proposed requirements would also apply to certain part 135 certificate holders if they apply for
and receive FAA authorization to comply with the part 121 training and qualification requirements.

Commuter Operations Conducted Under Part 135
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Part 135 commuter operations serving small and medium sized communities carry millions of passengers every year.
The Regional Airline Association (RAA), whose membership consists primarily of commuter air carriers, estimates
that more than 61 million passengers will be carried by RAA member airlines in 1997. Comprehensive training requirements,
including CRM training, are important to the safety of these operations. Part 121 training would benefit these operations
because it provides more emphasis on training, whereas current part 135 rules rely more heavily on the testing and
checking requirements set forth in subparts G and H of part 135. Part 121 also allows greater use of simulators resulting
in two benefits:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Under &sect;121.407(c), simulator training can be substituted for repetitive proficiency checks (&sect;121.441)
and certain recency requirements (&sect;121.439). This allows for greater flexibility and a more effective mix
of training and checking activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Simulator training may include hazardous scenarios that would be imprudent to be included in inflight training.
This also increases pilot proficiency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments to &sect;&sect;121.431, 135.3, 135.241, 135.291, and 135.321(a) require the following
certificate holders conducting commuter operations under part 135 to comply with the training, checking, and qualification
requirements of part 121, subparts N and O, in place of the requirements of subparts E, G, and H of part 135: (1) Those
that conduct commuter operations with airplanes for which two pilots are required by aircraft type certification
rules, and (2) those that conduct commuter operations with airplanes having a passenger seating configuration,
excluding any pilot seat, of 10 seats or more.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``commuter operations'' will apply to both intrastate and interstate operations with the frequency of operations
set forth in the definition of ``Commuter Air Carrier'' in SFAR 38&hyph;2. Thus, intrastate operations as described
above with a frequency of operations described in SFAR 38&hyph;2's definition of ``commuter air carrier'' would
also be subject to the proposals in this NPRM.

The proposed rule also allows the Administrator to authorize any other certificate holders that conduct operations
under part 135 to comply with the training, checking, and qualification requirements of subparts N and O of part 121.
These operations would include commuter operations using aircraft that do not meet the criteria outlined above and
all unscheduled operations conducted under part 135. However, because of the size and scope of these operations,
the FAA proposes to permit these certificate holders to comply with the operating experience requirements in &sect;135.244
instead of those in &sect;121.434.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each certificate holder operating under part 135 that would be required under proposed &sect;135.321(b) to comply
with the training and qualification requirements of part 121, subparts N and O, would also be required to submit and
obtain FAA approval of a transition plan converting from part 135 to the part 121 training and checking requirements.
In the proposed plan the certificate holder should address issues such as: (1) whether currently employed crewmembers
need additional training to meet minimum part 121 training and qualification requirements; and (2) whether and how
the certificate holder's training curriculum will be modified to meet part 121 requirements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although not part of the transaction plan, the proposed change to &sect;121.405 would also require certain part 135
certificate holders to modify their training program manual contents. Under proposed &sect;121.405(g) a certificate
holder may request a reduction in the programmed hours of ground training from the minimum hours required under present
&sect;121.419. A reduction may be warranted in cases where a certificate holder shows that the airplanes it operates
under part 135 are less complex than those generally operated under part 121.

Crew Resource Management (CRM) Training
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A major objective of this proposed rule is to require all certificate holders operating under part 121 and certain
certificate holders operating certain airplanes under part 135 to provide CRM training. Over the last decade, a number
of air carrier incidents and accidents have been attributed, in part, to the lack of CRM skills (e.g., communication,
decision-making, leadership, management). Over the last decade 24 part 121 accidents were reported by the NTSB as
having resulted, in part, from CRM-related causes. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) studies
over the last ten years indicate more than 60% of fatal air carrier accidents were not directly linked to mechanical
failure or lack of pilot skills, but rather to human error. These NASA studies emphasize a training deficiency in areas
related to human performance factors, such as poor group decisionmaking, ineffective communication, inadequate
leadership, and poor task and resource management. The NTSB's study, ``A Review of Flightcrew-involved Major Accidents
of U.S. Air Carriers 1978 through 1990,'' states ``a comprehensive CRM program is one tool an air carrier can use to
improve both decisionmaking and monitoring/challenging by crewmembers.'' Since 1990 the NTSB has issued two safety
recommendations (A&hyph;89&hyph;124 and A&hyph;93&hyph;37) that recommend that CRM training be added to crewmember
training programs. For a list of FAA and NASA publications and reports and related research findings and publications,
see AC 120&hyph;51A, as amended, ``Crew Resource Management Training.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, certain events may occur during flight where the activities of flight crewmembers and flight attendants
must be coordinated. One of the prerequisites for crew coordination is effective communication between all crewmembers.
In a 1986 survey of safety representatives and flight attendants, only 37% of the flight attendants and 60% of the pilots
said that they thought communication between the flight crew and cabin crew was adequate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Similarly, clear communication between aircraft dispatchers and flight crewmembers is essential to flight safety.
Poor communication between dispatchers and the flight crew may jeopardize flight safety.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRM training teaches crewmembers and aircraft dispatchers to use effectively all resources available to the crew
(e.g. hardware, software, and all persons involved in aircraft operation) to achieve safe and efficient flight operations.
Proposed amendments to &sect;&sect;121.404, 121.419(a)(1), 121.421(a)(1), 121.422(a)(1), and 121.427(b)(4)
require that each ground training portion of an approved training program provide approved CRM training to flight
crewmembers, flight attendants, and aircraft dispatchers. If this NPRM becomes a final rule, part 135 certificate
holders who would be required or who successfully obtain FAA authorization to conduct training under part 121 would
also be required to provide CRM training as part of their approved training programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA anticipates that for a CRM training program to be approved it would include three distinct components: (1)
An indoctrination/awareness component during which CRM issues are defined and discussed; (2) a recurrent practice
and feedback component during which trainees gain experience with CRM techniques; and (3) a continuing reinforcement
component which ensures that CRM principles are addressed throughout the trainee's employment with the certificate
holder. Advisory Circular (AC) 120&hyph;51, as amended, ``Crew Resource Management Training,'' and AC 121&hyph;XX,
``Dispatcher Resource Management Training'' provide basic guidance in establishing approved CRM training. (In
this notice, the term ``CRM'' includes both crew resource management and dispatcher resource management.) DOT/FAA/RD&hyph;92&hyph;26,
``Crew Resource Management: An Introductory Handbook,'' goes into further detail.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposed &sect;121.404 includes initial CRM training for persons already employed by the certificate holder, and
for new employees of the certificate holder, unless a new employee has completed the applicable initial CRM training
from another certificate holder. The FAA anticipates that this component will be very similar for all certificate
holders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRM initial indoctrination/awareness training is a curriculum segment with a variety of instructional methods,
which can include lectures, discussions, films, practice in an operational setting or a LOS session, and feedback
with a facilitator. CRM initial indoctrination/awareness training must be provided to all crewmembers, including
flight attendants, and to aircraft dispatchers; this training is in addition to existing training. Under proposed
&sect;121.406, the FAA may credit some CRM/DRM training received before the compliance date in the proposed rule.
Some operators have been providing CRM/DRM training under AQP or under voluntary programs. In appropriate circumstances,
the FAA may credit part or all of such training toward the initial ground CRM/DRM training which would be required by
proposed sections 121.419, 121.421, and 121.422.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The recurrent practice and feedback component of CRM training is best accomplished through the use of simulators
and video equipment. However, if the use of simulators is not practical, CRM scenarios can be created without simulators
and practice can be tape recorded to provide feedback. Feedback should be directed by a facilitator who has had appropriate
CRM training. Practice and feedback provide participants with self and peer critiques to improve communication,
decision-making, and leadership skills.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA would approve a recurrent training program under proposed &sect;121.427 that included CRM recurrent practice
and feedback and continuing reinforcement training components, and a refresher curriculum segment in the principles
of CRM. Ideally, for flight crewmembers continuing reinforcement may be accomplished, as authorized in proposed
&sect;121.427(b)(4), during an approved simulator line operational flight training (LOFT) session. This could
include use of special purpose operational training (SPOT) which is a type of line operational simulation (LOS) that
may be used to train coordinated crew performance in specific subjects such as windshear training, use of special
navigation equipment, etc. CRM reinforcement may be incorporated into existing SPOT scenarios. It may also be incorporated
into LOS-like scenarios that do not use simulators. Advisory Circular (AC) 120&hyph;35B, Line Operational Simulators:
Line Oriented Flight Training, Special Purpose Operational Training, Line Operational Evaluation, provides suggested
guidelines for the design and implementation of LOS. Recurrent CRM training will be provided to all crewmembers and
aircraft dispatchers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that the proposed CRM training requirement will increase the present minimum programmed hours
of instruction for initial and recurrent training. For initial training for pilots and flight engineers, the FAA
estimates that CRM training will add 12 hours to present requirements. For initial training for flight attendants
and aircraft dispatchers, the increase is estimated to be 8 hours. For recurrent training, the estimated increase
is 4 hours for pilots and flight engineers and 2 hours for flight attendants and aircraft dispatchers. To reflect these
estimated increases in programmed hours of training, changes are proposed to &sect;&sect;121.419(b) (1) and (2),
121.421(c) (1) and (2), 1212.422(c) (1) and (2) and 121.427(c). The FAA invites comments on these estimates and, if
adequate justification is received, will consider reducing the increases in minimum required hours in the final
rule. In this regard, the FAA points out that under existing regulations (i.e., &sect;121.405(d)) individual certificate
holders may be granted reductions in programmed hours when justified under that paragraph. When the Administrator
approves a request to reduce programmed hours of training, a copy of the Administrator's statement is included in
the training program curriculum pursuant to &sect;121.403(b)(6).

Effective Date and Compliance Dates

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is proposing an effective date of 90 days after these proposals are published as a final rule. By that date certificate
holders operating under part 135 who are required to comply with applicable part 121 training and qualification requirements,
would have to submit the transition plan required under proposed &sect;135.321(b). The proposed compliance date
in &sect;135.10 for training and qualifying under part 121 rules is 1 year after the effective date of the final rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For initial CRM training, the FAA proposes a compliance date 2 years after the effective date of the final rule for flight
crewmembers, and 3 years after the effective date of the final rule for flight attendants and aircraft dispatchers.
After the applicable date, a certificate holder would be prohibited from using a crewmember or dispatcher unless
that person has completed approved crew or dispatcher resource management initial training. Since a large number
of certificate holder employees are required to have this training, the delayed compliance date will allow sufficient
time to train instructors conducting CRM training, and then, in turn, provide this training to all crewmembers and
dispatchers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Regulatory Evaluation Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs
that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits
of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to
analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs
agencies to assess the effect of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA
has determined that this proposed rule would generate benefits that justify its costs and does not meet the criteria
of ``a significant regulatory action'' as defined in the Executive Order but is significant under the Department
of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures. The proposal would not have a significant impact on a substantial
number of small entities. And, the proposal would not constitute a barrier to international trade. These analyses,
available in the docket, are summarized below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section discusses costs of the new requirements that this NPRM would impose on parts 121 and 135 operators. The
regulatory evaluation assumes a 7 percent discount rate as mandated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
The analysis also uses a 6 percent growth rate for commuters and a 4 percent growth rate for air carriers for the next
decade. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new hire rate affects the amount of initial training required. This rate varies widely within the industry depending
on economic cycles, birth and death of airline companies, and long-term industry growth. The FAA has developed two
cost estimates. The first uses a 10 percent and the second a 20 percent new hire rate. Costs for a single year refer to
those using a 20 percent new hire rate (the higher of the two costs), while for the total 10 year costs the analysis shows
a range representing the difference between the 10 percent and 20 percent new hire rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each operator will incur a small administrative effort related to establishing these new requirements within its
existing training program. The FAA estimates that operators on average will incur a one time burden of about 8 hours
of administrative time. This relatively small burden is subsumed in the non-wage training costs.

The proposed rule would require part 121 training standards for part 135 crewmembers of airplanes either certificated
for two pilots or having 10 or more passenger seats. The amendment exempts currently employed part 135 pilots and flight
attendants from initial and transitional part 121 training. However, it imposes a recurrent training requirement
on currently employed crewmembers to meet part 121 qualifying standards during their first recurrent training.
New crewmembers under part 135 would receive initial part 121 training.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many commuter airlines already train their cockpit crew at a level comparable to part 121 operators. Primarily, this
group consists of those airlines where the carrier operates aircraft under both parts 121 and 135. The FAA estimates
that the proposed rule would affect 3,400 employees: 1,100 pilots-in-command (PICs), 1,400 second-in-command
officers (SICs), and 900 flight attendants who work for strictly part 135 operators. The hourly wage rate (including
benefits) equals $43 for PICs, $28 for SICs, and $23 for flight attendants who work for the regional airlines. Travel
and per diem expenses equal $250 per round trip and training expense totals $90 a day.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For 1995, initial and transitional training costs for part 135 crewmembers would increase by about $1.9 million;
first year recurrent cost of training (expected to be more extensive than later recurrent training) would increase
by $3.0 million. Recurrent training cost after the first year would increase by $2.1 million. For the period 1994 through
2003, the discounted incremental cost to part 135 operators ranges from $27.1 (10 percent new-hire rate) to $35.7
million (20 percent new-hire rate).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM would require parts 121 and 135 operators affected by the proposal to train all crewmembers in cockpit resource
management (CRM). Although the proposed rule would provide some flexibility in curricula design, an FAA-approved
CRM training program would include: (1) Awareness of CRM issues where aspects of the problem are discussed; (2) practice
and feedback where crewmembers learn CRM techniques; and (3) reinforcement where CRM principles are strengthened.

Part 121 CRM Training Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that part 121 personnel requiring CRM equals about 32,600 pilots-in-command; 33,900 copilots,
10,000 flight engineers, 84,000 flight attendants; and 1,100 dispatchers. Under the proposed rule, the FAA projects
that PICs, SICs, and flight engineers would receive 12 hours of CRM awareness training and 4 hours annually of CRM refresher
training. Flight attendants and dispatchers would receive 8 hours initial and 2 hours of recurrent training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For PICs, SICs, and flight engineers, the proposal would require CRM awareness training within two years of the effective
date of the proposed rule; for flight attendants and dispatchers, it would require completion within three years.
All crewmembers would receive recurrent CRM training annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of pilots undergoing initial training in the two-year phase-in equals the total number of pilots plus new
hires. The hourly wage rate (including benefits) used in this analysis equals $55 for PICs, $38 for SICs, $38 for flight
engineers, $27 for flight attendants, and $18 for dispatchers. The initial training during the first two years would
cost approximately $55 million each year. Initial training would amount to about $10 million annually after the two-year
phase-in period. Recurrent training would total about $32 million annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial training for flight attendants and dispatchers over the three-year phase-in period would total $17 million.
Initial and recurrent training for flight attendants and dispatchers after the third year would be $4 million and
$17 million, respectively
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Over the period 1995 through 2004, the discounted cost for part 121 CRM training ranges from $473 (10 percent new hire
rate) to $569 million (20 percent new hire rate).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates that the NPRM would require CRM for 3,360 commuter airline flight crewmembers. CRM awareness training
would cost $300 for 12 hours of PIC and SIC training and $200 for 8 hours of flight attendant training.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As in the case of the part 121 CRM training, the proposed rule would require CRM awareness flight crew training within
two years of the effective date of the rule; for flight attendants, the proposed rule would require completion within
three years. All crewmembers would receive annual recurrent CRM training. The hourly wage rate (including benefits)
used in this analysis equals $43 for PICs, $28 for SICs, and $14 for flight attendants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 135 CRM awareness training for the two-year phase-in period under the NPRM would cost $1.6 million, and after
the second year the training would cost $0.5 million annually. Recurrent CRM commuter pilot instruction would cost
$0.7 million annually.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CRM awareness training for part 135 flight attendants would cost $0.4 million annually for the three-year phase-in
period. The cost would total $64,000 per year, thereafter. Recurrent training would cost approximately $137,000
annually. Over the decade, CRM training would the industry cost would range from $9.5 (10 percent new hire rate) to

The proposed rule would improve aviation safety by upgrading training standards for pilots flying part 135 aircraft
either certified for two pilots or having 10 or more passenger seats. Also, the NPRM would instruct air carrier (part
121) and commuter (part 135) crews in CRM techniques. This summarizes the analysis of benefits from this training.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
During 1982 through 1992, pilot error was a probable cause in 39 accidents involving part 135 aircraft of the type affected
by this proposal. These accidents caused 93 fatalities and 55 serious injuries. During this same period, commuter
operators flew 41.15 million flights resulting in a commuter accident rate due to pilot error of .9478 accidents per
million commuter flights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projected benefits equal the product of the accident rate times projected flights times the average cost of pilot-error
accidents. For instance, in 1994 the estimated value of benefits equals:

If the proposed rule could reduce the pilot-error accident rate to zero, the total value over the period 1995 through
2004 would total $418 million. The discounted value of these benefits equals $289 million. However, at most the rule
would reduce the part 135 pilot-error accident rate down to the rate sustained by part 121 operators.

The FAA estimates the pilot-error accident rate for part 121 pilots to equal 0.7 accidents per million flights. Since
the pilot-error accident rate for part 135 operators equals 0.9478 accidents per million, the proportion of available
benefits for part 135 flights equal just over one-fourth accident per million flights [((0.9478^0.7)/0.9478))=0.26].
Also reducing the available benefits, the commuter operators would not complete training for two years. Hence, the
estimated value of the benefits of this proposed rule totals $62 million.

During the period 1982 through 1992, 13 part 135 accidents resulted from crew coordination problems, resulting in
an accident rate of 0.158 per million flights. These accidents resulted in 85 fatalities, 35 serious injuries, and
43 minor injuries. The average benefit value of avoiding an accident including fatalities, injuries, value of aircraft,
and accident investigation costs equals $19.545 million.

Between 1982 and 1992, there were 23 part 121 air carrier accidents reported by NTSB that resulted, in part, from CRM-related
causes. These accidents caused 324 fatalities and 91 serious injuries. The part 121 CRM accident rate equals 0.3938
accidents per million flights.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimated the value of potential benefits by multiplying the part 121 CRM accident rate by the number of flights
times the average value per accident. The CRM benefits for 1995, for instance, equal:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the next 10 years, the FAA projects the discounted value of benefits is $619 million. However, about one-third
of part 121 pilots (those not in AQP) will begin training in 1995 and airlines would finish training in late 1996. The
estimated potential benefits for part 121 CRM training equals $581 million.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Benefits from upgrading part 135 flight crew training to the part 121 level would result in a reduction in pilot-error
commuter accidents. The FAA estimates that the expected benefits of this provision would total $62 million over the
next decade. This evaluation estimates that the discounted training costs for large part 135 operators would increase
anywhere from $27 to $36 million. Hence, the FAA concludes that the benefits of this provision exceed its costs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA calculates the discounted benefits from requiring CRM training for part 121 personnel to equal $581 million.
The estimated additional cost to airlines would range from $473 to $569 million over the decade. Hence, the FAA determines
that this proposed provision is cost beneficial.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA estimates the benefits from requiring CRM training for part 135 personnel to equal $98 million over the next
decade. The cost of training would range from an additional $9 to $12 million for part 135 operators. Hence, the FAA
determines that this requirement is cost beneficial.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each provision of this proposal has potential benefits in excess of expected costs. Hence, the FAA concludes that
the proposal is cost beneficial.

International Trade Impact

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPRM would have small impact on U.S. air carriers that foreign air carriers would not have to bear. The FAA estimates
a total of 6.2 billion total enplanements with a total of CRM training over the next 10 years of about $581 million. Hence,
the per emplanement cost over the next 10 years for part 121 carriers increases by about $0.09 per enplanement.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily
and disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have
``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule would affect those small entities regulated by parts 121 and 135. The FAA's criteria for ``a substantial
number'' are a number that is not less than 11 and which is more than one-third of the small entities subject to the proposed
rule. For air carriers, a small entity has been defined as one who owns, but does not necessarily operate, 9 aircraft
or less. The relevant FAA criteria for ``a significant impact'' is an incremental cost of $61,000 per year for a scheduled
air carrier with a fleet size of 60 seats or fewer, and $110,100 for a scheduled air carrier with aircraft fleet size
of more than 60 seats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has identified 35 part 121 operators who operate 9 or fewer aircraft. The FAA assumes that an average crew size
consists of one pilot-in-command, one second-in-command, and three flight attendants. The FAA also assumes that
operators employ two crews per plane.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that annualized CRM training for each aircraft would amount to $6,120 annually. This estimate includes
initial training and recurrent training averaged over the decade for a crew of two pilots (PIC and SIC) and four flight
attendants. The analysis assumes three crews per aircraft and a 20 percent turnover. Hence, the expected CRM training
cost will not exceed $55,080 (9 times $6,120). This cost falls below the ``significant impact'' threshold cost of
$110,100. Hence, CRM training costs would not impose a significant burden on a substantial number of small part 121
operators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventy-three part 135 scheduled operators affected operate 9 or fewer aircraft. The FAA estimates an annualized
cost of $13,180 for part 135 training upgrade for crewmembers for one aircraft; CRM would carry an annualized cost
of $4,000. The total training costs equal $17,180 ($13,180 + $4,000). This estimate assumes three crews per aircraft
with each crew consisting of a PIC, a SIC, and two flight attendants. This estimate includes initial training and recurrent
training averaged over the decade and a 20 percent markup for turnover. Training costs for small entities with 4 to
9 aircraft would exceed the threshold (4 &times; $17,180 = 68,720). However, FAA data shows 16 scheduled part 135 operators
of the type affected by this NPRM that operate between 4 and 9 aircraft. Since the number of companies represents about
22 percent of the 73 operators affected by this proposed rule, the FAA concludes that the proposed rule would not have
a significant economic impact on a significant number of small part 135 scheduled operators.

Federalism Implications
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed regulations do not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national
government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government.
Thus, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that such a regulation does not have federalism implications
warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the reasons set forth under the heading ``Regulatory Analysis,'' the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation:
(1) is a significant rule under Executive Order 12866; and (2) is a significant rule under Department of Transportation
Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Also, for the reasons stated under the headings
``Trade Impact Statement'' and ``Regulatory Flexibility Determination,'' the FAA certifies that the proposed
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A copy of the full regulatory
evaluation is filed in the docket and may also be obtained by contacting the person listing under

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are advising the public that three environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the issuance or renewal of permits to allow the field
testing of genetically engineered organisms. The environmental assessments provide a basis for our conclusion
that the field testing of these genetically engineered organisms will not present a risk of introducing or disseminating
a plant pest and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Based on its findings of
no significant impact, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that environmental impact
statements need not be prepared.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The regulations in 7 CFR part 340 (referred to below as the regulations) regulate the introduction (importation,
interstate movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms and products that are
plant pests or that there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before
a regulated article may be introduced into the United States. The regulations set forth the procedures for obtaining
a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the
release into the environment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has stated
that it would prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before
issuing a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the course of reviewing each permit application, APHIS assesses the impact on the environment that releasing the
organisms under the conditions described in the permit application would have. APHIS has issued permits for the field
testing of the organisms listed below after concluding that the organisms will not present a risk of plant pest introduction
or dissemination and will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment. The environmental
assessments and findings of no significant impact, which are based on data submitted by the applicants and on a review
of other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental
impacts associated with conducting the field tests. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental assessments and findings of no significant impact have been prepared by APHIS relative to the issuance
or renewal of permits to allow the field testing of the following genetically engineered organisms:

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 13, 1992, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) received a petition from the Upjohn Company
(Upjohn) and its subsidiary, Asgrow Seed Company, of Kalamazoo, MI, seeking a determination that the ZW&hyph;20
virus resistant squash line no longer be considered a regulated article under APHIS' regulations in 7 CFR part 340.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 4, 1992, APHIS announced the receipt of the Upjohn petition in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (57 FR 40632&hyph;40633, Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;1) and announced its intent to issue an interpretive ruling
that the ZW&hyph;20 virus resistant squash does not present a plant pest risk and, therefore, would no longer be considered
a regulated article. That notice also requested comments on APHIS' proposed interpretive ruling. After considering
the 17 comments submitted during the 45-day comment period, of which 7 were in support of the petition and 10 in opposition,
APHIS determined that it was in the public interest to reopen the comment period to seek additional comment on several
scientific and technical issues raised by the commenters. The commenters expressed concerns in three major areas:
(1) Will the introduction of the two viral coat protein genes increase the likelihood of the creation of new plant viruses;
(2) could the introduction of two virus resistance genes cause squash to become a weed; and (3) would the virus resistance
genes move to wild squash relatives and would this have a detrimental impact on these wild plants? A notice was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 22, 1993 (58 FR 15323, Docket No. 92&hyph;127&hyph;2), to reopen the comment period for an additional 60 days.
Twelve comments were received, of which 10 were in support and 2 were in opposition. The same major areas of concern
expressed during the first comment period were again reflected in the two comments in opposition to the petition,
with the addition of a statement that an environmental impact statement should be prepared in connection with commercial
scale growth of the ZW&hyph;20 squash. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the date of the original submission of Upjohn's petition, APHIS has formalized, under a ``Petition for Determination
of Nonregulated Status'' (

the original petition for the ZW&hyph;20 squash was submitted.

(EA) and preliminary finding of no significant impact (FONSI) related to the proposed determination of nonregulated
status for the ZW&hyph;20 squash, a public meeting in Washington, DC, on July 21, 1994, and a 45-day comment period
ending July 7, 1994. The notice included the text of the preliminary FONSI that had been prepared by APHIS.

At the public meeting on June 21, 1994, two speakers presented comments. One commenter supported the EA and preliminary
FONSI; the other did not support the EA and preliminary FONSI. Both speakers also submitted written comments. During
the 45-day comment period, APHIS received an additional 52 written comments from private individuals, universities,
agricultural experiment stations, the cooperative extension service, public interest groups, industry, a trade
association, and a Federal research laboratory. Twenty-three comments supported APHIS' findings in the EA and preliminary
FONSI. Twenty-nine comments disagreed with APHIS' proposal to approve the Upjohn petition, while 23 were in favor
of approval. The commenters in opposition to the petition again stressed concerns about the ecological safety of
commercial scale growth of the ZW&hyph;20 squash, citing such risks as gene glow to wild squash, potential impacts
on squash centers of diversity, the potential for increased weediness in wild squash, and the risk of creating new
viruses. APHIS has prepared a detailed technical analysis of, and response to, those comments in the determination
document, which is available upon request from the individual listed under

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 L. cultivar YC77E ZW&hyph;20) (ZW&hyph;20) developed by Upjohn resists infection by two plant viruses, zucchini
yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) and watermelon mosaic virus, type II (WMV2). ZW&hyph;20 squash was developed by engineering
two plant virus genes, the coat protein (CP) genes of ZYMV and WMV2, into a line of yellow crookneck squash. In addition,
the vector system used to transfer the viral CP genes into the recipient squash was derived from the bacterial plant
pathogen 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Agrobacterium tumefaciens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Certain noncoding regulatory sequences were derived from plant pathogens, i.e. from 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
A. tumefaciens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and from cauliflower mosaic virus and cucumber mosaic virus. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ZW&hyph;20 squash has been considered a regulated article under the APHIS regulations in 7 CFR part 340 in part
because of the use of CP genes, in part because of the derivation of the vector system, and in part because of use of noncoding
regulatory sequences from plant pathogens. Field testing of the ZW&hyph;20 squash has been conducted since 1990
at approximately 46 field sites in 10 States under 14 permits issued by APHIS. All field trials have been performed
under conditions of reproductive confinement. Field data reports indicate no deleterious effects on plants, nontarget
organisms, or the environment from these field tests.

Determination 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on an analysis of the information and data submitted by Upjohn, a review of scientific literature, and comments
received from the public, APHIS has concluded that the ZW&hyph;20 squash is as safe to grow as traditionally bred virus
resistant squash. The available evidence indicates that ZW&hyph;20 squash: (1) Exhibits no plant pathogenic properties;
(2) is no more likely to become a weed than a virus resistant squash plant developed by traditional breeding techniques;
(3) is unlikely to increase the weediness potential for any other cultivated plant or native wild species with which
it can interbreed; (4) should not cause damage to processed agricultural commodities; (5) should not increase the
likelihood of the emergence of new plant viruses; and (6) is unlikely to harm other organisms, such as bees, which are
beneficial to agriculture. The basic findings of the preliminary FONSI are therefore adopted in support of the determination
that Upjohn's ZW&hyph;20 squash does not present a plant pest risk and therefore will no longer be considered a regulated
article under APHIS' regulations in 7 CFR part 340. The effect of this determination is that the permit requirements
of 7 CFR part 340 will no longer apply to the field testing, importation, or interstate movement of ZW&hyph;20 squash
or its progeny. Importation of ZW&hyph;20 squash and nursery stock or seeds capable of propagation is still, however,
subject to any restrictions found in the Foreign Quarantine Notice regulations at 7 CFR part 319.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Thunderbolt Wildfire burned a total of 27,000 acres of Boise and Payette National Forest system lands in the fall
of 1994. The Forests intend to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Thunderbolt wildfire area to assess
and disclose the environmental effects of opportunities designed to improve long-term fish habitat, rehabilitate
existing sediment sources, improve hydrologic conditions of affected watersheds, and protect long-term soil productivity.
These objectives would be accomplished through road surfacing, revegetation of road cut and fill slopes, and drainage
improvements on existing roads; planting of conifers and shrubs; and salvaging dead and dying trees as a means to finance
the preceding opportunities. Timber harvest would be done by helicopter, and designed to result in minimal ground
disturbance and risk of erosion and no sediment delivery to streams.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In the fall of 1994, the Chicken, Thunderbolt, and portions of the Corral and Blackwell wildfires burned in excess
of 150,000 acres in the South Fork Salmon River drainage of the Payette and Boise National Forests in central Idaho.
A broadscale analysis team and several landscape analysis teams are using an ecosystem based approach to assess the
fires' effects and identify management opportunities that could be implemented to move the postfire landscapes
toward a desired ecological condition. The Payette National Forest is currently assessing the impacts and potential
opportunities associated with the Corral, Blackwell and Chicken wildfires which may result in separate Notices
of Intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The primary management emphasis in the South Fork Salmon River drainage is restoration of harvestable, robust, self-sustaining
populations of naturally reproducing salmon and trout. The South Fork Salmon River was historically the single largest
producer of summer chinook salmon in the Columbia River Basin. Since the 1950's this run has declined significantly,
partially due to habitat degradation caused by management-induced sediment. The species is currently listed as
endangered. Prime spawning habitat occurs within and/or adjacent to the Thunderbolt wildfire landscape. Numerous
road-related sediment sources continue to deliver sediment to streams. Annual sediment delivery is expected to
increase as a result of the fires.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Burn intensities in the Thunderbolt wildfire area varied considerably. Within the fire perimeter, approximately
6,000 acres burned at high intensity, 9,000 acres at moderate intensity, and 4,000 acres at low intensity. Approximately
8,000 acres inside the fire perimeter did not burn.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are an estimated 18,000 acres burned within Inventoried Roadless Areas (IRAs). The IRAs affected are Caton
Lake and Meadow Creek.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fire burned adjacent to or within the river corridors of Johnson Creek (eligible for Recreation classification)
and South Fork Salmon River, which are both pending Wild and Scenic River study.

Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The objective for the Proposed Action is to improve long-term fish habitat, rehabilitate existing sediment sources,
improve hydrologic conditions of affected watersheds, protect long-term soil productivity, promote regeneration
of trees on burned acres, and recover the economic value of fire-killed and imminently dead trees as a means of financing
activities related to the preceding objectives.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Proposed Action includes the following components:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Activities designed to rehabilitate existing sediment sources.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Harvest economically feasible fire-killed timber and imminently dead trees from areas outside of the Riparian Habitat
Conservation Areas (draft PACFISH criteria) and the Wild and Scenic eligible corridor of the South Fork Salmon River.
Large snags would be retained in varying amounts thoughout the harvest areas for dependent wildlife, long-term soil
productivity, large woody debris recruitment, shade to assist tree regeneration, and aesthetics. To protect watersheds
and fish habitat, helicopter yarding systems are proposed for use in the salvage effort of 3,500 acres. Four helicopter
landings would need to be constructed to supplement the existing roads and landings needed to facilitate harvest
activities. No new road construction is proposed. Additional road reconstruction may be identified during analysis
as necessary to improve watersheds or fish habitat.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Protection measures for streams would be based on the science utilized to develop the interim direction contained
in the draft PACFISH EA. The direction issued with the final PACFISH EA and Decision Notice would be incorporated as
necessary.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methodologies, rationale and findings associated with the landscape analysis and site specific environmental
analysis would be reviewed by a proposed panel of experts elected from Forest Service research and system branches,
and other federal agencies. Recommendations made by this panel could be used by line officers in directing the environmental
analysis, formulating alternatives, disclosing environmental consequences, developing a monitoring plan and
making the final decision. This may include the option of not moving ahead with any or part of the action alternatives
if conclusive information shows that the action would be damaging to anadromous fish.

Forest Plan Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Boise and Payette National Forest Land and Resource Management Plans have specific management direction for
the South Fork Salmon River Area. The overall goal is to restore harvestable, robust, self-sustaining populations
of naturally reproducing salmon and trout. The Thunderbolt Wildfire Recovery Proposed Action is designed to improve
fish habitat and is consistent with the objectives and goals of both Forest Plans. Prior to making a NEPA decision,
a thorough examination of all standards and guidelines of both Forest plans would be completed and if necessary, plan
amendments would be addressed in the EIS.

Preliminary Issues
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Anticipated concerns with the Proposed Action are; (1) Ground disturbing activities may increase sediment delivery
to streams and degrade fish habitat, and (2) salvage harvesting in IRAs and the potential effect it may have on the wilderness
attributes of the area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Possible Alternatives to the Proposed Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two alternatives to the Proposed Action have been identified. A No Action alternative, and an alternative that would
exclude salvage harvesting in the IRAs. Other alternatives may be developed as issues are raised and information
is received.

Draft Environmental Impact Statement, February, 1995. Final EIS, April, 1995. Implementation, July, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Past experience with wildfire timber recovery efforts on the Boise and Payette National Forests have proven that
prompt action is required to recover the economic value of fire-killed trees. The trees, mostly Douglas-fir, subalpine
fir, and lodgepole pine, are expected to lose more than half of their economic value by the fall of 1995. Recovered timber
values would be used to finance beneficial watershed improvement projects designed to improve fish habitat.

The Forest Service believes, at this early stage, it is important to give reviewers notice of several court rulings
related to public participation in the environmental review process. First, reviewers of Draft Environmental Impact
Statements must structure their participation in the environmental review of the proposal so that it is meaningful
and alerts an agency to the reviewer's position and contentions.

in this proposed Action participate by the close of the 45 day comment period so that substantive comments and objections
are made available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final
environmental impact statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To assist the Forest Service in identifying and considering issues and concerns on the Proposed Action, comments
on the Draft Environmental Impact Statement should be as specific as possible. It is also helpful if comments refer
to specific pages or chapters of the draft statement. Comments may also address the adequacy of the Draft Environmental
Impact Statement or the merits of the alternatives formulated and discussed in the statement. Reviewers may wish
to refer to the Council on Environmental Quality Regulations for implementing the procedural provisions of the National
Environmental Policy Act at 40 CFR 1503.3 in addressing these points.

Preliminary Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We preliminarily determine that disposable pocket lighters from the People's Republic of China (PRC) are being,
or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as provided in section 733 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (the ``Act''), as amended. The estimated margins of sales at less
than fair value are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.

Case History 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the initiation of this investigation on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 29412, June 7, 1994), the following events have occurred:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 23, 1994, the United States International Trade Commission (``ITC'') issued an affirmative preliminary
injury determination (see ITC Investigation No. 303&hyph;TA&hyph;25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On June 13, 1994, we sent a letter to the China Chamber of Commerce for Machinery and Electronic Products Import and
Export (``CCCME'') requesting names and addresses of PRC producers and exporters of disposable pocket lighters
(``lighters'') sold in the United States. On June 22, 1994, we received a list of producers and exporters of lighters
from the CCCME. A questionnaire was presented on July 1, 1994, to the CCCME and to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (``MOFTEC'') for distribution to PRC producers and exporters of lighters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 20, 1994, we postponed the preliminary determination until December 5, 1994 (59 FR 48284). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 9, 1994, responses to the Department's questionnaire were received from the following exporters of
lighters: China National Overseas Trading Corporation (Ningbo) (``COTCO''), Guangdong Light Industrial Products
Import and Export (``GLIP''), Gao Yao (Hong Kong) Hua Fa Industrial Company, Ltd. (``Gao Yao''), PolyCity Industrial,
Ltd. (``PolyCity''), and Cli-Claque Company Limited (``Cli-Claque''). On October 12 and 18, 1994, we sent supplemental/deficiency
questionnaires to the respondents. Responses to the supplemental questionnaires were received on November 14,
1994. On November 23, 1994, petitioner alleged critical circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The products covered by this investigation are disposable pocket lighters, whether or not refillable, whose fuel
is butane, isobutane, propane, or other liquified hydrocarbon, or a mixture containing any of these, whose vapor
pressure at 75 degrees fahrenheit (24 degrees celsius) exceeds a gage pressure of 15 pounds per square inch. Non-refillable
pocket lighters are imported under subheading 9613.10.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States
(``HTSUS''). Refillable, disposable pocket lighters would be imported under subheading 9613.20.0000. Although
the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of
this proceeding is dispositive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Windproof refillable lighters, as described in a memorandum to Barbara R. Stafford, dated December 5, 1994, are excluded
from the scope of this investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Period of Investigation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The period of investigation (``POI'') is December 1, 1993 through May 31, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Nonmarket Economy Country Status 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has treated the PRC as a nonmarket economy country (``NME'') in all past antidumping investigations
(see, e.g., Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Saccharin from the PRC (59 FR 58818, November
15, 1994). No information has been provided in this proceeding that would lead us to overturn our former determinations.
Therefore, in accordance with section 771(18)(c) of the Act, we have treated the PRC as an NME for purposes of this investigation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the Department is investigating imports from an NME, section 773(c)(1) of the Act directs us to base foreign
market value (``FMV'') on the NME producers' factors of production, valued in a market economy that is at a level of
economic development comparable to that of the NME under investigation and that is a significant producer of comparable
merchandise. Section 773(c)(2) of the Act alternatively provides that where available information is inadequate
for using the factors of production methodology, FMV may be based on the export prices for comparable merchandise
from market economy countries at a comparable level of economic development. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For purposes of the preliminary determination, we have relied on the methodology provided by section 773(c)(1) of
the Act to determine FMV. The sources of individual factor prices are discussed in the FMV section below.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Separate Rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All five respondents have requested separate antidumping duty rates. In cases involving non-market economies,
the Department's policy is to assign a separate rate only when an exporter can demonstrate the absence of both 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 governmental control over export activities. In determining whether companies should receive separate rates,
we focus our attention on the exporter rather than the manufacturer, as our concern is manipulation of export prices,
and we examine PRC government control of the exporter. In this case, two of the five respondents are Hong Kong exporters
that are involved in joint ventures in the PRC that manufacture lighters. Since PolyCity and Cli-Claque are located
outside the PRC, the PRC government does not have jurisdiction over them. Moreover, the PRC government does not have
any ownership interest in these exporters and, therefore, it cannot exercise control through ownership of these
companies. Further, we have no evidence on the record indicating that the PRC government exerts control over these
exporters. (See, business proprietary memorandum to the file dated December 5, 1994.) On this basis, we preliminarily
determine that there is no need to apply our separate rates analysis and that PolyCity and Cli-Claque are entitled
to individual rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In contrast to PolyCity and Cli-Claque, Gao Yao is a 50/50 joint venture between a Chinese company and Hong Kong company.
The joint venture owns both the production and export facilities used to manufacture and export the lighters it sells
to the United States. Given the direct PRC ownership in Gao Yao's export facilities, we have preliminarily determined
that it is appropriate to apply our separate rates analysis to this company. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COTCO's and GLIP's business licenses indicate that they are owned ``by all the people.'' As stated in the Final Determination
of Sales at Less than Fair Value: Silicon Carbide from the PRC (59 FR 22585, May 2, 1994) (``Silicon Carbide''), ``ownership
of a company by all the people does not require the application of a single rate.'' Accordingly, these companies are
eligible for consideration for a separate rate under our criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To establish whether a firm is entitled to a separate rate, the Department analyzes each exporting entity under a test
arising out of the Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sparklers from the PRC (56 FR 20588, May 6, 1991)
(``Sparklers'') and amplified in Silicon Carbide. Under the separate rates criteria, the Department assigns separate
rates only where respondents can demonstrate the absence of both 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 governmental control over export activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Absence of De Jure Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The respondents submitted a number of documents to demonstrate absence of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
control, including two PRC laws indicating that the responsibility for managing enterprises owned by ``all the people''
is with the enterprises themselves and not with the government. These are the ``Law of the People's Republic of China
on Industrial Enterprises Owned by the Whole People,'' adopted on April 13, 1988 (``1988 Law''); and the ``Regulations
for Transformation of Operational Mechanism of State-Owned Industrial Enterprises,'' approved on August 23, 1992
(``1992 Regulations''). Respondents' submission also included the ``Temporary Provisions for Administration
of Export Commodities,'' approved on December 21, 1992 (``Export Provisions''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1988 Law and 1992 Regulations shifted control from the government to the enterprises themselves. The 1988 Law
provides that enterprises owned by ``all the people'' shall make their own management decisions, be responsible
for their own profits and losses, choose their own suppliers and purchase their own goods and materials. The 1988 Law
contains other provisions which indicate that enterprises have management independence from the government. The
1992 Regulations provide that these same enterprises can, for example, set their own prices (Article IX); make their
own production decisions (Article XI); use their own retained foreign exchange (Article XII); allocate profits
(Article II); sell their own products without government interference (Article X); make their own investment decisions
(Article XIII); dispose of their own assets (Article XV); and hire and fire employees without government approval
(Article XVII). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Export Provisions indicate those products subject to direct government control. Lighters do not appear on the
Export Provisions list and are not, therefore, subject to export constraints. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with Silicon Carbide, we determine that the existence of these laws demonstrates that COTCO, GLIP, and
Gao Yao are not subject to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de jure
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 central government control with respect to export sales and pricing decisions. However, there is some evidence that
the provisions of the above-cited laws and regulations have not been implemented uniformly among different sectors
and/or jurisdictions in the PRC (see ``PRC Government Findings on Enterprise Autonomy,'' in Foreign Broadcast Information
Service-China-93&hyph;133 (July 14, 1993)). Therefore, the Department has determined that a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 analysis is critical to determine whether COTCO, Gao Yao and GLIP are subject to governmental control over export
sales and pricing decisions.

2. Absence of De Facto Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department typically considers four factors in evaluating whether a respondent is subject to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 government control of its export functions: (1) Whether the export prices are set by, or subject to the approval of,
a governmental authority; (2) whether the respondent has authority to negotiate and sign contracts and other agreements;
(3) whether the respondent has autonomy from the government in making decisions regarding the selection of management;
and (4) whether the respondent retains the proceeds of its export sales and makes independent decisions regarding
disposition of profits or financing of losses (see Silicon Carbide). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to our questionnaire, COTCO, GLIP, and Gao Yao have each asserted that they: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are able to borrow at market rates from commercial banks; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Maintain their own bank accounts, including foreign exchange earnings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Make independent business decisions, including what to export; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Set their own prices independently and that the prices are not subject to review by trading companies or government
authorities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Base their relationships with suppliers and customers on arm's length negotiations without governmental
interference; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Are not subject to foreign exchange targets set by either the central or provincial governments;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have the ability to sell, transfer, or acquire assets; Exporter-Specific Information: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following is a summary of additional information provided by the exporters: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gao Yao has stated that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It is a Sino-Hong Kong 50&hyph;50 joint venture; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It has no legal relationship with either the local, regional and/or national government; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It maintains a bank account in Hong Kong where all monies received from Gao Yao's foreign sales are deposited
and that the allocation of foreign currency is not subject to governmental review or approval; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Chinese joint venture and other laws confirm Gao Yao's independence (Gao Yao submitted an exhibit consisting
of laws pertaining to Sino-Foreign joint ventures in its response); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Management is selected by the board of directors, without any governmental interference; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Profits are divided evenly between the joint venture partners according to the shares invested; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The managing director of Gao Yao is a Hong Kong resident; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;All contracts are negotiated and signed by the officials of Gao Yao's Hong Kong sales office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GLIP has stated that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Management is selected by its board of directors; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Current ownership of the company is by ``all the people.'' The company received authorization to privatize
on March 5, 1993, and ``is in the process of totally privatizing;'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It is independently managed and operated (a statement to this effect from CCCME was included in the response
as an exhibit). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
COTCO has stated that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It is a limited liability company, owned by COTCO Beijing, which, in turn, is an ``all the people'' company;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;It is independently managed and operated (a statement to this effect from CCCME was included in the response
as an exhibit); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Its manager is hired following a public notice of vacancy, screening, and hiring negotiations; the manager
then selects the company's management committee; the decisions regarding the selection and promotion of management
are not subject to any entity's review or approval. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The information submitted on behalf of each of the three companies supports a preliminary finding that there is a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
absence of governmental control of export functions of each of the three companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, COTCO, Gao Yao and GLIP have preliminarily met the criteria for the application of separate rates.
We will examine this issue in detail at verification and determine whether the questionnaire responses are supported
by verifiable documentation.

Section 773(c)(4) of the Act requires the Department to value the NME producers' factors of production, to the extent
possible, in one or more market economies that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the NME
country and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. The Department has determined that Indonesia
is the most suitable surrogate for purposes of this investigation. Based on available statistical information,
Indonesia is at a level of economic development comparable to that of the PRC, and Indonesian export statistics indicate
that the country is a significant producer of lighters. Based on available information, Indonesia is the only surrogate
country, of those identified by our Office of Policy, that meet both of these criteria. (See, memorandum to the file
from Todd Hansen to Carole Showers, dated December 5, 1994, Surrogate Country Selection and memorandum from David
Mueller, Director, Office of Policy to Susan Kuhbach, Director, Office of Countervailing Investigations, dated
September 8, 1994, Lighters from the People's Republic of China, Non-Market Economy Status and Surrogate Country

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To determine whether sales of lighters from the PRC by COTCO, Gao Yao, GLIP, PolyCity and Cli-Claque were made at less
than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to FMV, as specified in the ``United States Price''
and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of the notice.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For all respondents, we based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because lighters
were sold directly to unrelated parties in the United States prior to importation into the United States, and because
exporter's sales price (``ESP'') methodology was not indicated by other circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We calculated purchase price based on packed, FOB foreign-port prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States,
and packed, CIF prices, where appropriate. We made deductions for foreign inland freight, containerization, loading,
port handling expenses, and marine insurance, as indicated. Generally, costs for these items were valued in the surrogate
country. However, where inland freight was purchased from market economy suppliers and paid for in a market economy
currency, we used the cost actually incurred by the exporter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Foreign Market Value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, we calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories
in the PRC which produced the subject merchandise for the five responding exporters. The factors used to produce lighters
include materials, labor and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported factor quantities were multiplied by the appropriate
surrogate values from Indonesia for those inputs purchased domestically from PRC suppliers. Where inputs were imported
from market economy countries and paid for in a market economy currency, we used the actual costs incurred by the producers
to value those factors (see, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China,
56 FR 55271, October 25, 1991). Where a respondent failed to provide certain factor information in a usable form, we
have used publicly available information from the petition and other respondents as best information available
in valuing these factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cli-Claque has argued that since it purchases certain input parts produced in the PRC from a Hong Kong reseller, the
Department should accept these prices as market-determined and use them when calculating FMV. We disagree with this
argument and have not used the prices for these inputs in calculating FMV. For purposes of valuing factors of production,
it is the Department's practice not to use prices from one PRC producer to an unrelated PRC producer because those prices
are distorted. In the present case, the two Hong Kong companies negotiated prices for inputs produced in the PRC on
behalf of their related production facilities located in the PRC. Therefore, we have determined that these input
prices should not be used to value the factors of production in this case. We have only used prices for imported inputs
which were produced in market-based economies to value those factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining which surrogate value to use for each factor of production which was not sourced from a market-economy
country, we selected, where possible, from publicly available, published information (``PAPI'') which was: (1)
an average non-export value; (2) representative of a range of prices within the POI if submitted by an interested party,
or most contemporaneous with the POI; (3) product-specific; and (4) tax-exclusive. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With the exception of butane, we used the Indonesian import price taken from the Indonesian Foreign Trade Statistical
Bulletin_Imports, November 1993. For butane, however, the amount imported into Indonesia was negligible compared
to the amount exported from that country. Therefore, for those PRC producers that did not import butane from market
economy sources, we relied on Indonesian export statistics, as reported in the Indonesian Foreign Trade Statistical
Bulletin_Exports, November 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We used Indonesian transportation rates taken from a September 18, 1991, U.S. State Department cable from the U.S.
Embassy in Indonesia to value inland freight between the source of the production factor and the disposable lighter
factories. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value electricity, we used public information from the Electric Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region
(January 1993) published by the Asian Development Bank. To value labor amounts, we used labor rates published by the

We adjusted the factor values, when necessary, to the POI using wholesale price indices (``WPIs'') published by the
International Monetary Fund (``IMF''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To value factory overhead, we calculated percentages based on a December 2, 1994 U.S. State Department cable from
the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta giving elements of industry group income statements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For general expense percentages, we used the statutory minimum of 10 percent of materials, labor, and overhead costs
calculated for each factory. For profit we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of materials, labor, factory
overhead, and general expenses. We did not have Indonesian values for either general expenses or profit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We added packing based on Indonesian values obtained from the Indonesian Foreign Trade Statistical Bulletin_Imports,
November 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cli-Claque argues that since it makes all of its sales/exports from Hong Kong, has all of its management, administrative
and selling operations in Hong Kong, and is wholly-owned and operated as a market-economy producer, we should treat
Cli-Claque as a market-economy producer and base FMV on Hong Kong home market prices. Failing this, Cli-Claque maintains
that since the PRC production facility does not know Cli-Claque's customers or the ultimate destination of the merchandise
and since the products enter the commerce of Hong Kong, we should, at a minimum, consider Cli-Claque as a third country
reseller and consider Hong Kong a viable home market on which to base FMV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree with Cli-Claque on both accounts. First, its related production facility is located in a non-market economy
country and, therefore, the FMV of the subject merchandise must be determined using the factors of production methodology.
Second, given the relationship between Cli-Claque and the PRC production facility, we do not consider that there
is a ``purchase'' from the PRC production facility by Cli-Claque within the meaning of section 773(f) of the Act. Therefore,
Cli-Claque is not considered a ``reseller'' within the meaning of that provision.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Potential exporters identified by MOFTEC failed to respond to our questionnaire. In the absence of responses from
these and other PRC exporters during the POI, we are basing the PRC country-wide rate on best information available
(BIA). When a company refuses to provide information requested in the form required, or otherwise significantly
impedes the Department's investigation, it is appropriate for the Department to assign to the company the higher
of (a) the highest margin alleged in the petition, or (b) the highest calculated rate of any respondent in the investigation
(see Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain
Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from Belgium, 58 FR 37083,
July 9, 1993) (``Belgium Steel''). Since some PRC exporters failed to respond to our questionnaire, we are assigning
to all other PRC exporters the highest margin in the May 27, 1994, amendment to the petition.

On November 23, 1994, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' exist with respect to imports of disposable
pocket lighters from the PRC. We did not receive the allegation in time to make a critical circumstance determination
in this preliminary determination. However, we will make a preliminary determination with respect to critical circumstances
no later than December 23, 1994, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.16(b)(2)(ii).

Suspension of Liquidation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For Gao Yao, we calculated a zero margin. Consistent with Notice of Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value:
Certain Cased Pencils from the People's Republic of China (59 FR 55625, November 8, 1994), merchandise that is sold
by Gao Yao but manufactured by other producers will not receive the zero margin. Instead, such entries will be subject
to the ``All Others'' margin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all
entries of disposable pocket lighters from the PRC, as defined in the ``Scope of the Investigation'' section of this
notice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this
notice in the

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Title III of the Export Trading Company Act of 1982 (``the Act'') [15 U.S.C. 4011&hyph;21] authorized the Secretary
of Commerce to issue export trade certificates of review. The regulations implementing Title III [''the Regulations'']
are found at 15 CFR part 325. Pursuant to this authority, a certificate of review was issued on September 8, 1992 to International
EXIM Corporation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A certificate holder is required by law (Section 308 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 4018) to submit to the Department of Commerce
annual reports that update financial and other information relating to business activities covered by its certificate.
The annual report is due within 45 days after the anniversary date of the issuance of the certificate of review [Sections
325.14(a) and (b) of the Regulations]. Failure to submit a complete annual report may be the basis for revocation [Sections
325.10(a) and 325.14(c) of the Regulations]. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Commerce sent to International EXIM Corporation on August 29, 1994, a letter containing annual
report questions with a reminder that its annual report was due on October 23, 1994. Additional reminders were sent
on October 24, 1994, and on November 16, 1994. The Department has received no written response to any of these letters.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 7, 1994, and in accordance with &sect;325.10(c)[2] of the Regulations, a letter was sent by certified
mail to notify International EXIM Corporation that the Department was formally initiating the process to revoke
its certificate. The letter stated that this action is being taken for the certificate holder's failure to file an
annual report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with &sect;325.10(c)(2) of the Regulations, each certificate holder has thirty days from the day after
its receipt of the notification letter in which to respond. The certificate holder is deemed to have received this
letter as of the date on which this notice is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. For good cause shown, the Department of Commerce can, at its discretion, grant a thirty-day extension for a response.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the certificate holder decides to respond, it must specifically address the Department's statement in the notification
letter that it has failed to file an annual report. It should state in detail why the facts, conduct, or circumstances
described in the notification letter are not true, or if they are, why they do not warrant revoking the certificate.
If the certificate holder does not respond within the specified period, it will be considered an admission of the statements
contained in the notification letter (Section 325.10(c)[2] of the Regulations). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the answer demonstrates that material facts are in dispute, the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice
shall, upon request, meet informally with the certificate holder. Either Department may require the certificate
holder to provide the documents or information that are necessary to support its contentions (Section 325.10(c)[3]
of the Regulations). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department shall publish a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the revocation or modification or a decision not to revoke or modify (Section 325.10(c)[4] of the Regulations).
If there is a determination to revoke a certificate, any person aggrieved by such final decision may appeal to an appropriate
U.S. district court within 30 days from the date on which the Department's final determination is published in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 156 of Title 35, United States Code, generally provides that the term of a patent may be extended for a period
of up to 5 years if the patent claims a product, or a method of making or using a product, that has been subject to certain
defined regulatory review. Under section 156, a patent is eligible for term extension only if regulatory review of
the claimed product was completed before the original patent term expired.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 3, 1993, section 156 was amended by Pub. L. No. 103&hyph;179 to provide that if the owner of record of the
patent or its agent reasonably expects the applicable regulatory review period to extend beyond the expiration of
the patent, the owner or its agent may submit an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks for an interim
extension of the patent term. If the Commissioner determines that, except for permission to market or use the product
commercially, the patent would be eligible for a statutory extension of the patent term, the Commissioner shall issue
to the applicant a certificate of interim extension for a period of not more than one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On November 25, 1994, the patent owner Akzona Incorporated filed an application under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) for interim
extension of the term of U.S. Patent No. 4,062,848. The application states that the patent claims the active ingredient
mirtapazine in the human drug product Remeron. The application indicates that the product is currently undergoing
a regulatory review before the Food and Drug Administration for permission to market or use the product commercially.
The original term of the patent is set to expire on December 13, 1994. Applicant requests an interim extension of the
term of the patent for a period of one year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Review of the application indicates that, except for permission to market or use the product commercially, the subject
patent would be eligible for an extension of the patent term under 35 U.S.C. 156. Since it is apparent that the regulatory
review period may extend beyond the expiration of the original patent term, an interim extension of the patent term
under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) is appropriate. Accordingly, an interim extension under 35 U.S.C. 156(d)(5) of the term
of U.S. Patent No. 4,062,848 has been granted for a period of one year from the original expiration date of the patent.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection (e)(12) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), requires agencies to publish advance notice
of any proposed or revised computer matching program by the matching agency for public comment. The DoD, as the matching
agency under the Privacy Act, is hereby giving constructive notice in lieu of direct notice to the record subjects
of a computer matching program between OPM and DoD that their records are being matched by computer. The objective
is to identify individuals who are improperly receiving military retired pay and (1) credit for military service
in their civil service annuities, or (2) annuities based on the `guaranteed minimum' disability formula. This match
will identify and/or prevent erroneous payments under the Civil Service Retirement Act (CSRA), the Federal Employees'
Retirement System Act (FERSA), and the Joint Uniform Military Retired Pay System. This agreement replaces all existing
data exchange agreements that pertain to the disclosure of beneficiary payment data between DMDC and OPM.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to subsection (o) of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, (5 U.S.C. 552a), the OPM and DoD has concluded an agreement
to conduct a computer matching program between the agencies. The purpose of the match is to exchange personal data
between the agencies for identification of individuals who are improperly receiving military retired pay. The match
will yield the identity and location of those individuals within the Federal government so that OPM can make more timely
and accurate adjustments in benefits, and prevent or correct overpayments, fraud and abuse, thus assuring proper
benefit payments. Computer matching appeared to be the most efficient and effective manner to accomplish this task
with the least amount of intrusion of personal privacy of the individuals concerned. It was therefore concluded and
agreed upon that computer matching would be the best and least obtrusive manner and choice for accomplishing this
requirement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A copy of the computer matching agreement between OPM and DoD is available upon request to the public. Requests should
be submitted to the address caption above or to the Quality Assurance Division, Retirement and Insurance Group, 1900
E Street, NW, Washington, DC 20415.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The matching agreement, as required by 5 U.S.C. 552a(r) of the Privacy Act, and an advance copy of this notice was submitted
on December 1, 1994, to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives, the Committee on Governmental
Affairs of the Senate, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management
and Budget pursuant to paragraph 4d of Appendix I to OMB Circular No. A&hyph;130, ``Federal Agency Responsibilities
for Maintaining Records about Individuals,'' dated July 15, 1994 (59 FR 37906, July 25, 1994). The matching program
is subject to review by OMB and Congress and shall not become effective until that review period has elapsed.

The systems of records maintained by the respective agencies under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a,
from which records will be disclosed for the purpose of this computer match are as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. OPM will use the record system identified as OPM/CENTRAL&hyph;1, Civil Service Retirement and Insurance Records,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
last published at 58 FR 19170, April 12, 1993, and revised at 58 FR 41300, August 3, 1993.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. DoD will use the record system identified as S322.10 DMDC, Defense Manpower Data Center Data Base, 59 FR 55462, November
7, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The categories of records in the OPM and DoD records are personnel employment records. The categories of individuals
in the OPM system consists of active, separated and retired civilian employees. The DMDC database, established under
an interagency agreement between DoD, OPM, OMB, and the Department of the Treasury, consists of employment records
of Federal employees and military members, active, and retired. Both record systems involved contain an appropriate
routine use disclosure provision required by the Privacy Act permitting the interchange of the affected personal
information between OPM and DoD. These routine uses are compatible with the purpose for collecting the information
and establishing and maintaining the record systems.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) requires that the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) provide interested Federal agencies and the public an early opportunity to comment on information collection
requests. OMB may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation
in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal law, or substantially
interfere with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations. The Director of the Information Resources
Group, publishes this notice containing proposed information collection requests prior to submission of these
requests to OMB. Each proposed information collection, grouped by office, contains the following: (1) Type of review
requested, e.g., new, revision, extension, existing or reinstatement; (2) Title; (3) Frequency of collection;
(4) The affected public; (5) Reporting burden; and/or (6) Recordkeeping burden; and (7) Abstract. OMB invites public
comment at the address specified above. Copies of the requests are available from Patrick J. Sherrill at the address
specified above.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2) it is making a financial assistance award
under grant Number DE-FG01&hyph;95EE15617 to Custom Electronics, Incorporated. The proposed grant will provide
funding in the amount of $99,945 by the Department of Energy for the purpose of saving energy through development of
a gas broiler control to automatically limit gas flow to cooking equipment when it is not in use.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department of Energy has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) that the unsolicited application
for financial assistance submitted by Custom Electronics, Incorporated is meritorious based on the general evaluation
required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and the proposed project represents a unique idea that would not be eligible for financial
assistance under a recent, current or planned solicitation. The co-inventor, William Garceau, who will be assisted
by Thomas Speakman, has many years of experience performing advanced research work in the fields of electronics and
material sciences. The proposed project is not eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current or planned
solicitation because the funding program, the Energy Related Invention program (ERIP), has been structured since
its beginning in 1975 to operate without competitive solicitations because the authorizing legislation directs
ERIP to provide support for worthy ideas submitted by the public. The program has never issued and has no plans to issue
a competitive solicitation.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of the Willow Creek Wildlife Mitigation Project, BPA proposes to revegetate an emergent wetland with native
wet meadow grasses and herbs. The proposal is to plow a wetland site in order to disrupt the seed bank of non-native grasses
and re-plant the area with native wet meadow grasses and herbs. The project is expected to expand native habitat in
the Willow Creek Natural Area by providing native wetlands, improve storm water runoff quality, and providing additional
flood protection. The proposed project would occur in sections 4 and 9 of T18S&hyph;R4W. The wetlands occur on land
that would be acquired by BPA and are adjacent to the Willow Creek Natural Area.

On August 2, 1994, in Docket No. GP94&hyph;16&hyph;000, the Commission preliminarily found that five well determinations
by the Office of Conservation for the State of Louisiana (Louisiana) are not supported by substantial evidence.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Louisiana's determinations find that gas produced from the five wells qualifies as natural gas produced from geopressured
brine under section 107(c)(2) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA).

On September 6, 1994, WRT Energy Corporation (WRT), the applicant before Louisiana, filed a letter withdrawing its
applications for the five wells. By letter dated September 9, 1994, the Commission advised WRT that the withdrawal
nullified the applications and Louisiana's determinations and terminated the proceeding in Docket No. GP94&hyph;16&hyph;000.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 19, 1994, WRT asked the Commission to allow it to withdraw its letter filed on September 6, 1994, and, if
necessary, to reinstate the proceeding in Docket No. GP94&hyph;16&hyph;000. WRT states that it withdrew its applications
because it believed that it would not have sufficient time to effectively respond to the preliminary finding but that
after it withdrew its applications, it became aware that staff would allow WRT additional time to file comments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, WRT and Louisiana filed comments urging the Commission to reverse the preliminary finding on October
5, 1994. In addition, an informal conference was held on October 26, 1994, and WRT, Louisiana and the Interstate Oil
and Gas Compact Commission (IOCC) filed comments urging the Commission to find that gas from the five wells qualify
as geopressured brine gas on November 4, 1994, November 8, 1994, and November 4, 1994, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to &sect;275.202(d) of the regulations, the letter WRT filed on September 6, 1994 nullified both the determinations
and the underlying applications on that date.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 However, since WRT states that it withdrew the applications due to a misunderstanding and has filed additional comments
to support the applications, for good cause shown, we grant WRT's request to withdraw the letter filed on September
6, 1994, so as to reinstate its applications and Louisiana's determinations as of the date of this order. However,
inasmuch as the proceeding in Docket No. GP94&hyph;16&hyph;00 has been terminated, the Commission will process
the determinations, and underlying applications, in a new proceeding and hereby makes a preliminary finding in Docket
No. GP94&hyph;18&hyph;000, pursuant to the procedures previously set forth in section 275.202(a) of the regulations,
that Louisiana's determinations for the five wells are not supported by substantial evidence in the records upon
which they were made for the reasons stated in our August 2, 1994 Notice of Preliminary Finding. In addition, the record
in Docket No. GP94&hyph;16&hyph;000 is included in new Docket No. GP94&hyph;18&hyph;000.

Order No. 567, issued on July 28, 1994, rescinded the Commission's NGPA's regulations, including Section 275 as of
that date (68 FERC &para; 61,135). The Commission stated, however, that rescission of Part 275 is prospective only
and that timely filed applications for well determination proceedings still pending before the Commission will
continue to be subject to the requirements of Part 275 as that section existed before July 28, 1994.

The Commission will issue a final order in Docket No. GP94&hyph;18&hyph;000 no later than 120 days from the date hereof.
Since the final order will consider the comments filed on the August 2, 1994 preliminary finding and the comments filed
after the informal conference, WRT, Louisiana and the IOCC need not file additional comments.

Take notice that on December 5, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), tendered for filing, pursuant to Part 154
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) Regulations Under the Natural Gas Act and in compliance
with the Commission's Order on Remand issued November 4, 1994 (November 4, 1994 order), at Docket No. RP88&hyph;44&hyph;045,
certain tariff sheets to its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1&hyph;A.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso states that it is adding a new section 4.2(e) to its Capacity Allocation Procedure in compliance with the November
4, 1994, order in which the Commission ordered El Paso to revise its tariff to include provisions giving relief to any
Shipper serving high priority end-users when that Shipper has exhausted all other self-help remedies in times of
bona fide emergencies. Accordingly, section 4.2(e) provides for the allocation of capacity required to meet an emergency
for firm Shippers serving high priority end-users in cases of a bona fide emergency that would result in irreparable
injury to life or property, absent the availability of additional pipeline capacity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso respectfully requests that the Commission accept the tendered tariff sheets for filing and permit them to
become effective January 4, 1995, which is not less than thirty (30) days following the date of the filing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
El Paso states that copies of the filing were served upon all of El Paso's interstate pipeline system transportation
customers and interested state regulatory commissions.

in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestant parties to the proceeding.
Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference
Room.

to provide for operational flow orders (OFOs) on Northwest's system, to enumerate the circumstances under which
OFOs will be invoked, to impose penalties on parties who fail to abide by such OFOs, to limit a party's liability for
actions taken in accordance with an OFO and to limit Northwest's liability for issuing OFOs, provided Northwest acts
reasonably and in good faith. The Commission accepted and suspended these tariff sheets, subject to refund and conditions,
to be effective November 6, 1994. The Commission directed Northwest to make six revisions of its tariff and specified
certain other issues which will be discussed further at a technical conference with results being reported to the
Commission within 120 days of the issuance of the November 4, 1994 Order.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Health and Environmental Research (OHER) of the Office of Energy Research (ER), U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE), announces its interest in receiving applications for support of the research and development of technology
for commercial exploitation of electron beam sterilization of infectious hospital waste in preparation for disposal.
It is essential that the research be conducted at a public, urban teaching hospital affiliated with a comprehensive
medical school and research center with an active electron beam program and documentable experience in operating
a functional machine. In recent years, the practice of handling medical infectious waste by incineration or autoclaving
has resulted in public controversies in terms of environmental and public health issues. Irradiation of medical
infectious waste by electrons might provide an environmentally safe and publically acceptable method for disposing
of this waste. Applications should also address: (a) Monitoring and validating the treatment efficacy; (b) pre-irradiation
processing of waste, and (c) economic feasibility of this approach. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before preparing a formal application, potential applicants are encouraged to submit a brief preapplication, in
accordance with 10 CFR 600.10(d)(2), which consists of two to three pages of narrative describing research objectives
and methods of accomplishment. The preapplications will be reviewed relative to the scope and research needs for
the commercial exploitation of electron irradiation technology for medical waste disposal. Preapplications referencing
program Notice 95&hyph;08 should be received by January 1, 1995, and sent to Dr. Matesh N. Varma, Office of Health and
Environmental Research, ER&hyph;73, U.S. Department of Energy, GTN, Washington, D.C. 20585, telephone: (301)903&hyph;3209.
Telephone and telefax numbers are required to be a part of the preapplication. A response to the preapplications discussing
potential relevance of a formal application will be communicated by January 15, 1995.

 The Office of Basic Energy Sciences of the Office of Energy Research (ER), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announces
its interest in receiving preapplications from potential applicants for research funding in the Energy Biosciences
program area. The intent in asking for a preapplication is to save the time and effort of applicants in preparing and
submitting a formal project application that may be inappropriate for the program. The preliminary screening of
research ideas is aimed also at relieving some of the burden of the scientific community in peer reviewing an excessive
number of research applications. The preapplication should consist of a two to three page concept paper about the
research being contemplated as a potential, formal application to the Energy Biosciences program. The concept paper
should focus on the objectives of the planned research, its scientific goals and their significance, an outline of
the approaches planned, and any other information that relates to the planned research. No budget information or
biographical data need be included; nor is an institutional endorsement necessary. The preapplication gives DOE
the opportunity to evaluate the technical suitability of submitting a formal application for support of research
ideas. A response indicating the appropriateness of submitting a formal application will be sent from the Division
of Energy Biosciences office in time to allow for an adequate preparation period for a formal application.

Funds are expected to be available for new grant awards in FY 1996. The magnitude of these funds available and the number
of awards which can be made will depend on the budget process. The new awards made during FY 1994 averaged about $87,000
per year. Most awards are funded for a three-year period. The principal purpose in using preapplications at this time
is to reduce the expenditure of time and effort of all parties. Information about development and submission of applications,
eligibility, limitations, evaluations and selection processes, and other policies and procedures may be found
in the Application Guide for the Office of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program and 10 CFR Part 605. The Application

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sec. 409(b)(5) (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(5))), notice is given that a food
additive petition (FAP 4A4412) has been filed by Roquette America, Inc., c/o Keller and Heckman, 1001 G St. NW., Washington,
DC 20001. The petition proposes that the food additive regulations in &sect;180.25 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Mannitol
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (21 CFR 180.25) be amended to permit the manufacture of mannitol by fermentation of sugars or sugar alcohols such as
glucose, sucrose, fructose, or sorbitol by the action of the yeast 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Zygosaccharomyces rouxii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of FDA's comprehensive safety review of substances on the list of substances generally recognized as safe
(GRAS), the safety of mannitol as a food ingredient was evaluated in 1972 by the Select Committee on GRAS Substances
(SCOGS) from the Life Sciences Research Office of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology
(FASEB). SCOGS concluded that mannitol was safe when used in food at current or reasonably expected future levels.
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of July 26, 1973 (38 FR 20046), FDA proposed to affirm the GRAS status of mannitol that was manufactured by the process
then known to the agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to the proposal, the agency received a comment stating that mannitol was also commonly manufactured by
a process different from that set out in the proposed GRAS affirmation. The agency also received information raising
questions about the safety of mannitol. Data from studies on mannitol demonstrated a significant (but not dose related)
incidence of benign thymomas, and an abnormal growth of thymus gland tissue, in female rats fed mannitol. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a result of these findings, the agency concluded that additional data were necessary to evaluate the safety of mannitol.
Thus, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 23, 1974 (39 FR 34178), the agency declined to affirm the use of mannitol as GRAS and, instead, established
an interim food additive regulation for use of mannitol at existing levels. The interim regulation, &sect;121.4005
(21 CFR 121.4005) (redesignated as &sect;180.25 (21 CFR 180.25)) required that mannitol be manufactured by either
the process FDA had proposed to affirm as GRAS or the process described in the comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the publication of the interim food additive regulation, the agency received data that showed an increased
combined incidence of medullary hyperplasia and pheochromocytoma of the adrenal glands in Fischer rats fed a diet
of 10 percent mannitol. No such mannitol-treatment effect, however, was observed in Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1985, FASEB, under contract with FDA, established an ad hoc Expert Panel on Sugar Alcohols and Lactose to study certain
effects that had been observed in animal experiments in which the test animals were fed sugar alcohols and lactose.
In a report submitted to FDA in 1986, ``Health Aspects of Sugar Alcohols and Lactose,'' FASEB concluded that there
was a statistically significant increased incidence of adrenal medullary hyperplasia and pheochromocytoma in
rats fed high levels of sugar alcohols, including mannitol. The report further concluded that the existing data provided
no satisfactory mechanistic explanations of these adrenal medullary lesions, which are commonly found in aged rats
maintained on standard laboratory diets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FDA is continuing to evaluate the FASEB report on sugar alcohols, including mannitol, as well as other data from animal
studies of these substances to determine whether any regulatory action is appropriate for any or all of the sugar alcohols.
During this period of continuing evaluation, mannitol continues to be listed, on an interim basis, for food use.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Roquette America's petition to amend the interim food additive regulation on mannitol, if granted, would not change
the allowed uses of mannitol; it would simply permit a new method of manufacture of the additive. The subject regulation
on mannitol specifies manufacturing procedures that do not include the fermentation process used in Roquette's
production of mannitol. To permit a new manufacturing method, Roquette's petition proposes to amend the interim
food additive regulation (&sect;180.25) to provide for the use of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Zygosaccharomyces rouxii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in the fermentation process of producing mannitol from sugars and sugar alcohols.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent
with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing
the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of this notice on public display at the
Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. Interested persons may, on or before January
12, 1995, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments. Two copies of any comments are
to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number
found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and
4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA will also place on public display any amendments to, or comments on, the petitioner's
environmental assessment without further announcement in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. If, based on its review, the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition
results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence
supporting that finding will be published with the regulation in the

<DOCTITLE>Program Announcement and Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate''
for Implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference for Grants for Podiatric Primary Care Residency
Training Programs </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that applications will be accepted for fiscal
year (FY) 1995 Grants for Podiatric Primary Care Residency Training Programs under the authority of section 751,
title VII of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of
1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on the proposed minimum percentages for
``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' for the implementation of the general statutory funding preference.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately $600,000 will be available in FY 1995 for this program. It is anticipated that the $600,000 will support
approximately 7 competing awards averaging $86,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 751 authorizes the award of grants for the purpose of planning and implementing projects in primary care training
for podiatric physicians in approved or provisionally approved residency programs which shall provide financial
assistance in the form of traineeships to residents who participate in such projects and who plan to specialize in
primary care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Eligible entities for this program are schools of podiatric medicine and public and nonprofit private hospitals.
As noted above, the authorizing legislation limits eligibility to residency programs that are approved or provisionally
approved. The Council on Podiatric Medical Education (CPME), the recognized accrediting body for podiatric medicine,
uses the term ``candidate status'' in lieu of ``provisional approval.'' For the purposes of this program ``candidate
status'' will be accepted as meeting the statutory requirement for ``provisional approval.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants to this program that are planning to initiate a new podiatric primary care residency program are expected
to apply to CPME for candidate status. Grants will only be awarded to applicants that can demonstrate the attainment
of candidate status by July 1, 1995. The application for Federal funding must demonstrate, through responses to the
program specifications, that an adequate emphasis will be placed on podiatric primary care. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The period of Federal support should not exceed 3 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Review Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HRSA will review applications based on an analysis of the following factors: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The degree to which the proposed project provides for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the project requirements; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The administrative and management capability of the applicant to carry out the proposed project in a cost effective
manner; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The degree to which the proposed training program emphasizes training in podiatric primary care settings; and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The potential of the project to continue on a self sustaining basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Considerations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition, the following funding factors may be applied in determining funding of approved applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other
categories or groups of approved applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request
consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
General Statutory Funding Preference 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to qualified applicants that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) have a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of
medically underserved communities; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) have achieved, during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, a significant increase
in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of proposals recommended
for approval by the peer review group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 25 percent of the combined Podiatric Primary Care Residency graduates in academic
years 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice
in medically underserved communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94, the rate
of placing graduates in medically underserved communities has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than
15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in medically underserved communities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference has been published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM), Las Cruces District Office, will be directing the preparation of an EIS to be prepared by a third
party contractor. The EIS will describe the potential impacts of the proposed reestablishment of the Little Rock
open-pit copper mining project located approximately 10 miles southwest of Silver City in Grant County, New Mexico.
The proposed Little Rock Project would reestablish an open-pit copper mining operation at a site that was developed
and operated sporadically between the 1950
<!-- PJG 0256 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; and 1972. The proposed Little Rock Project would resume mining operations at the site and would have a projected
operating life of between 2 and 4 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In 1993, Phelps Dodge Mining Company submitted a Plan of Operations (POO) to reestablish mining activities at the
Little Rock mine. Since it was indicated by the BLM that the preparation of an EIS would likely be required, no Environmental
Assessment (EA) was done. Instead, Phelps Dodge agreed to proceed in preparing an EIS and completed a Memorandum of
Agreement (MOA) between themselves, the BLM, and the United States Forest Service (USFS) outlining the responsibilities
of each party to the agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Phelps Dodge and the current owner, MM Holdings of San Jose, California, have entered into a lease-purchase agreement
whereby Phelps Dodge has an option to purchase the Little Rock property pending a successful effort on its part to obtain
the necessary environmental and operating permits and approvals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Little Rock mine is a small oxide copper deposit located approximately 1 mile west of the existing Phelps Dodge
mining operation at Tyrone, New Mexico. It has operated sporadically, most recently between 1970 and 1972, producing
copper via leaching and subsequent copper cementation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As proposed in the POO, the project would be a conventional open-pit mining operation with a daily production rate
of as high as 160,000 tons for a period of between 2 and 4 years. No processing or waste disposal facilities are planned
for the project area. All material mined will be transported to the existing Tyrone mine facilities via a haul road
to be constructed from the Tyrone mine to the project site. Overburden or other inert, non-mineralized materials
will be transported to the existing Tyrone tailing dams for use as cover material for tailing dam closure or stockpiled
for reclamation of the site. All leachable material will be processed at existing permitted processing sites at the
Tyrone mine. All solid wastes generated at the Little Rock mine will be transported to and disposed of at existing permitted
facilities at the Tyrone mine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No permanent facilities will be constructed for the operations proposed under this Plan, with the possible exception
of dewatering facilities if required by the New Mexico State Engineer or the New Mexico Environment Department. Minimal
associated facilities specific to future mining of this site will be required and will consist of a temporary office
trailer, a dewatering system, a water pipeline and fill station to provide water for dust suppression, a 46kV power
distribution system, and a fuel dock. All these facilities will be transported or aligned along the proposed haul
road or existing routes and will be removed upon completion of mining. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All mine overburden (waste) will be hauled off-site to be stockpiled on private property on top of existing, permitted
Phelps Dodge tailing piles located northeast of the site. All suitable leach material mined from the site will be hauled
to existing, permitted leach facilities on Phelps Dodge property. Existing leach and waste stockpiles from prior
mining activities on the site would also be removed to these sites or remediated in-place, as required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Remaining waste products from the mining operations will be negligible since maintenance, office, and managerial
functions will be located at the Tyrone mine. The Little Rock mine and associated facilities will be provided with
trash dumpsters and will utilize the existing Tyrone solid waste landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reclamation of some items (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 removal of existing foundations, stockpiles and trash) would be done prior to, or concurrent with, mining activities.
All existing debris would be transferred to the Tyrone mine for recycling or disposal. All non-recyclable materials
will be disposed of at Tyrone's existing solid waste landfill. Reclamation of the majority of the site will follow
mining to allow final limits of disturbance to be determined. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EIS will address issues of geology and minerals, soils, water resources, vegetation, wildlife, range management,
air quality, visual resources, reclamation, land use, access, recreation, wilderness, cultural resources, social
and economic values, transportation and noise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The BLM has identified the following potentially significant impacts as requiring additional analysis: The quality
and quantity of post-mining water generated by the open pit; the effect on surface water quality and riparian areas
of the proposed haul road to the Little Rock site; and the effect on surface water quality and riparian areas of the proposed
diversion of California Gulch around the Little Rock site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because these issues were determined to require special investigation, it is anticipated that the majority of work
for other resources will be limited to summarizing and incorporating by reference data and analyses from existing
environmental studies as prescribed in 40 CFR 1500.4 and 1500.5. Additional investigation may be indicated for other
resources after review of existing data and comments received during the scoping process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
BLM's scoping process for the EIS will include: (1) Identification of issues to be addressed; (2) identification
of viable alternatives; and (3) notifying interested groups, individuals, and agencies so that additional information
concerning these issues can be obtained. The scoping will consist of a news release announcing the start of the EIS
process; letters of invitation to participate in the scoping process; and a scoping document which further clarifies
the proposed action and significant issues being considered to be distributed to those on the mailing list and available
upon request.

Under the provisions of Public Law 97&hyph;451, a petition for reinstatement of Oil and Gas Lease NMNM 68086, Roosevelt
County, New Mexico, was timely filed and was accompanied by all required rentals and royalties accruing from May 1,
1994, the date of termination. No valid lease has been issued affecting the land. The lessee has agreed to new lease
terms for rentals and royalties at rates of $5.00 per acre, or fraction thereof, and 162/3 percent, respectively.
Payment of a $500.00 administrative fee has been made. Having met all the requirements for reinstatement of the lease
as set in Section 31 (d) and (e) of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 188 (d) and (e)), the Bureau of
Land Management is proposing to reinstate the lease effectively May 1, 1994, subject to the original terms and conditions
of the lease and the increased rental and royalty rates cited above, and the reimbursement for cost of publication
of this Notice.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Fish and Wildlife Service has reviewed the operation of the SFR and WR Programs into the next century and has completed
a Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (SPEIS) to the Program Environmental Impact Statement
(EIS) published in 1978. The data, analyses, and conclusions of the 1978 EIS, where still valid, are incorporated
by reference.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the 1978 EIS, continued population growth has resulted in intensified resource use; values, interests, and
leisure-time activities have increased demand for non-consumptive uses; and natural resources management priorities,
Federal laws and funding patterns have altered the Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No change to the existing Program direction has been selected as the SPEIS preferred alternative. Overwhelming support
of the existing program was indicated by respondents to the draft document issued in November 1993. The majority of
comments urged that the Program remain unchanged and cited examples of successful cooperative projects that have
been undertaken. Most comments expressed belief that States are the best qualified to assess the needs of their citizens
for the management of fish and wildlife resources. The view was also expressed that the Federal government should
not become more involved in establishing priorities for State projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The WR Program will continue to provide positive benefits for game species, non-game wildlife species/biodiversity,
threatened endangered species, wetland/floodplain habitat, terrestrial habitat, recreation, local economies,
social values, and cultural resources. The SFR Program will continue to provide positive benefits for sport fish,
non-game fish species and diversity, threatened and endangered species, recreation, local economies, and social
values.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) needs to obtain Digital Line Graphs (DLG), Digital Elevation Models (DEM), Digital
Raster Graphics (DRG), and Digital Orthophotoquads (DOQ) captured from or registered to USGS primary series topographic
maps for entry into the National Digital Cartographic Data Base (NDCDB) as part of the public domain. The USGS recognizes
the public benefit of obtaining DLG, DEM, DLG, and DOQ data prepared by State and local government agencies, public
utilities, and private firms. The USGS seeks to identify other sources of digital map data for areas now lacking DLG,
DEM, DRG, or DOQ coverage, and to obtain technically acceptable data through cooperative agreements. When it is in
the Government's interest, and subject to the availability of appropriated funds, the USGS will assist qualified
organizations in preparing digital map data to USGS standards for NDCDB archiving and public distribution in non-proprietary
formats.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice does not solicit contract support for specific USGS digital mapping requirements, nor does it encourage
speculative ventures by any potential cooperator. The intent is to identify accurate primary digital map data being
prepared by non-Federal organizations to support their own mapping needs, and to determine whether the data can be
obtained in DLG, DEM, DRG, and DOQ formats (or converted to these formats by USGS) through cooperative agreements.
All data obtained under this initiative will be archived by USGS as part of the public domain.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Acceptable data must meet general requirements for source, content, accuracy, and format as detailed in USGS National
Mapping Program Technical Instructions:

funds; source materials; public domain software; data validation; technical assistance; other materials and services.
Assistance will be offered to the applicant(s) offering the greatest technical benefits at a fair and reasonable
cost relative to the amount of USGS funds available. All proposed cooperative agreements must be determined by the
USGS to serve the public interest, and to comply with applicable public law. Authority for this Program is contained
in the Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey Fiscal Year 1994 appropriation bill.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) conducts short-term technical training in occupational
safety and health through the OSHA Training Institute in Des Plaines, Illinois. In recent years, the number of private
sector personnel and Federal personnel from agencies other than OSHA requesting training has increased beyond the
capacity of the OSHA Training Institute to meet the demand. In October 1992, OSHA began a project to test the feasibility
of using other training or educational institutions to conduct OSHA Training Institute courses for private sector
personnel and for Federal personnel from agencies other than OSHA. Based on the success to date of this project, OSHA
is expanding the program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The OSHA Training Institute conducts 82 short-term technical training courses in OSHA standards, policies and procedures
for persons responsible for enforcing or directly supporting the OSH Act, private sector employers and employees,
and Federal personnel from agencies other than OSHA. Its primary responsibility is to the first group: Federal and
State compliance officers and State consultation program staff. Private sector and Federal personnel from agencies
other than OSHA receive training on an ``as available'' basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In recent years the demand for training has increased from all three groups. Resources of the OSHA Training Institute
have not increased at a rate that can keep up with the demand. As the number of Federal and State personnel engaged in
enforcement or consultation being trained has increased, opportunities for training for private sector personnel
and Federal personnel from agencies other than OSHA have remained static or decreased. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to meet the increased demand for its courses, the OSHA Training Institute has selected eight educational
institutions to conduct OSHA Training Institute courses for private sector personnel and Federal personnel from
agencies other than OSHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These OSHA Training Institute Education Centers, which were selected through nationwide competitive processes,
are: Keene State College, Manchester, New Hampshire; Niagara County Community College, Lockport, New York; West
Virginia University/National Resource Center for Construction Safety and Health, Morgantown, West Virginia;
Georgia Tech Research Institute, Atlanta, Georgia; Texas Engineering Extension Service/Texas Safety Association,
Arlington, Texas; Maple Woods Community College, Kansas City, Missouri; Red Rocks Community College/Trinidad
State Junior College, Lakewood, Colorado; and the University of California, San Diego, California. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OSHA Training Institute now proposes to expand the number of OSHA Training Institute Education Centers from eight
to ten. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
OSHA will enter into nonfinancial agreements with two colleges, universities or other nonprofit training organizations
to conduct OSHA courses for private sector personnel and Federal personnel from agencies other than OSHA. The two
new OSHA Training Institute Education Centers will be located in two OSHA Regions, one per region. The two OSHA Regions
contain the following states.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
1. Region V: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Region X: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new OSHA Training Institute Education Centers will be selected through a competitive process. This notice solicits
applications from organizations interested in participating in the project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants selected to participate as OSHA Training Institute Education Centers will be expected to present six
courses: four general industry OSHA courses: Course 204A, Machinery and Machine Guarding Standards; Course 501,
A Guide to Voluntary Compliance in Safety and Health; Course 521, OSHA Guide to Voluntary Compliance in the Industrial
Hygiene Area; and Course 600, Collateral Duty Course for Other Federal Agencies; and two constructions industry
course: Course 500, Instructor Course in Occupational Safety and Health Standards for the Construction Industry
and Course 510, Occupational Safety and Health Standards for the Construction Industry. Additional information
about each of these courses is in the appendix to this notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants will be selected based upon their occupational safety and health experience, their nonacademic training
background, the availability of classroom and lodging facilities, and access to transportation. OSHA will support
the program by providing curriculum outlines, masters of student handouts, and orientation to OSHA course presentation.
OSHA also will provide assistance in presenting and/or answering questions on OSHA policy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project will be fifteen months in duration. OSHA will monitor each of the new OSHA Training Institute Education
Centers to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. If performance is satisfactory at the end of the fifteen-month
period, OSHA will enter into a new agreement for a two-year period. Continuation of this agreement will be dependent
on continued satisfactory performance and mutual interest of the parties in continuing the OSHA Training Institute
Education Center program. OSHA may initiate modifications to agreements to increase or decrease the number of different
OSHA courses offered by the OSHA Training Institute Education Centers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Eligibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Any nonprofit public or private college or university is eligible to apply. Any other nonprofit organization that
can demonstrate that training or education is part of its mission and that more than 50 percent of its staff and dollar
resources is devoted to training or education is also eligible to apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to meeting the eligibility criteria, applicants must have a physical presence in the Region for which
they are applying. For example, an eligible national organization based in San Francisco that has a training facility
in Chicago would have a physical presence in Region V. On the other hand, a national organization based in New York City
that rents hotel space to provide training at multiple sites around the county would be considered to have a physical
presence only in New York and would not be qualified to apply.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A training or educational institution may elect to apply for this program in partnership with a safety and health organization
that is not primarily a training organization. For example, a university could enter into an agreement with a labor
union that provides for the use of university classrooms and faculty supplemented by union safety and health professionals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If two or more organizations wish to apply as a consortium, a training or educational member of the consortium must
be designated as the lead organization. OSHA will only enter into a nonfinancial agreement with the lead organization.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Financial Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Organizations selected as OSHA Training Institute Education Centers will not be provided funding by OSHA to support
this effort. The Centers will be expected to support their OSHA training through their normal tuition and fee structures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 -->
Length of Project
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The project will start July 1, 1995, and will run for fifteen months.

including lathes, mills, boring machines, screw machines, woodworking machines, mechanical power presses, and
power transmission apparatus. Students are given an opportunity to apply hazard recognition concepts on a site inspection
at an operating facility with a variety of machine operations. They evaluate and document any machinery and machine
guarding hazards, then return to the classroom to research the standards for citation references. They present an
oral report on their findings.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NARA will hold a public meeting with vendors to discuss a proposal to change procedures for ordering reproductions
of archival still photographs, aerial film, maps, and drawings from the Still Picture Branch, Cartographic and Architectural
Branch, and other units of the National Archives. The proposal would privatize the reporudction of these archival
materials by allowing customers to place their order directly with vendors. In addition, NARA would assign work space
to the vendors in its new building in College Park, MD, in order that the materials can be copied on its premises. The
proposed procedures, which will be tested for a one-year trial period, are intended to expedite the reproduction
ordering process and to ascertain the extent to which digital scanning can satisfy customer requirements.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
NARA will hold a public meeting with researchers to discuss a proposal to change procedures for ordering reproductions
of archival still photographs, aerial film, maps, and drawings from the Still Picture Branch, Cartographic and Architectural
Branch, and other units of the National Archives. The proposal would privatize the reproduction of these archival
materials by allowing customers to place their orders directly with vendors. In addition, NARA would assign work
space to vendors in its new building in College Park, MD, in order that the materials can be copied on its premises. The
proposed procedures, which will be tested for a one-year trial period, are intended to expedite the reproduction
ordering process and to ascertain the extent to which digital scanning can satisfy customer requirements.

<DOCTITLE>Illinois Power Company, et al.; Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (Commission) has issued Amendment No. 95 to Facility Operating License No.
NPF&hyph;62 issued to Illinois Power Company (the licensee), which revised the Technical Specifications for operation
of the Clinton Power Station, Unit 1, located in Dewitt County, Illinois. The amendment is effective as of the date
of issuance.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The amendment modified the Technical Specifications by replacing the existing Technical Specifications in their
entirety with a new set of Technical Specifications based on NUREG&hyph;1434, ``Improved BWR&hyph;6 Technical
Specifications,'' dated September 1992. This amendment was based on the licensee's submittal of October 26, 1993,
and supplemented by letters dated April 26, October 31, November 18, and November 28, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The application for the amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as
amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required
by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity for Hearing in connection with this action was published
in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 14, 1994 (59 FR 17800). No request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this
notice.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to the action and has determined not to prepare an
environmental impact statement. Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded that the
issuance of the amendment will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment (59 FR 55864, dated
November 9, 1994).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to the action see (1) the application for amendment dated October 26, 1993, and supplemented

I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Philadelphia Electric Company, et al. (PECo, the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;44
and DPR&hyph;56, which authorize operation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, (PBAPS) Units 2 and 3. The licenses
provide, among other things, that the license is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the Commission now
or hereinafter in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facility consists of two boiling water reactors located in York County, Pennsylvania.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is stated in 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors
against radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), that ``The licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite physical
protection system and security organization which will have as its objective to provide high assurance that activities
involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense and security and do not constitute an unreasonable
risk to the public health and safety.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is specified in 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), that ``The licensee shall control all
points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' It is specified in 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) that ``A numbered
picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas
without escort *&blank;*&blank;*'' It also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors)
may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon
entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area *&blank;*&blank;*''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee propose to implement an alternative unescorted access control system which would eliminate the need
to issue and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access
to keep their badge with them when departing the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to allow contractors who have unescorted access to take their badges
offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site. By letter dated September 8, 1994, the licensee requested
an exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) for this purpose.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person
or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions in this part as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger
life or property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the public interest. Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55,
the Commission may authorize a licensee to provide measures for protection against radiological sabotage provided
the licensee demonstrates that the measures have ``the same high assurance objective'' and meet ``the general performance
requirements'' of the regulation, and ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against radiological
sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the PBAPS site, unescorted access into protected areas is controlled through the use of a photograph on a combination
badge and keycard. (Hereafter, these are referred to as badge). The security officers at the entrance station use
the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The badges for both licensee employees
and contractor personnel who have been granted unescorted access are issued upon entrance at the entrance/exit location
and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and are retrievable at the entrance/exit location. In accordance
with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contractor individuals are not allowed to take badges offsite. In accordance with the plant's
physical security plan, neither licensee employee nor contractors are allowed to take badges offsite.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed system, each individual who is authorized for unescorted access into protected areas would have
the physical characteristics of their hand (hand geometry) registered with their badge number in the access control
system. When an individual enters the badge into the card reader and places the hand on the measuring surface, the system
would record the individual's hand image. The unique characteristics of the extracted hand image would be compared
with the previously stored template in the access control system to verify authorization for entry. Individuals,
including licensee employees and contractors, would be allowed to keep their badges with them when they depart the
site and thus eliminate the process to issue, retrieve and store badges at the entrance stations to the plant. Badges
do not carry any information other than a unique identification number.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other access processes, including search function capability would remain the same. This system would not be
used for persons requiring escorted access, i.e., visitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a Sandia report entitled, ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometric Identification Devices'' (SAND91_0276
US&hyph;906 Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991), and on the licensee's experience with the current photo-identification
system, the licensee stated that the false accept rate for the hand geometry system is comparable to that of the current
system. The biometric system has been in use for a number of years at several sensitive Department of Energy facilities.
The licensee will implement a process for testing the proposed system to ensure continued overall level of performance
equivalent to that specified in the regulation. The Physical Security Plan for PBAPS, Units 2 and 3, will be revised
to include implementation and testing of the hand geometry access control system and to allow licensee employees
and contractors to take their badges offsite.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee will control all points of personnel access into a protected area under the observation of security personnel
through the use of a badge and verification of hand geometry. A numbered picture badge identification system will
continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized unescorted access to protected areas. Badges will continue
to be displayed by all individuals while inside the protected area.

Since both the badges and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected areas, the proposed system
would provide for a positive verification process and the potential loss of a badge by an individual, as a result of
taking the badge offsite, would not enable an unauthorized entry into protected areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the foregoing reasons, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, the NRC staff has determined that the proposed alternative measures
for protection against radiological sabotage meet ``the same high assurance objective,'' and ``the general performance
requirements'' of the regulation and that ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against
radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation.

Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, an exemption is authorized by law, will
not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants an exemption from those requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) relating to the returning
of picture badges upon exit from the protected area such that individuals not employed by the licensee, i.e., contractors,
who are authorized unescorted access into the protected area, may take their picture badges offsite.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact (59 FR 62753).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption is effective upon issuance.

<DOCTITLE>Power Authority of the State of New York; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License,
Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendment to Facility Operating
License No. DRP&hyph;64, issued to the Power Authority of the State of New York (the licensee), for operation of Indian
Point Nuclear Generating Unit No. 3 (Indian Point 3) located in Westchester County, New York.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would revise Section 4.4 of the Indian Point 3 Technical Specifications. Specifically, TS
4.4.E.1 would be revised to allow a one-time extension to the 30-month interval requirement for leak rate testing
of Residual Heat Removal (RHR) containment isolation values AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743,
AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870. This one-time extension for leak rate testing of the RHR valves
would be deferred until prior to return to power following the current outage, which defined as prior to T
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
avg 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
exceeding 350 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilities in accordance with
the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a siginificant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the criteria of 10 CFR 50.92, the enclosed application is judged to involve no significant hazards
based on the following information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Does the proposed license amendment involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed license amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change is limited to a one-time extension of the containment isolation valve
leak rate test for RHR valves, AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870.
Testing the RHR containment isolation valves while T
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
avg 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
is above 200 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F and below 350 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F is considered to be a more practical time to test the valves because, in this configuration, the reactor coolant
pumps and steam generators can be used to remove decay heat. Additionally, the revised testing procedure required
to test the RHR containment isolation valves with T
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
avg
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 above 200 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F and below 350 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F can be performed in accordance with the current Technical Specifications. Therefore, the probability of
a previously evaluated accident is not significantly increased. The consequences of a previously evaluated accident
would not be significantly increased because each of the three RHR lines associated with valves AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741,
AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870 has redundant isolation barriers and
is supplied by the IVSWS [isolation valve seal water system] which would minimize any leakage past the isolation barriers.
Further, due to the periodic surveillance that ensures that leakage from RHR components located outside containment
does not exceed two gallons per hour, even if significant leakage past the RHR containment isolation valves occurred,
this would not significantly affect off-site exposures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Does the proposed license amendment create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed license amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident
previously evaluated. The proposed change does not introduce new accident initiators or failure mechanisms since
the change does not alter the physical characteristics of any plant system or component. The change is limited to a
one-time extension to the leak rate test interval for RHR valves AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743,
AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Does the proposed amendment involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Testing the RHR containment
isolation valves while T
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
avg
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is above 200 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F and below 350 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F is considered to be a more practical time to test the valves because, in this configuration, the reactor coolant
pumps and steam generators can be used to remove decay heat. Additionally, the revised testing procedure required
to test the RHR containment isolation valves with T
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
avg
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 above 200 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F and below 350 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F can be performed in accordance with the current Technical Specifications. Therefore, there is not a significant
reduction in a margin of safety. With respect to containment integrity, there is not a significant reduction in a margin
of safety because each of the three RHR lines associated with valves AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743,
and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870 has redundant isolation barriers and is supplied by the IVSWS
which would minimize any leakage past the isolation barriers. The most recent test results associated with valves
AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870 show that
the leak rates of the valves were well within the acceptance criteria of the tests. Further, due to the periodic surveillance
that ensures that leakage from RHR components located outside containment does not exceed two gallons per hour, even
if significant leakage past the RHR containment isolation valves occurred, this would significantly affect off-site
exposures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendments until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facilities, the Commission may issue the license amendments before the expiration
of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendments involve no significant
hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the
Commission take this action, it will publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information
and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,
and should cite the publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

 notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11545 Rockville Pike, Rockville,
Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the
NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By January 12, 1995, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendments to the subject
facility operating licenses and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the White Plains Public Library, 100 Martine Avenue, White
Plains, New York 10601. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission
or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors: (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the bases of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
The petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above
date. Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to Michael J. Case: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was
mailed, plant name, and publication date and page number of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Mr. Charles M. Pratt, 10 Columbus Circle, New York, New York 10019, attorney for the licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(l)(i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed
rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be
examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B),
and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The purpose of this rule change is to establish a single service offering comprised of the existing Nasdaq Level 1 (``Level
1'') quotation and Last Sale Information (``Last Sale'') services. The monthly charge to be levied for the consolidated
service will be $19/terminal, the sum of the monthly charges currently assessed for receipt of the Last Sale and Level
1 services on an authorized terminal device. Hence, this rule proposal does not entail an increase in the subscriber
charges for the individual constituent services; however, its implementation will result in higher fees for some
Level 1 subscribers who do not currently pay for receipt of last sale data.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The two services covered by this proposal are distributed by commercial vendors of market data pursuant to contracts
with The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (``NSMI''), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the NASD.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Vendors distribute the data via their respective networks to the end users who pay the established charge levied by
NSMI for receipt of the quotation and transaction information. The existence of separate service categories for
quotation and transaction data traces to the evolution of The Nasdaq Stock Market (``Nasdaq''). From its inception
in 1971, Nasdaq provided quotation information on a real-time basis for vendor distribution. In 1982, the NASD implemented
rules requiring member firms to report individual transactions in the top tier of Nasdaq listings within 90 seconds
of execution. Later, this reporting regime was extended to Nasdaq SmallCap issues, Nasdaq convertible debt issues,
and equity issues traded exclusively over-the-counter (``OTC''). In 1991, the universe of quotation data available
to Level 1 subscribers was expanded to include real-time quotations entered by OTC market makers utilizing the OTCBB
service. The instant proposal would combine the real-time quotation and transaction data for Nasdaq and OTC issues,
respectively, into a single service distributed by vendors for which their subscribers will pay a single monthly
charge of $19/terminal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NASD posits that this proposal will produce benefits to vendors as well as their customers. First, it will simplify
the billing process by eliminating the need to separately identify and track those terminals receiving one or the
other covered service. This should minimize the potential for billing disputes between vendors and their customers,
and simplify the process by which vendors authorize (or deauthorize) subscriber devices for receipt of real-time
quotation and transaction information on Nasdaq and OTC issues, Second, it will increase market transparency by
ensuring that all subscribers to NSMI's comprehensive quotation data (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the quotations on Nasdaq and OTCBB issues that Level 1 subscribers currently receive) will receive trade-by-trade
information for the same universe of quoted securities. Thus, the vendors' customers will automatically have access
to more expansive data that can be used to gauge market trends and facilitate investment decisions. And third, implementation
of this proposal will materially advance NSMI's efforts to simplify and update its fee structure, with a view toward
reducing the administrative burdens and costs incurred by vendors that distribute quotation and transaction data
from the Nasdaq and OTC markets, respectively.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In this regard, the NASD notes that the SEC previously approved a similar initiative that linked the subscription
of quotation and transaction data services for New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') listed issues and established
unified subscriber fees. This was accomplished by certain amendments to the Consolidated Tape and Consolidated
Quotation Plans.

Release No. 34&hyph;24130 (February 20, 1987); 52 FR 6413 (March 3, 1987). While the NYSE initiative resulted in decreased
payments for a majority of subscribers with one display device, the Commission noted that some subscribers with one
display device would pay increased charges and that certain smaller firms that had currently received transaction
information only would experience a fee increase. The Commission, in its approval order encouraged the CTA and CQ
Plan participants to monitor the operation of its revised structure to determine if relief for smaller firms is practicable.

The NASD and NSMI believe that that proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of Section 15A(b)(5)
of the Act. Section 15A(b)(5) specifies that the rules of a national securities association shall provide for the
equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members, issuers and other persons using any
facility or system that the association operates or controls. The proposed change in fee structure effects the consolidation
of two existing services into a single service, priced at the current levels of the constituent services. As such,
the proposal does not constitute a fee increase for those subscribers receiving the most comprehensive service.
However, its implementation will require that Level 1 subscribers who had not previously received last sale data
also pay for receipt of complete last sale data. In terms of the universe of Level 1 terminals currently supported,
this segment accounts for about 6.5% of the terminal population. It should be noted that this percentage has been declining
in recent years, apparently reflecting the enhanced value of last sale data that now includes all Nasdaq-listed securities
and thousands of OTC equity securities. The NASD believes that the additional cost of $9.75 that some subscribers
will incur will be partially offset by the administrative savings.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 In particular, large subscribers will no longer have to verify the accuracy of billings by tracking terminals that
receive only one of the covered services. Administrative savings should also accrue to vendors with large populations
of subscribers receiving Nasdaq market data. Moreover, the instant proposal will effect a simplification in the
fee structure applicable to receipt of two major data services supported by NSMI.

To the extent that some small volume subscribers to the current Level 1 service do not wish to receive the consolidated
service they may subscribe to a vendor service offering the same categories of information on a delayed basis. NSMI
imposes no subscriber charge for delayed market data.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The NASD and NSMI also believe that this proposal is consistent with certain national market system objectives expressed
by Congress in adopting Section 11A(a)(1) of the Act in 1975. Specifically, the Congress found that the efficiency
of the nation's securities markets would be advanced by the broad dissemination of reliable quotation and transaction
information to brokers, dealers, and investors. In other words, the Congress sought to increase market transparency
by fostering opportunities for electronic delivery of current market data to the constituencies served by the various
securities markets. The NASD submits that its proposal is consistent with Section 11A(a)(1) because it will optimize
the distribution of real-time quotation and transaction data from the Nasdaq and OTC markets to market professionals
handling customer orders. As a result, registered representatives using desk-top terminals to supply current market
data on Nasdaq or OTC equities will automatically be able to furnish their customers with insider bids/offers as well
as last sale prices for these securities. Hence, consolidation of the Level 1 and Last Sale services translates to
expanded access to market data for retail investors who depend on their brokers for current market information  Finally,
the NASD notes that the Commission previously approved amendments to the Consolidated Tape and Consolidated Quotation
Plans that effected a bundling of quotation and last sale data services (and the establishment of unified subscriber
fees) respecting NYSE-listed securities covered by these national market system plans. Based on these factors,
the NASD reiterates its belief that the instant proposal is fully consistent with the data distribution objectives
contained in Section 11A(a)(1) of the Act.

will now be held January 5, 1995, in Room 1107, 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. at the Department of State, 2201 ``C'' Street,
N.W., Washington, D.C. This meeting is being postponed because of the absence of key officials at international meetings
during December.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As previously announced, the agenda of this first formal meeting of the full ITAC committee includes: (1) presentation
and discussion of the ITAC structure, working methods, and priorities; (2) a review of the ITU Plenipotentiary Conference
held recently in Kyoto, to identify follow-on tasks; (3) status report on preparations for the 1998 Plenipotentiary,
to be hosted by the United States; and (4) the establishment of ad hoc groups to deal with specific areas of interest
(such as, to provide advice on participation in OECD, APEC and CITEL).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice is provided in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act and &sect;5.4.9 of TVA's implementing
procedures, 48 FR 19264 (1983). TVA has decided to adopt the modified preferred alternative (Alternative E) identified
in its ``Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the Natural Resources Management Plan (NRMP) at Land Between
The Lakes (LBL).'' The Final EIS was made available to the public on October 17, 1994. Under Alternative E (modified),
natural resource management will be used to enhance recreation and environmental education, with emphasis on scenic
beauty, sightseeing, wildlife viewing, and a more natural appearance of the forest. Multiple use of resources will
be allowed, including hunting, fishing and timber harvesting. The final NRMP also identifies measures to integrate
LBL's designation as a United Nations Man and the Biosphere Reserve into resource planning and management.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
LBL is a 170,000-acre tract of federal land in western Kentucky and Tennessee. It is located between Kentucky Reservoir
and Lake Barkley. The area was established in 1963. TVA manages LBL to promote recreation and environmental education.
Management of the area's natural resources is a very important element in the fulfillment of these goals. Natural
resources which are managed include forests, open lands (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 agricultural fields, wildlife openings), wildlife, and water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
TVA first developed an NRMP in 1964 and subsequently revised it several times. The NRMP was last revised in 1985. Since
then, a number of new resource management issues have arisen and there have been changes in public desires for resource
management. In addition, LBL was designated an international biosphere reserve by the United Nations in 1991. The
UN's biosphere reserve program identifies examples of the world's major managed and preserved ecosystems and emphasizes
resource conservation and research at those areas. LBL was designated a UN biosphere reserve ``to provide a research
demonstration of how preserved lands, managed lands, and man can coexist.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To obtain the public's views on new resource issues and possible changes to the management plan, TVA decided to prepare
an EIS in concert with its consideration of possible revisions to the NRMP. Following scoping, TVA released a draft
EIS and NRMP on November 10, 1993. A public hearing was held on December 14, 1993, and a 60-day period was provided for
receipt of written comments. TVA received approximately 2,900 letters and 64 statements were made at the public hearing.
After considering all comments, TVA revised the EIS appropriately. The Final EIS was distributed to commenting agencies
and the public on October 17, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternatives Considered
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of LBL's broad goals, a number of management philosophies and plans could be implemented. Consequently,
TVA purposefully formulated alternatives for the EIS that captured a reasonable range of appropriate management
approaches. Certain of the alternatives were then modified, first in response to comments received during the scoping
stage and then in response to comments received on the draft EIS. As presented in the Final EIS, the alternatives evaluated
and considered included:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative A: No Action
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Alternative A, there would be no change in the basic management guidance provided by the 1985 Natural Resources
Management Plan. Since 1985, there have been several modifications in management practices used at LBL as knowledge
has improved and new management techniques were developed. These modifications will be formally incorporated into
a revised NRMP. Aside from these modifications, choosing Alternative A would essentially mean taking no action because
it represents current management objectives and guidelines for LBL's natural resources. The basic management approach
for forest resources would continue commercial forest management (the removal and sale of merchantable timber)
by even-aged management, including shelterwood and clearcut harvests. However, harvest levels would be substantially
lower than annual growth, with a rotation age for hardwoods of 276 years. Approximately 13,150 acres would be designated
as biosphere reserve core area. TVA would protect water resources through use of silvicultural and agricultural
best management practices (BMPs), would manipulate water levels on selected interior ponds, and would construct
artificial wetlands to benefit shorebirds and waterfowl.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative B: Emphasis on Wildlife Management for Game Species
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Even-aged forest management practices would continue to be used, including shelterwood and clearcut harvests but
the volume of trees cut would be increased. Increasing even-aged practices would retard shade-tolerant hardwood
encroachment into LBL's forests and maintain a higher proportion of oak-hickory forest types. Oak-hickory forests
produce more mast (seeds and nuts such as acorns and hickory nuts) than other forest types. Increasing even-aged practices
also would increase the amount of young plant growth and edge communities. Both changes would benefit wildlife, especially
game species, and associated recreational activities such as hunting and wildlife viewing. Timber harvest levels
would still be less than annual growth (less wood volume would be removed than grows each year). However, the rotation
age for hardwoods would decrease to approximately 100 years. Biosphere reserve core areas would total 20,650 acres.
Water resource and wetland management would be the same as in Alternative A.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Alternative C. No Active Natural Resource Management
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Alternative C, commercial forest management would not be practiced, and natural succession would be allowed
to convert approximately 40 to 50 percent of the forest to shade-tolerant hardwoods such as maple and beech. In addition,
open land management for the purposes of creating wildlife habitat would cease, and hunting and other consumptive
recreation would not be allowed. The biosphere reserve core area would total 161,500 acres, essentially all of LBL
except those areas devoted to the interior highway system and facilities. Water level manipulation on interior ponds
would benefit waterfowl and shorebirds, but no artificial wetlands would be constructed.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Alternative D: No Active Forest Management, Hunting Allowed
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Alternative D, commercial forest management would cease as in Alternative C. However, open land management
would continue as in the past, and hunting would be allowed. Biosphere reserve core area would total 151,050 acres.
Water and wetland management would be the same as under Alternative A.

Alternative E (modified): Combination of Even-Aged and Uneven-Aged Forest Management With Expansion of Biosphere
Reserve Core Area
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Alternative E, even-aged forest management would be used on moist, lower slopes and bottomland habitats where
conversion to shade-tolerant species through natural succession is most likely. Uneven-aged forest management
practices would be used on upper slopes and ridges where conversion is less likely to occur. The goal of both management
systems would be to maintain a high proportion of healthy, vigorous oak-hickory forest stands. For aesthetic reasons,
clearcuts would not be used. To further reduce aesthetic impacts, final shelterwood harvests would be deferred for
20 to 40 years following the initial harvest. The rotation age for forests under even-aged management would be 150
years. Group selection harvests under the uneven-aged system would be limited to about one acre or less in size. Although
set rotations would not apply to uneven-aged management, hardwood trees would be allowed to reach an age of 150 to 200
years. Open land management would continue as in the past; however, any open lands within biosphere reserve core areas
would be allowed to revert to forest. Biosphere reserve core areas would be increased to a total of 42,500 acres. Water
level and wetland management would be the same as under Alternative A.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Preferred Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Final EIS identified Alternative E as TVA's preferred alternative. In TVA's opinion, Alternative E represents
an environmentally balanced approach which best provides for the recreational and educational goals of LBL. This
approach is largely consistent with and builds upon the management approach currently in use at LBL (Alternative
A). It provides for increased outdoor recreation and environmental education opportunities but does so in the context
of ecologically sound natural resource management.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under Alternative E, active forest and wildlife management would occur at reduced level's compared to the no action
alternative (Alternative A). However, the forest should have a more natural appearance compared to alternatives
A and B_a difference which TVA's analyses indicate is preferred by the general public. A larger biosphere reserve
core area would enhance conditions for those species which benefit from unfragmented forest blocks and closed canopies.
This would include forest interior neotropical migratory birds which are of current concern. There are a number of
other attributes that make Alternative E preferable:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
TVA received a substantial number of comments that supported the more aggressive timber harvesting activities allowed
under Alternatives A and B. TVA agrees that Alternative A has been a successful management strategy in the past at LBL,
particularly in the area of enhancing wildlife habitat. As a result, even-aged forest management, a critical component
of Alternative A, has been included in Alternative E although at reduced levels. Even-aged forest management will
help to meet the long-term needs of early successional wildlife species by increasing the amount of young plant growth.
Even-aged management is more effective in maintaining the oak-hickory forest of the area. However, the public's
perception of even-aged management is generally negative and there is less acceptance of this than in the past, particularly
on public lands. The reduced use of even-aged management under Alternative E attempts to strike a balance between
the ecological benefits of even-aged management and the public's perceptions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TVA also agrees with commenters that Alternative B would represent sound resource management from a biological standpoint.
However, increasing the level of even-aged timber management would have negative visual impacts and is not desirable
for that reason. In addition, as pointed out by a number of commenters, LBL offers the opportunity to maintain a large
block of mature forest in a region where most private forests are fragmented and other tracts of public land are small
in size.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A number of comments were received that supported an end to commercial forest management activities (the harvesting
of commercially-usable timber) on all of LBL. This would occur under Alternatives C and D. As stated in TVA's EIS, Alternative
C or D would be consistent with and help advance LBL's broad goals. However, over the long term, these alternatives
are expected to change 40 to 50 percent of the stands in LBL's forests from oak-hickory to beech-maple. Oak-hickory
species are better mast producers and many wildlife species rely on mast for food. In addition, wildlife species which
depend on early-successional vegetative habitats would be adversely impacted by the change to mature, old-growth
forest. There is also likely to be a decline in overall visitation under Alternatives C and D because of adverse effects
on hunting. Under Alternative C, hunting would be eliminated. Under Alternative D, the habitats preferred by certain
game species would be reduced and hunting opportunities would be adversely affected. The diversity of habitats and
associated recreational opportunities offered by Alternative E better support LBL's recreational and education
goals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmentally Preferable Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of LBL's goals of recreation and environmental education, none of the alternatives would be environmentally
destructive and none of the alternatives would likely result in significant environmental impacts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are environmental differences among alternatives. Depending on the alternative, there could be greater or
lesser impacts on certain resources and certain species. For example, Alternative C would eliminate future commercial
timber harvesting and likely eventually result in an old growth forest. This would benefit species which prefer such
habitat such as some neotropical birds. However, those neotropical birds which favor early successional vegetation
would be adversely impacted. In contrast, Alternative B, which would allow the most timber harvesting, would result
in more early successional habitat and benefit game species, such as deer, that prefer such habitats.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, depending on the habitat or species one wants to enhance or foster, any one of the alternatives evaluated
in TVA's EIS could be characterized as environmentally preferable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Environmental Consequences and Commitments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In choosing Alternative E, all practical means to avoid or minimize environmental harm have been adopted. Site-specific
environmental reviews will be conducted prior to implementation of natural resource management actions that could
potentially impact the environment. Typically, mitigation will be accomplished by avoiding sensitive areas, changes
in intensity or method of management, or providing off-setting resource enhancement or replacement at other localities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Common mitigation measures include silvicultural and agricultural BMPs to ensure that minimal amounts of soil and
nutrients enter any water course. Other mitigation measures include archaeological and historic surveys, use of
integrated pest management techniques, and implementation of visual quality zones. Wildlife management mitigation
includes bat management zones and eagle nest management zones. To address the issues of fragmentation and biological
diversity, large blocks of biosphere reserve core acreage are an integral part of Alternative E.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results of implementing Alternative E will be continuously monitored to determine if management objectives
are being achieved. The results of forest and open land management activities will be monitored through the use of
forest inventories, logging inspections, annual mast surveys, and use of gypsy moth traps among other activities.
Management impacts on wildlife are monitored through periodic surveys of bats, breeding and wintering birds, eagles,
grouse, turkeys, and deer, as well as through hunter harvest data and wildlife disease surveillance activities.
Water and soil will also be monitored through testing and survey activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Innovative natural resource management is crucial to the fulfillment of LBL's mission and to TVA's role in environmental
leadership. TVA believes this plan will further the recreation and environmental education mission of LBL. At the
same time, this plan will maintain and enhance a nationally significant tract of public land in western Kentucky and
Tennessee.

Chrysler Corporation; Decision on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petition for Determination of Inconsequential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Noncompliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chrysler Corporation (Chrysler) of Auburn Hills, Michigan, determined that some of its vehicles failed to comply
with the outside mirror requirements of 49 CFR 571.111, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 111, ``Rearview
Mirrors,'' and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Chrysler
also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) (now 49 U.S.C. 30118, 30120) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle
safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on May 17, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 25699).
This notice grants Chrysler's petition with respect to some of the noncomplying motor vehicles and denies it with
respect to the remainder. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph S7.1 of FMVSS No. 111 requires that trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of more than 10,000 pounds
have outside mirrors of unit magnification. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the 1989 through early-1994 model years, Chrysler manufactured an estimated total of 26,700 Dodge Ram 350
and 3500 pickup trucks and cab/chassis with convex, passenger-side, outside, rearview mirrors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chrysler supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following (Chrysler also submitted
two figures which compared the fields of view of the noncompliant mirrors to two types of compliant mirrors. This material
is available in the NHTSA docket):

(1) The affected vehicles are also equipped with a driver side outside rear view mirror of unit magnification and,
except for the less than 100 cab/chassis models, an inside rear view mirror of unit magnification.

(2) The installed 6

<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; convex passenger side mirror meets all requirements of S5 of FMVSS 111 [passenger car requirements], and
provides increased field of view capability when compared to the same size mirror of unit magnification or the optional

&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; unit magnification mirror. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Other than the passenger side mirror being convex rather than unit magnification, the rear view mirror system
on the affected vehicles meets or exceeds all performance and location requirements of FMVSS 111. The system capability
is adequate in all regards, specifically including provision for both overall system and passenger side field of
view. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Chrysler is not aware of any owner complaints, field reports or allegations of hazardous circumstances relating
to performance of the passenger side mirror on the affected vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The subject condition occurred as the result of the upgrading of a model for the 1989 model year to more than 10,000
pounds GVWR. That model for prior model years had been equipped with a convex passenger side mirror and unit magnification
driver side and inside rear view mirrors. The same mirror system was carried over on the vehicles for which the GVWR
was upgraded. Rear view adequacy of the convex mirror was not affected by the GVWR increase, and the need to instead
release a unit magnification mirror for compliance to the FMVSS 111 requirement at the upgraded GVWR was inadvertently
overlooked at the time and thereafter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) From a practical vehicle operation and motor vehicle safety standpoint, the mirror system which fully complied
to all FMVSS 111 requirements on earlier model year vehicles was equivalently effective and capable on the upgraded
GVWR vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Existence of the variance was detected during an engineering analysis resulting from a question of mirror size
adequacy on certain 1994 subject models. Size was determined to not be a concern, but the analysis uncovered the convex
mirror issue. Chrysler then took immediate, expedited action to correct the condition by specifying and installing
the optional 10

Existence of the subject condition was totally inadvertent and not a deliberate attempt to evade Federal Motor Vehicle
Safety Standard requirements. Therefore, in spite of good faith and due care efforts by Chrysler, some vehicles with
a GVWR of more than 10,000 pounds were manufactured and shipped with a convex passenger side outside rear view mirror.
Upon discovery of the condition, Chrysler took immediate action to correct it in production and minimize the number
of vehicles produced with the convex mirror.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No comments were received on the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has reviewed FMVSS No. 111 and Chrysler's arguments. The reason that convex magnification mirrors are permitted
for passenger side mirrors on vehicles whose GVWR is less than 10,000 pounds and not for heavier vehicles is that when
a vehicle is very large it is important for its operator to be able to look in the mirrors to see the vehicle and its immediate
surroundings when in motion. For example, if an operator is attempting to back a longer vehicle into a confined space,
a mirror of unit magnification will give a view which is undistorted, thus reducing the chances that the vehicle will
collide with anything in its path due to an error in perception by the operator. A convex mirror yields a slightly distorted
perspective of the surroundings in order to obtain a larger field of view. This distortion could produce adverse effects
if the vehicle is very long. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Chrysler stated that the rearview adequacy of the convex mirrors was not affected by the upgrade in GVWR. This change
consisted of adding an extra wheel to the rear axle on each side of the vehicle in order to give it a greater load capacity.
While this does increase the width of the vehicle to 93 inches, the modification adds nothing to the length of the truck,
and should not affect the ability of the operator to judge the driving environment to the rear and side of the truck.
NHTSA has concluded, therefore, that safety does not require that the vehicles be refitted with a convex mirror on
the passenger side. However, this conclusion applies to the completed vehicles only. With respect to the 90 cab/chassis
that have been produced with the noncompliant mirror, NHTSA notes that these incomplete vehicles could have a number
of types of bodies added by a final stage manufacturer, such as ambulance, cargo compartment, and cherry picker. Because
of the variance in possible equipment which could be added to the chassis, there is no way to assess the effect on safety
of the noncompliance on the completed vehicle. Because these vehicles could be completed in a way which could significantly
obstruct a vehicle operator's view, it is impossible to decide that the noncompliance is inconsequential with respect
to them, and NHTSA believes that they should be equipped with a unit magnification mirror as the standard requires.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In consideration of the foregoing, the Administrator has decided that Chrysler has met its burden of persuasion with
respect to the 26,610 completed pickup trucks described in its petition, and that the noncompliance of these vehicles
with FMVSS No. 111 is inconsequential as it relates to safety. Accordingly, with respect to the completed pickup trucks,
the Administrator exempts Chrysler from the notification requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30118 and the remedy requirements
of 49 U.S.C. 30120. The Administrator has further decided that Chrysler has not met its burden of persuasion with respect
to the 90 cab/chassis incomplete vehicles described in the petition, and denies Chrysler's petition with respect
to these motor vehicles.

<DOCTITLE>Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company; Grant of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company (Uniroyal) of Greenville, South Carolina, determined that some of its tires failed
to comply with 49 CFR 571.109, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 109, ``New Pneumatic Tires,'' and
filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' Uniroyal also petitioned
to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_Motor Vehicle Safety on the
basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of receipt of the petition was published on July 19, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR 36832).
This notice grants Uniroyal's petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph S4.3.3(b) of FMVSS No. 109 specifies that each tire be labeled with an identification number, the last three
digits of which represent the week and year of manufacture. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the period of the 17th through the 20th week of 1994, Uniroyal manufactured approximately 2,800 P175/70R13
MOTOMASTER LE tires with an incorrect week and year of manufacture contained in the tire identification number. The
last three digits in the identification numbers on the subject tires are incorrectly marked ``167,'' ``168,'' ``169,''
and ``120.'' The last three digits in the identification numbers for these tires should be ``174,'' ``184,'' ``194,''
and ``204'' signifying the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th weeks of 1994. All tires are sold only in the replacement market.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uniroyal supported its petition for inconsequential noncompliance with the following:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
[Uniroyal does] not believe that this error will impact motor vehicle safety since only the week and year of manufacture
is incorrect. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Uniroyal offered further rationale in its Part 573 Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The dates marked on these tires could be interpreted as the year 1987 through 1990 or 1997 through 2000. This tire line
was introduced during the fourth quarter of 1992; therefore, there would not be pre-existent tires with these numbers.
In the event a recall is necessary prior to the week and year (years 1997 through 2000) marked on these tires, there will
be no tires that were actually manufactured during these weeks. If it is necessary to recall these tires during or after
the weeks marked, the recall population would comprise both the mismarked and properly marked tires.

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
No comments were received on the petition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has reviewed FMVSS No. 109 and the petitioner's arguments. The primary purpose that the identification number
serves is to facilitate identification of tires that are the subject of notification and remedy campaigns. The erroneous
date code marking does not affect the ability to identify the tires in the event a campaign is conducted either before
or after the erroneously indicated manufacture date. If a recall campaign is required on the tires before the 16th
week of 1997, their date code, like any tire's conforming date code, permits instant identification of a tire in the
recall population. Should a campaign be required on tires of this tire line manufactured during the 16th weeks of 1997,
1998, and 1999, and the 12th week of 2000, or on the tires in question, the petitioner will have to campaign both sets
of tires, compliant tires as well as noncompliant ones, but this is a burden to be borne by the petitioner and does not
affect safety in a negative way. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In consideration of the foregoing, the Administrator has decided that Uniroyal has met its burden of persuasion and
that the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. Accordingly, the Administrator
exempts Uniroyal from the notification requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30118, and the remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C.
30120.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to the authorizing legislation, programs must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced
and representative of the diversity of American political, social, and cultural life. ``Diversity'' should be interpreted
in the broadest sense and encompass differences including but not limited to race, gender, religion, geographic
location, socio-economic status, and physical challenges. Applicants are strongly encouraged to adhere to the
advancement of this principle.

Overview
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Participants should receive advanced training in EFL: course and curriculum design, teacher training and management
skills, evalution and testing, with an intensive American Studies component. Special emphasis should be placed
on incorporating American Studies materials into an intercultural curriculum. Since this will be the first U.S.
experience for many of the participants, the program should introduce the participants to U.S. life, institutions,
values, and culture through classes, field trips, contacts with Americans, and community activities. The program
should maintain a relative balance among discussion sessions, workshops, and practical experience and promote
interaction among the participants. The project should also include an individual research project for each participant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Approximately 30 Brazilian nationals who are full time employees at a Binational Center in Brazil will participate
in this program. Each participant is nominated by his/her institution for final selection by United States Information
Service (USIS). Participants either teach English as a Foreign Language, administer English or American Studies
programs, or provide teacher training in either English or American Studies. Participants will come on ``B1&hyph;B2''
visas issued by U.S. Consular Officers at American Embassy or Consulates in Brazil. USIS Brasilia will provide the
university with biographical and professional data on each candidate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposal should specifically address the following technical requirements:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
U.S. Pre-Program Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After receiving the final participant list, the university is expected to do the following: send USIS a pre-departure
information packet containing welcome and general information with practical suggestions for preparing the participants
for their stay at the university. The participants will arrive directly at the program site from their home cities.
The university program staff will be expected to make arrangements to have participants met upon arrival at the airport
nearest the university campus. A substantive orientation should be provided shortly after all the participants'
arrival at the university. The purpose of the orientation is to provide detailed information concerning the program,
university, community, etc. It should also acquaint participants with one another, the university program, and
the administrative staff. During this orientation a brief needs assessment is to be conducted to determine individual
learning needs and to identify the topic of the individual research project. The Institute Director should be prepared
to adjust program content, emphasis, and schedule as necessary to respond to participants' concerns.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Educational Development
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The educational development program should be a non-credit, intensive program of approximately 40 hours a week designed
to meet the stated program objectives through interactive lectures and discussions, workshops, and hands-on learning
experiences using university and community resources and opportunities. This course should not only emphasize
EFL teaching skills, teacher training and management skills, but also American culture and most importantly, how
to integrate the teaching of American culture in EFL classrooms. The curriculum should be designed to challenge the
participants to grow professionally. In addition, it should provide them with practical, hands-on learn-by-doing
experiences. The students should receive materials that they can immediately adapt to their BNC classes in Brazil.
Time should be allowed for students informally to pursue topics of personal interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Brazilian teaches participating in this program are among the best English teachers in Brazil. Most already have
a highly developed background in EFL based on years of teaching experience and exposure to materials and specialists
from the U.S. Thus, the entire program should reflect the high academic level, sophistication and professional development
of the participants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Proposal should contain evidence of on-going evaluation and ability to make program adjustments, as well as evaluation
of the entire program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
The Cultural Enrichment Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The two goals of the Cultural Enrichment Program are to: 1) strengthen the participants' knowledge of U.S. life and
culture through carefully designed interactive classes and community cultural activities and 2) provide an insight
into the use of ``cultural material'' in the classroom. The relationship between language and culture should be explored.
The cultural component of the program should allow students to explore the variety of American culture in both small
towns and larger cities, experience the richness of the visual and performing arts in the U.S., and interact with local
citizens.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Program Administration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All Institute programming and administrative logistics, the management of the Educational Development Program
and the Cultural Enrichment Program, local transportation, on-site university arrangements (including housing,
host-families, ordering and shipping of educational materials, general program support, etc.) and maintaining
current information regarding Internal Revenue Service regulations will be the responsibility of the Institute
grantee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants should be housed in the same facility, preferably a modern dormitory with no more than two persons to
a room, adequately climate-controlled for the area and sufficient bathroom facilities. Three hot meals a day must
be provided. Extra-curricular activities such as field trips, Fourth of July celebrations, brief homestays and
other social and recreational activities should be provided. Each participant will arrive with valid U.S. health
insurance. Describe the available health and/or local health care system and plan to provide health care access.
Transportation to and from the airport and local transportation between the cultural activities must be provided.

Grant will begin May 15, 1995. Note: the participants will arrive in July, 1995. The grant start date allows for time
to prepare for the students' arrival. No funds may be expended until the grant agreement is signed.

Goals
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The goals of the program include providing an overview of the state of the art of American EFL, identifying sources

 Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 for public housing development and major reconstruction
of obsolete public housing (MROP) activities designated for disabled families; invitation for applications.

</ACTION>
<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 624 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (HCD Act of 1992) requires the Department to set aside
not less than 5 percent of amounts approved for public housing development and MROP activities in the FY 1993 and 1994
appropriations acts for designated housing for disabled families. Section 622 of the 1992 Act amends section 7 of
the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 (USHA), and sets forth the requirements for designating housing for elderly families,
disabled families, and elderly 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
disabled families. (The final rule to implement the provisions of section 7 of the USHA was published on April 13, 1994.)
These set-asides are to be used only for the costs of development of, or MROP activities in connection with, housing
designated for occupancy under section 7. The competition for these set-aside funds will be based upon (1) the need
of the PHA for assistance (taking into consideration the allocation plan submitted), and (2) the extent to which the
projects/buildings meet the requirements of section 7(e) (i.e., the allocation and supportive service plans).
Note: Pursuant to section 624(B) of the HCD Act of 1992, no building selected by the PHA for designated housing for disabled
families under this NOFA may contain more than 25 units unless the applicant demonstrates a need for a building with
more than 25 units that cannot otherwise be met by a building with 25 units or less. Designation of a portion of a project
does not require that the buildings, floors or units be contiguous; PHAs are encouraged to place units in the most integrated
setting possible. In general, HUD will approve designated projects for disabled families only if there is a clear
demonstration that there is both a need and a demand by disabled families for such designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Attached as Appendices A and B to this NOFA are the 1994 NOFA for Public Housing Development (published on May 24, 1994)
and the NOFA for 1993 and 1994 MROP activities (published on May 20, 1994). The requirements set forth in these NOFAs
that are applicable to public housing development and MROP activities apply to designated housing for disabled families
unless otherwise indicated in this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NOFA announces the availability of the set-asides for public housing development and/or MROP activities applications
for designated housing for disabled families pursuant to section 7 of the USHA. The objective of development/MROP
activities funding for designated housing for disabled families is to assist PHAs to meet the goals set forth in their
allocation plans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A PHA's project(s) for disabled families must be designated before the development/MROP applications can be selected
for funding under this NOFA. Thus, the PHA must have an approved allocation plan that includes the designated project
as a housing resource. The PHA also must have an approved supportive service plan for the project(s) that has been designated
for disabled families. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allocation plans (including those with supportive service plans) may be submitted at any time. However, if a PHA anticipates
responding to this NOFA, it should submit its allocation plan and supportive service plan in sufficient time for them
to be approved before the PHA files its development/MROP application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NOFA is not applicable to the Indian housing program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This NOFA is open-ended and applications will be accepted at the HUD Field Office Public Housing Division any time
after publication of this NOFA until all available set-aside funds for both development and MROP activities are utilized.
Applications will be considered in the order received. When an application is submitted to the Field Office, the PHA
must clearly write ``PUBLIC HOUSING (DISABLED) APPLICATION'' on the outside of the envelope.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 -->
A. Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Sections 5 and 23 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA) (42 U.S.C. 1437c and 1437u); sec. 7(d) of the Department
of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)); and sections 622 and 624 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (HCD Act of 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public housing development regulations are codified in 24 CFR part 941, and the designated housing final rule was
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17652). The rule will be codified at 24 CFR part 945 (``Designated Housing'' regulations).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Fund Availability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HCD Act of 1992 required the Department to set aside not less than 5 percent of public housing development and MROP
activities amounts approved in the FY 1993 and 1994 appropriations acts for designated housing for disabled families.
Accordingly, $20 million was set aside in FY 1993 and a maximum of $21.78 million was set aside in FY 1994 for public housing
development; a maximum of $8.96 million was set aside from the FY 1993 and 1994 appropriations for MROP activities.
Thus, a maximum of $50.74 million may be made available under this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Fund Assignments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act of 1974) requires that funds be allocated
on a fair share basis, except for (a) amounts retained in a Headquarters Reserve and (b) appropriations determined
incapable of geographic allocation. Since the purpose of the allocation is to encourage PHAs to designate units for
occupancy by disabled families and the extent of interest is not predicable by formula, the Department does not intend
to fair share these funds. This determination was made on the basis of statutory set-aside, pursuant to 24 CFR 791.403(b)(1)(ii)(C).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Regulations and NOFA Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Conformity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
While conformity with 24 CFR part 941 is required, this funding effort is also subject to the additional specific requirements,
consistent with the part 941 regulations, that are set forth in this NOFA, the Designated Housing final rule (59 FR
17652), and the FSS interim and final regulations published on May 27, 1993 at 58 FR 30858 and 58 FR 30906, respectively,
codified at 24 CFR part 962. Applicants also should consult Handbook 7417.1 REV&hyph;1. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A PHA preparing an application for public housing development or MROP activities for designated housing for disabled
families must (1) review Appendices A and B to this NOFA for requirements pertaining to the application process, threshold
approvability, Field Office processing, rating panel and criteria, checklist, and (2) follow the applicable instructions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the requirements set forth in Appendices A and B, the following provisions are applicable to applicants:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Applications may be submitted to the HUD Field Office anytime after publication of this NOFA, as provided in the
``Application Submission'' section of this NOFA.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. The PHA application cover letter must indicate the date the PHA's allocation and supportive services plans for
housing for disabled families have been or will be submitted to the Field Office for approval. If the allocation and
supportive service plans have not been filed, the Field Office shall advise the PHA that the development/MROP activities
application cannot be approved unless the plans are approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applications will be determined approvable if they successfully pass the minimum approvable score of 182 points
for development applications and 140 points for MROP applications. Section 624 requires that applications be selected
competitively based on (1) the PHA's need for funds to meet the goals expressed in its allocation plan; and (2) the extent
to which applications meet the requirements of 24 CFR part 945 (which contains the Designated Housing regulations).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Field Offices will prepare analyses of allocation and supportive service plans and of applications by furnishing
narrative responses to the following items: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Need of the PHA for assistance, taking into account the number of disabled families who are potential residents
of the project based on waiting lists, local surveys of accessible housing needs, the needs assessment (see 24 CFR
8.25), a housing survey, a survey of agencies providing services to persons with disabilities, the average length
of vacancy for accessible units and the length of time a disabled family has to wait for a dwelling unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Extent that appropriate supportive services will be provided, indicating that prospective residents want the
supportive services, that the services are adequately designed to meet the needs of disabled residents, and the experience
of the service provider(s) in administering an effective service delivery program for disabled families. If residential
supervision is required, the Field Office shall indicate that a written commitment has been obtained for such service.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Field Office Reports. The Field Office Public Housing Division shall forward each approvable application to the
Headquarters Panel within two weeks of the end of the deficiency ``cure'' period. The Field Office report will include
the project number, total number of units and units by bedroom size, structure type(s), cost areas, funding required,
the metropolitan/ non-metropolitan designations for each application, and the rating score sheets; in addition,
the report is to describe how the application supports the PHA allocation and supportive service plans, and whether
the PHA intends to develop the housing for disabled families on scattered sites or in a manner designed to obtain the
most integrated setting possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Approvable applications will be referred to the Headquarters Review Panel, which will be convened on an ad hoc basis.
This Panel will be comprised of Headquarters staff and will retain the same individuals, to the extent possible, each
time the Panel convenes to ensure continuity. The Headquarters Review Panel will review and rank applications based
on Field Office rating score sheets, analyses, comments and recommendations. The Assistant Secretary will select
applications based on the Headquarters Review Panel's rankings and recommendations, up to the amounts available
under the two set asides.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
 This NOFA announces the availability of FY 1994 funding, and invites eligible public housing agencies (PHAs) to submit
applications for public housing development. Applications are limited to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Replacements for demolition/disposition subject to section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Replacements for homeownership transfers under the HOPE I Program, and homeownership sales under section 5(h)
of the USHA; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural and other disasters; housing needs resulting from emergencies,
as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters; housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation;
and housing in support of desegregation efforts; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) ``Other'' applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All successful applicants will be required to participate in the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, unless
granted an exception. This NOFA also provides instructions regarding the preparation and processing of applications.
The Department is also encouraging applicants to form ``partnerships'' consisting of cooperative arrangements
with community-based entities to provide housing, and is encouraging PHAs to engage in ``mixed income'' development
(wherein public housing units are integrated within market-rate developments). This is being done by providing
additional points for such efforts (see sections III.E.5 and IV.E. of this NOFA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This NOFA is not applicable to the Indian housing program.

B. Fund Availability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriation Act
of 1994 (Pub.L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 28, 1993) (1994 Appropriations Act) makes available up to $598 million
of budget authority (grants) for public housing development/Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Public Housing (MROP)
under section 5(a)(2) of the USHA. Since some of the appropriated funds are to be derived from the recapture of prior
year obligations, the actual amount available may be less. At the beginning of Fiscal Year (FY) 1994, the available
amount was $542,796,616, which included $149,534 in available carryover funds. As recaptures of funds within the
Annual Contributions account occur during the fiscal year, these amounts will be made available for allocation to
public housing development up to the fully appropriated amount, plus carryover. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with section 624 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub.L. 102&hyph;550, approved
October 28, 1992) (HCD Act of 1992), HUD has established a set-aside of five percent of appropriated funds (up to $29,900,000
depending on recaptures) for the development of housing designated for disabled families, and up to $119,200,000
(depending on recaptures) for activities involving MROP activities. Applications for designated housing for disabled
families and for MROP activities will be the subject of separate NOFAs to be published by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of funds for replacement housing subject to section 18 of the USHA is limited to the lesser of 30 percent of the
amount appropriated for development or $150 million. One half of one percent of the appropriated amount (up to $2,990,000)
has been set aside for technical assistance and inspections. Units transferred or sold to residents under HOPE I or
section 5(h) are subject to replacement in accordance with section 304(g) of the USHA. Based on experience, the Department
will provide up to $76,059,534 for such replacements. The balance of funds will be fair shared.

C. Fund Assignments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act of 1974) requires that funds be allocated
on a fair share basis, except for (a) amounts identified as Headquarters Reserve and (b) amounts determined incapable
of geographic allocation. The amounts identified by category below are maximums. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Headquarters Reserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Threshold-approvable applications for housing resulting from unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural
and other disasters; housing needs resulting from emergencies, as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters;
housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation; and housing in support of desegregation efforts shall
be assigned Headquarters Reserve funding. (Headquarters Reserve amounts are limited in accordance with section
104 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub.L. 101&hyph;235, approved December
15, 1989), to five percent of the financial assistance that becomes available under the USHA and section 101 of the
HUD Act of 1965. Thus, Headquarters Reserve funding decisions will be made by Headquarters and may affect the distribution
of grant authority shown above.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Fair Share 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Depending on recaptures, up to $220 million will be fair shared to approve category 4 (``other'') applications. These
fair share funds will be distributed to Areas (formerly Regions) on the basis of the following fair share factors,
which reflect the most recent decennial census data as to population, poverty, housing overcrowding, housing vacancies,
amount of substandard housing, and other measurable conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of errors in FY 1993 in calculating category 4 scores under the June 28, 1993, NOFA (58 FR 34670) for the Laconia
Housing and Redevelopment Authority (LHRA) in New Hampshire and the Nahunta Housing Authority (NHA) in Georgia,
fair share funds in the amounts of $753,400 and $759,400, respectively, will be awarded from the fair share amounts
provided to the New England and Southeast Area before making FY 1994 selections, and assigned to the LHRA and NHA applications.
The correction of these errors shall not adversely affect their participation in the FY 1994 rating and ranking process.
If a new application is filed by the LHRA or NHA under this NOFA, they will be rated and ranked on the same basis as other
applications, as if no error had been made. Any unused assignments will be redistributed, proportional to need, among
remaining Areas with approvable unfunded ``other'' applications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fair share and Headquarters Reserve funds are also subject to the requirement of section 213 of the HCD Act of 1974 that
not less than 20 percent nor more than 25 percent of the HUD aggregate program funds covered by the statute be allocated
for use in nonmetropolitan areas. Therefore, public housing development fund allocations to select ``other'' applications
may be modified before assignment in order to ensure Departmental compliance with this statutory and regulatory
requirement (see 24 CFR 791.403(a)).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
All applications shall be submitted to the appropriate Field Office by the application deadline date. The Field Office
shall screen each application for completeness and will provide the PHA a 14-day opportunity to furnish missing technical
information or exhibits, or to correct technical mistakes. Each application will then be subjected to a ``pass/fail''
threshold examination. Approvable category 1, 2, and 3 applications will be reported to Headquarters for further
action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category 4 passing applications will be forwarded for rating to Rating Panel(s). One or more Rating Panels, comprised
of HUD Field representatives appointed by Headquarters, shall be convened for the purpose. Category 4 applications
will be rated by the Rating Panel(s) based on Field Office analyses. Headquarters will determine the funds required
to approve category 1, 2, and 3 applications and select category 4 applications based on Rating Panel ratings and recommendations.

B. Applications for New Construction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 6(h) of the USHA, new construction may be engaged in only if the PHA demonstrates to the satisfaction
of the Secretary that the cost of new construction in the neighborhood where the PHA determines the housing is needed
is less than the cost of acquisition or acquisition and rehabilitation in such neighborhood. Therefore, every application
for a new construction project (conventional or turnkey) must be accompanied by either the information described
in paragraphs B.1 and B.3 of this section, or, at the applicant's option, the information described in paragraphs
B.2 and B.3 of this section: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A PHA comparison of the costs of new construction (in the neighborhood where the PHA proposes to construct the housing)
and the costs of acquisition of existing housing or rehabilitation in the same neighborhood (including estimated
costs of lead-based paint testing and abatement); or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A PHA certification, accompanied by supporting documentation, that there is insufficient existing housing in
the neighborhood to develop housing through acquisition of existing housing or rehabilitation; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. A statement that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Although the application is for new construction, the PHA will accept acquisition of existing housing or rehabilitation,
if HUD determines the PHA cost comparison or certification of insufficient housing does not support approval of new
construction; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The application is for new construction only. (In any such case, if HUD cannot approve new construction under section
6(h) of the USHA, the application will be rejected.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 85 percent of the PHA's dwelling units (select (1), (2), or (3)):

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Will be so maintained upon completion of modernization for which funding has been awarded; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Will be so maintained upon completion of modernization for which applications are pending that have been submitted
in good faith under section 14 of the USHA (or a comparable State or local government program), and that there is a reasonable
expectation, as determined in writing by HUD, that such application would be approvable; or will be so maintained
upon completion of modernization under the Comprehensive Grant program.

3. Funding Preference in Accordance With Section 6(p) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6(p) of the USHA requires HUD to provide a funding preference for applications in areas with an inadequate
supply of housing for use by low-income families (i.e., a ``tight'' housing rental market). The implementation of
this preference shall be in accordance with the process described in Section V.A.2 of this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The PHA must furnish data relative to rental vacancy rates in the market area where the project is proposed. This
data should include a description of the data sources and methods used to obtain survey information. (It is recommended
that PHAs consult with local community development agencies relative to their housing needs before submitting applications
under this NOFA, since most of these agencies will have participated in the development of a Comprehensive Housing
Affordability Strategy (CHAS).) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Factors such as the following will provide evidence of conditions which, when taken together, will demonstrate
a pattern of inadequate supply (generally, no one factor, taken alone, is conclusive); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The current rental housing vacancy rate is at a low level (typically six percent or lower) which results in housing
not being available for families seeking rental units (unless the housing market area is not growing and, as a result,
is experiencing low levels of demand); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The annual production of rental housing units is insufficient to meet the demand arising from the increase in households,
or, where there is little or no growth, is insufficient to meet the demand arising from net losses to the available inventory;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The shortage of housing is resulting in rent increases exceeding those increases commensurate with rental housing
operating costs; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A significant number or proportion of section 8 certificate/voucher holders are unable to find adequate housing
because of the shortage of rental housing, as evidenced by PHA data showing a lower-than-average percentage of units
under lease and a longer-than-average time required to find units (typically, less than 85 percent lease up within
60 days).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The PHA must submit documentation, such as waiting list description or PHA vacancy rate data, to demonstrate need
for the proposed public housing, to assist the HUD Field Office in its determination of need and market in accordance
with Section IV.C.8.b of this NOFA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category 4 (other) applications may obtain additional rating points (see Section IV.E.8 of this NOFA) if the PHA furnishes
additional data regarding any of the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. ``Partnerships.'' PHAs are encouraged to form ``partnerships'' consisting of cooperative or contractual arrangements
with community-based entities for the purpose of developing housing so that the housing fits into the community and
is seen as an integral part of it. ``Community-based entities'' include private non-profit or for-profit entities
with experience in the development of low and moderate income housing, or that are skilled in the delivery of services
to families who are residents of public housing. ``Cooperative or contractual arrangements'' include those that
will facilitate development (including management of the units) that will enhance the long-term viability of the
development; and those arrangements that the PHA has for the delivery of services (such as child care, education,
and economic opportunities) made available to residents of public housing. The PHA should indicate who the entity
(or entities) are, the qualifications of the entity and its principals, and the role they play or will play in the development,
management, or service delivery process which will lead to better acceptance of public housing in the community.
Such cooperative arrangements require substantive involvement by the non-PHA partner in at least one of the following
areas: design, management, site selection, representation to the community, or service delivery. If the PHA proposes
to use public housing development funds to pay an entity for its role in the arrangement, a justification for sole-source
contracting in accordance with 24 CFR 85.36(d)(4) must be provided for consideration by HUD. With respect to the delivery
of services, costs for such services are not eligible to be paid from public housing development funds. The PHA must
also certify that its selection of the cooperative entity (or entities) was in compliance with State and local law.
[Note: If State/local procurement requirements cannot be complied with before the application deadline date, the
PHA may submit a statement with its application indicating that it is in the processing of arranging such a cooperative
relationship and certifying that such a relationship will comply with State and local law. In such case, within 60
days of the date of publication of this NOFA,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 the PHA must: (1) identify the entity(ies) proposed to be part of the cooperative relationship; (2) describe the qualifications
of the entity(ies) and of its principals, and the role they will play in the development, management, or service delivery
process that will lead to better acceptance of public housing in the community; (3) submit a justification for sole
source contracting in accordance with 24 CFR 85.36(d)(4) (if the PHA proposes to use public housing development funds
to pay the entity for its role in the cooperative arrangement), and a certification that the selection of the entity(ies)
was in compliance with State and local law.] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Mixed Income Development. In order to encourage the development of public housing in metropolitan areas that will
be less identifiable as public housing, PHAs are encouraged to develop units whereby public housing would be mixed
with market-rate dwellings so that they are indistinguishable. Specifically, in order to receive points for this
factor, a PHA must propose to acquire units in developments where the units require incomes that, on average, are at
or above 80 percent of median, or to acquire sites in developments where the units require incomes that, on average,
are at or above 80 percent of median. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Past compliance with section 3. The PHA may submit evidence that over the past five years it has met any commitments
made under the provisions of section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C., 1701u), as amended
from time to time, and the implementing regulations for section 3 at 24 CFR part 135. If the PHA does not have development
experience, it may instead submit evidence related to such experience with the modernization program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Proposed compliance with section 3. The PHA may submit its goals for complying with Section 3 employment and training
with regards to the public housing development application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

e. Support for local initiatives. If the application proposes a project which, as evidenced by a letter from local
officials, actively supports an area of local initiative such as a Community Development Block Grant, urban revitalization,
Enterprise Zone, or other similar local activity, or includes a commitment for a donation to the project in the event
it is selected for funding, the PHA should describe the activity.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Submission of Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cover letter of all applications must be marked with the date and time of receipt, along with the initials of the
Field Office employee accepting the application. Applications received after the date and time specified at the
beginning of this NOFA will be returned to the applicant. The PHA should obtain a ``Return receipt'' or similar evidence
of delivery when applications are delivered via other means (U.S. Mail, private mailing firms, etc.). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

B. Initial Screening
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Immediately after the deadline for receipt of applications, the Field Office will screen each application to determine
whether all information and exhibits have been submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. If any application lacks any technical information or exhibit, or contains a technical mistake, the PHA will be
advised in writing and will have 14 calendar days from the date of the issuance of HUD's notification to deliver the
missing or corrected information or documentation to the Field Office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Curable technical deficiencies relate only to items that would not improve the substantive quality of a category
4 application, relative to the ranking factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. If Form HUD 52470 (Application) is missing, the PHA's application will be considered substantively incomplete,
and therefore ineligible for further processing. If other forms are missing, such as Form HUD 50070 (Drug Free Workplace
Certification) or if there is a technical mistake, such as no signature, or an unauthorized signatory on a submitted
form, the PHA will be given an opportunity to correct the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. An application that does not meet the applicable threshold and NOFA requirements after the 14-day technical deficiency
period will be rejected from processing and determined to be unapprovable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applications proposing housing in areas also served by the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) are subject to coordination
with FmHA to assure that assisted housing resources to be provided are not duplicative. The State FmHA office shall
be advised that an application for public housing has been received and is being considered for funding, and be provided
an opportunity to comment on the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The responsibility for submitting a complete application rests with the PHA. The failure of the Field Office to
identify and provide a notice of deficiency to the PHA shall not relieve the PHA of the consequences of failure to submit
a complete application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

After initial screening and upon expiration of the deficiency ``cure'' period, complete applications will be examined
for threshold approvability. Applications that fail one or more of the threshold criteria will be rejected from processing
and determined to be unapprovable. All applications for public housing development funds must meet the following
thresholds to be determined approvable:

Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12131) and the implementing regulation at 28 CFR part 35.
The PHA Resolution also certifies to the PHA's intent to comply with all requirements of 24 CFR part 941. These requirements
include: Nondiscrimination under the applicable civil rights laws; the requirements imposed by the Uniform Relocation
Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601&hyph;4655); the accessibility
requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and HUD's implementing regulations
at 24 CFR part 8; and section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, as amended (12 U.S.C. 1701u), and HUD's

is not approvable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. No application shall be determined to be approvable if the PHA has failed to return excess advances received during
development or modernization, or amounts determined by HUD to constitute excess financing based on a HUD-approved
Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC) or Actual Modernization Cost Certificate (AMCC), unless HUD has approved
a pay-back plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. As a result of formal administrative proceedings, there are no outstanding findings of noncompliance with civil

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. There is no adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against it by a private individual,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The Field Office must determine that the PHA has or will have the capability to develop and manage the proposed housing.
The Field Office shall determine capability based upon the PHA's overall score under the Public Housing Management
Assessment Program (PHMAP) (see 24 CFR part 901), the PHA's most recent fiscal audit, and outstanding HUD monitoring
findings. A PHA shall not be determined to lack administrative or development capability simply because it has no
recent experience in developing or managing public/assisted housing.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The Rating Panel(s) shall ensure that all category 4 applications have been properly determined to be threshold-approvable.
The Rating Panel(s) shall compile data furnished by Field Offices for category 4 (other) applications, and rate each
application based on Field Office analyses, comments, and recommendations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A list of rated applications shall be forwarded to Headquarters, with copies of Field Office reviews and recommendations,
and justifications for Rating Panel rankings. Headquarters shall not modify ratings of category 4 (``other'') applications
unless a gross error has occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Examples of ``gross errors'' include, but are not limited to, errors in calculating the vacancy rate in the proposed
community, or assigning points for development/management experience based on a PHMAP score that was successfully
appealed, or simple errors of arithmetic.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Changes in ratings shall be fully documented, and a copy of the memorandum authorizing the change (and the basis thereof)
shall be sent to the Rating Panel and to the Field Office for inclusion in the file and be made available for public inspection.
Category 4 applications shall be approved within Areas, to the extent fair share funds are assigned, as follows:

2. ``Tight Market'' Determination
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Headquarters will separate ``other'' applications (category 4) on the basis of ``tight rental housing market''
and Rating Panel ratings and Headquarters rankings, and approve them (in the following order) to the extent fair share
funds are assigned to their respective Area: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Applications within the same Area in tight rental housing markets which receive 80 or more rating points; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. All other applications in the same Area, in rank order, depending on ``metropolitan'' or ``non-metropolitan''
funding available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Reservation of Funds
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Funds will be reserved in an amount equal to the total development cost limit for the number, structure type, and size
of units being approved, ``trended'' to take into consideration the anticipated cost of construction at the time
the construction/rehabilitation contract is expected to be executed; acquisition reservations will be trended
to take into account anticipated cost variations between fund reservation and Date of Full Availability (DOFA).
The trend shall be calculated by multiplying the project total development cost limit by 6 percent (1.06), rounded
to the nearest $50. No amendment funds will be available for these projects in the future.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Partial funding of highly ranked ``other'' applications within an Area may occur (so long as such projects are determined
viable and the PHA has indicated willingness to accept fewer units) to facilitate the funding in rank order of additional
applications for highly ranked projects.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR part 50, implementing section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332).
The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.
weekdays at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Room 10276, Washington, DC 20410.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that this NOFA will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationship
with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of
government. The NOFA will provide PHAs with funding for public housing development.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that the provisions
of this NOFA do not have the potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being
within the meaning of the Order. To the extent that the funding provided through this NOFA results in additional or
improved housing, the effects on the family will be beneficial.

D. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities: The Byrd Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. (See Section II of this NOFA.) These authorities prohibit recipients
of Federal contracts, grants, or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches
of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the
awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification
regarding lobbying. Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and sub-recipients of assistance exceeding $100,000
must certify that no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.

E. Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts
the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of
housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt
of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD's regulation implementing section 13 is codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence
the Department in these ways, they are urged to read the final rule, particularly the examples contained in appendix
A of the rule. Appendix A of this rule contains examples of activities covered by this rule.

G. Prohibition Against Advance Disclosure of Funding Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act proscribes the communication of certain information by HUD employees to persons
not authorized to receive that information during the selection process for the award of assistance. HUD's regulation
implementing section 103 is codified at 24 CFR part 4. HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the
making of funding decisions are restrained by 24 CFR part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other
than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair
competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the
subject areas permitted by 24 CFR part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202)
708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is not a toll-free number.)

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 -->
 This NOFA announces the availability of FY 1993 and 1994 funding, and invites eligible public housing agencies (PHAs)
to submit development applications for MROP activities. Because the number of applications for FY 1993 funding which
received perfect scores was in excess of available funding (funding of all applications receiving a perfect score
of 90 would only have permitted funding at 40 percent of the amount requested), this NOFA withdraws the FY 1993 NOFA
published on September 13, 1993 (58 FR 47940). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The FY 1993 funding is being combined and re-announced with the FY 1994 funding under this Public Housing Development_MROP
Activities NOFA (MROP Activities NOFA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All unfunded MROP activities applications submitted in response to the FY 1993 NOFA will be returned to the PHAs for
resubmission in response to this combined FY 1993 and FY 1994 NOFA. At the option of the PHA, an application may be amended
and resubmitted, or a new MROP activities application may be submitted. No other types of applications will be accepted
under this NOFA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the FY 1994 HUD Appropriations Act (Pub.L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 28, 1993), the Department
is making available, through this NOFA, up to $119.2 million of the FY 1994 public housing development funds for MROP
activities consistent with section 111 of the Housing and Community Development (HCD) Act of 1992 (Pub.L. 102&hyph;550,
approved October 28, 1992). Because some of the appropriated funds are to be derived from recapture of prior year obligations,
a lesser amount may be available under this NOFA, unless actual recaptures during the current Fiscal Year return the
amount to the appropriated level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the $60 million of FY 1993 public housing development funds provided in the FY 1993 HUD Appropriations
Act (Pub.L. 102&hyph;389, approved October 6, 1992) for MROP activities consistent with section 111 of the HCD Act
of 1992, is also being made available.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 As noted in the September 13, 1993 FY 93 MROP Activities NOFA, the FY 1993 funds are being made available for MROP activities
in accordance with the Joint Statement of the Managers in Explanation of the Conference Agreement (see H.R. Rep. 103&hyph;165,
pg. 31) on the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1993 (Pub.L. 103&hyph;50, approved July 2, 1993).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with section 624 of the HCD Act of 1992, HUD has established a set-aside of five percent of the total of up
to $179.2 million (which provides up to $8,950,000 depending on recaptures) for MROP Activities for housing designated
for disabled families, which will be the subject of a separate NOFA to be published by the Department.

C. Fund Assignments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Funding for MROP activities is provided for the reconstruction of existing public housing, the extent of which is
not predictable by formula. Therefore, the funds provided under this NOFA will not be fair-shared. This determination
was made on the basis of the exclusion of funds as incapable of geographic allocation pursuant to 24 CFR 791.403(b)
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 4, 1993 (58 FR 41426). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Field Offices will ascertain threshold-approvability and, after Joint Review, send the threshold-approvable
applications to a review selection panel(s) comprised of representatives from various Field Offices (hereafter
referred to as ``panel(s)''). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The panel(s) shall rate and rank the threshold-approvable applications based on the criteria in Section IV.E. of
this NOFA, and provide Headquarters with a list, in rank order, reflecting the ratings. The Department, in its discretion,
may choose to select or partially fund a lower-rated application in order to increase national geographic diversity,
and/or to increase the diversity of development types (high-rise buildings of five or more stories and those which
include only low-rise buildings).

D. Eligibility
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications for public housing development_MROP activities must be submitted by PHAs eligible for development
funding which have the required local cooperation and legal authority to develop, own and operate public housing
projects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PHAs eligible under the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) (CIAP-eligible PHAs) and under the
Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP) (CGP-eligible PHAs) may apply for these funds. CIAP and CGP are hereinafter referred
to as ``modernization.'' Applications will be determined eligible using the modernization procedures outlined
in Public Housing Modernization rule 24 CFR part 968, as amended by the interim rule for Public and Indian Housing,
Revised Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program, published on March 15, 1993 (58 FR 13916), (as modified by
this NOFA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applications must meet the threshold approvability requirements in Section IV.B of this NOFA, including the following
requirements which must be addressed in the PHA's Narrative Statement accompanying its application, and will be
rated by a panel(s) on the Technical Review Factors listed in Section IV.E. of this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. A project proposed for MROP activities must have long-term viability after reconstruction and the annual contributions
contract (ACC) for the project must remain in effect for 40 years. In determining viability, the PHA must have a comprehensive
plan (funded from other sources such as CIAP, CGP, donations, etc.) for the project for which the funds for MROP activities
are being requested. The comprehensive plan for the project may be part of the PHA's comprehensive plan for modernization.
The comprehensive plan must demonstrate a strategy which will assure that the entire development will be viable for
a minimum period of 20 years. This strategy may include, but not be limited to, an estimate of the required amount needed
for rehabilitation of the remaining portion of the development to the extent any additional rehabilitation is required;
sources of funding for the additional work; any proposed demolition/disposition that may be planned; and written
evidence of local government and resident support for the strategy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. A proposed MROP activities project must be a rental (not homeownership) project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. An ``obsolete project or building'' is one that has design or marketability problems that have resulted in: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Current vacancies of more than 25 percent of the units available for occupancy; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. (1) Estimated costs of the project (including any costs for lead-based paint abatement activities) that exceed
70 percent of the total current development cost limits for new construction of similar units in the area; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The project or building has: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) An occupancy density or a building height that is significantly in excess of that which prevails in the neighborhood;
or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) A bedroom configuration that could be altered to better serve the needs of families seeking occupancy to public
housing; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Significant security problems in and around the project; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Significant physical deterioration or inefficient energy and utility systems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The deficiencies must be determined correctable under the CGP or the CIAP procedures (see 24 CFR part 968 and related
issuances), to ensure long-term viability (a useful life with full occupancy) of more than 20 years after completion
of reconstruction; the ACC for the project must remain in effect for 40 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Existing projects which consist of more than one building may have MROP activities funding in any single year limited
to one or more (less than all) of a project's buildings. Where separate portions of an existing project receive MROP
funding in different fiscal years, each portion must be given a separate MROP project number and the funds reserved
must be sufficient to complete all of the reconstruction needed to make the portion viable; in such cases, the funds
for each MROP project must be kept separate and may not be commingled. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. A combination of MROP activities and modernization funds may be used within a project, but may not be used within
the same units (or buildings, as applicable). For example, if an existing project consists of low-rise, row, and elevator
buildings, an MROP activities project could be approved to include all or some of the row units, with the balance of
units included in a modernization project. MROP funds may, however, be used in conjunction with Urban Revitalization
Demonstration funds (HOPE VI) without limitation.

7. Management improvements are an eligible cost under MROP activities to the extent that such improvements are necessary
for the viability of the project (i.e., to maintain the physical improvements resulting from the proposed redesign,
reconstruction, or redevelopment MROP activities).

in which the project is located. This approval may be obtained from the Chief Executive Officer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Conversion of units (by combining small units to make larger units or vice versa) must either be approved before
an MROP activities application involving conversion may be approved, or an application for said conversion must
have been submitted, and the cost of any conversion must be considered in the MROP activities application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Funding provided for MROP activities at a project may not be used for total demolition/disposition of that project,
but may be used for partial demolition/disposition if required to meet long-term viability; however, 75 percent
of the units in the project or portion of the project which comprises the MROP application must be reconstructed.2

 The PHA must submit the Applicant/Recipient Disclosure/Update Report (Form HUD&hyph;2880) in accordance with
the requirements of 24 CFR part 12, subpart C.

IV. Field Office Processing of Applications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Initial Screening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Immediately after the deadline for receipt of applications, the Field Office will screen each application to determine
whether all information and exhibits have been submitted; no qualitative evaluation will be made at this time. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. If an application lacks any technical information or exhibit, or contains a technical mistake, the PHA will be advised
in writing and will have 14 calendar days from the date of the issuance of HUD's notification to deliver the missing
or corrected information or documentation to the Field Office. For example, the PHA Narrative Statement must address
each of the technical review factors under Section IV.E., the eligibility criteria under Section I.D. and the restriction
criteria under Section I.E. of this NOFA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Curable technical deficiencies relate only to items that would not improve the substantive quality of the application,
relative to the ranking factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. If Forms HUD 52822 (Application) or HUD 52825 (Budget) are missing, the PHA's application will be considered substantively
incomplete, and therefore ineligible for further processing. However, if other forms [for example, Form HUD 50070
(Drug Free Workplace Certification), Form HUD 50071 (Certification for Contracts, Grants, Loans and Cooperative
Agreements), Form SF LLL (Disclosure of Lobbying Activities), if applicable, or Form HUD 2880 (Application/ Recipient
Disclosure/Update Report)] are missing, or if there is a technical mistake, such as no signature or the wrong signature
on a submitted form, the PHA will be given an opportunity to correct the deficiency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The responsibility for submitting a complete application rests with the PHA. Failure of the Field Office to identify
and provide a notice of deficiency to the PHA shall not relieve the PHA of the consequences of submitting an incomplete
application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. An application that does not meet all of the NOFA requirements after the 14-day technical deficiency period will
be removed from processing and determined to be unapprovable. If the PHA fails to correct deficiencies or fails to
submit missing forms or certifications, or any certification is incomplete or not executed by the appropriate person(s),
or the PHA Narrative Statement fails to address each of the Section IV.E. technical review factors, and each of the
Section I.D. eligibility criteria and the Section I.E. restriction criteria, the application will not be examined
for threshold approvability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Application Threshold Approvability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
After initial screening and upon expiration of the deficiency ``cure'' period, applications for which all the information,
certifications, and documentation required by the NOFA have been received by HUD will be examined for threshold approvability.
Applications that fail one or more of the threshold criteria will be removed from processing and determined to be unapprovable.
Applications which successfully pass the threshold review (threshold-approvable applications) will, following
Joint Review, be submitted by the Field Office to a panel(s) which will rate applications, using the criteria set out
in Section IV.E. of this NOFA. All applications must meet the following thresholds to be determined threshold-approvable:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. The MROP activities application must meet the eligibility criteria of Section I.D. and the restriction criteria
of Section I.E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The PHA may not have any litigation pending which would preclude approval of the application. The PHA must have the
required local cooperation and be legally eligible to develop, own, and operate public housing under the U.S. Housing
Act of 1937 and the application must have a properly executed and complete PHA Resolution (Form HUD 52471) referring
to the need for front-end funding, if requested, and a Local Governing Body Resolution (HUD 52472) which approves
the request for front-end funds, if front-end funds are requested. (NOTE: The PHA Resolution certifies to the PHA's
intent to comply with all requirements imposed by the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition
Policies Act of 1970 (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601&hyph;4655); the accessibility requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 8; and section 3 of the Housing and Urban
Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u), and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 135. By executing the
PHA resolution, the PHA also certifies that it will comply with the accessibility requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12131), and its implementing regulation at 28 CFR part 35.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Field Office must determine that the PHA has or will have the capability (as defined by Section IV.E.(1)(c))
to complete the MROP reconstruction activities and manage the resulting housing. The Field Office shall determine
capability based upon the PHA's overall performance, which includes the PHA's total score under the Public Housing
Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) (see 24 CFR part 901), and the PHA's most recent fiscal audit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. A PHA shall not be determined to lack administrative or development capability simply because it has no recent experience
in developing or managing public/assisted housing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. No application shall be determined to be approvable if the PHA has failed to return excess advances received during
development or modernization, or amounts determined by HUD to constitute excess financing based on a HUD-approved
Actual Development Cost Certificate (ADCC) or Actual Modernization Cost Certificate (AMCC), unless HUD has approved
a pay-back plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. There are no environmental factors precluding the MROP activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The PHA must be in compliance with civil rights laws and equal opportunity requirements. A PHA will be considered
to be in compliance if (1) as a result of formal administrative proceedings, there are no outstanding findings of noncompliance
with civil rights laws unless the PHA is operating in compliance with a HUD-approved compliance agreement designed
to correct the area(s) of noncompliance; (2) there is no adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action
brought against it by a private individual, unless the applicant demonstrates that it is operating in compliance
with a court order designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance; (3) there is no deferral of Federal funding based
upon civil rights violations; (4) there is no pending civil rights suit brought against the PHA by the Department of
Justice; or (5) there is no unresolved charge of discrimination against the PHA issued by the Secretary under section
810(g) of the Fair Housing Act, as implemented by 24 CFR 103.400.

C. Joint Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the designation of projects requiring Joint Reviews, the Field Office will conduct a (either on-site
or off-site) Joint Review for each threshold-approvable MROP activities application as early as possible pursuant
to the interim rule for the revised CIAP program, published on March 15, 1993 (58 FR 13916). The purpose of the Joint
Review is to allow the Field Office to more thoroughly understand the goals of the proposed MROP so it can prepare written
comments summarizing the results of the Joint Review; in contrast to the CIAP procedures, the PHA's MROP application
shall not be modified as a result of the Joint Review in any way.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

D. Field Submissions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
For each threshold-approvable application, the following must be prepared and submitted by the Field Office to the
panel(s): 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Copy of each application, narrative description of the number of units and units by bedroom size, structure type(s),
cost area, funding required, metro/non-metro designation, results of the eligibility determinations made under
Section I.D. of this NOFA and the restriction determinations under Section I.E. of this NOFA, as well as the results
of the Joint Review pursuant to Section IV.C. of this NOFA; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Review sheet summarizing critical information about the project, including a brief description of proposed MROP
activities and their proposed cost including any management improvements and a statement of the determination made
as to the extent such improvements are necessary to maintain the physical improvements resulting from the proposed
MROP activities, the applicable total development cost limitation, a discussion of the relationship and approval
date of any demolition/disposition or conversion, and the feasibility of MROP activities compared to demolition/disposition.

V. MROP Activities Funding and Further Processing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Each MROP activities application selected for funding by Headquarters shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Have funds reserved in an amount of at least 70 percent of the development cost limitation for the area and: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. The reservation amount will be ``trended'' to preclude the need for amendment funds; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The trend will be calculated by multiplying the percent of development cost by 5.4 percent (1.054), rounded to the
nearest $50; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Be assigned a development project number and entered into the appropriate HUD data systems; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. During and after fund reservation, development procedures shall be followed (24 CFR part 941 and Handbook 7417.1
REV&hyph;1) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sealed bid procurement method with award to the lowest responsible bidder; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Competitive proposal method as permitted for modernization projects under Notice PIH 93&hyph;50 (HA), whereby
the PHA would execute a fixed price contract in which the contractor would be responsible for design of specific work
items identified in the Request for Proposals, soliciting and contracting for construction work, contract administration
and construction inspection; the contract could either provide for progress payments, as in the sealed bid method,
or a lump sum payment after successful completion of all work; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. CIAP modernization standards set forth in Handbook 7485.2 REV&hyph;1 must be used; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. The PHA must incorporate its approved MROP activities application into a PHA Proposal (Form HUD&hyph;52483A);

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. The special MROP Annual Contributions Contract (Form HUD&hyph;53010&hyph;I), included in Notice PIH 89&hyph;41(HUD),

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Environmental Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations
at 24 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 50, implementing section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The Finding
of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection and copying between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays at
the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Room 10276, Washington, D.C. 20410.

B. Federalism 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined
that this NOFA will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationship
with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of
government. The NOFA will provide PHAs with funding for public housing development MROP activities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official for Executive Order 12606, the Family, has determined that the provisions
of this NOFA do not have the potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance and general well-being
within the meaning of the Order. To the extent that the funding provided through this NOFA results in additional or
improved housing, the effects on the family will be beneficial.

D. Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities: The Byrd Amendment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of Federal contracts, grants,
or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government
in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants,
cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that
no Federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance. A certification
is required, at the time the application for funds is made, that Federally appropriated funds are not being or have
not been used in violation of section 319 and that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
disclosure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
will be made of payments for lobbying with other than Federally appropriated funds. Also, there is a standard disclosure
form, SF-LLL, ``Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying,'' which must be used to disclose lobbying with other than Federally
appropriated funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->
E. Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 103 of the HUD Reform Act proscribes the communication of certain information by HUD employees to persons
not authorized to receive that information during the selection process for the award of assistance. HUD's regulation
implementing section 103 is codified at 24 CFR part 4. That regulation applies to the funding competition announced
today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by 24 CFR
part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted by 24 CFR part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (voice/TDD). (This is
not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well.
However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed
with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters
Counsel for the program to which the question pertains.
