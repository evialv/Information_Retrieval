SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14739), the Board published a revision to its organization and functions statement to reflect
the realignment of its regional offices. Since that time, the Board completed its review of the organization and functions
of its headquarters offices and effected a reorganization of those offices in accordance with the recommendations
of the National Performance Review (NPR) and the President's Memorandum of September 11, 1993, titled ``Streamlining
the Bureaucracy.'' The reorganization eliminates excessive layers of management review and control, consolidates
functions, and improves the ratio of supervisors and managers to other employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following organizational changes have been made in the Board's headquarters offices: (1) The office of the Executive
Director has been abolished; (2) the offices of Inspector General and Management Analysis have been abolished and
their functions distributed to other offices; (3) the offices of Administrative Law Judge and Regional Operations
have been combined; and (4) the office of Administration has been assigned additional functions and retitled the
office of Planning and Resource Management Services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is amending the titles of &sect;&sect;1200.1, 1200.2, and 1200.10 of this part to conform them to the format
of the new &sect;1200.3 of this part added effective August 5, 1994 (59 FR 39937) and the other parts of the Board's regulations
(5 CFR parts 1201 through 1210). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board is publishing this rule as a final rule pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &sect;1204(h).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Merit Systems Protection Board is amending its rules at 5 CFR part 1201 to add a new appealable action and to correct
the citations for two others in &sect;1201.3(a); to delete &sect;1201.3(d); to clarify the place of filing requirements
in &sect;&sect;1201.4(d), 1201.22(a), and 1201.182 following the realignment of the Board's regional and field
offices; to correct a cross-reference in &sect;1201.37(a); to conform the method of filing requirements for original
jurisdiction cases in &sect;1201.122(c) to those for appellate jurisdiction cases; to replace the July 1991 edition
of the MSPB Appeal Form in Appendix I with the revised October 1994 edition; to add information regarding the TDD (Telecommunications
Device for the Deaf) capability of facsimile numbers in the regional and field offices, add the suite number of the
Atlanta Regional Office, and change the address and facsimile number of the Denver Field Office in Appendix II; and
to add and delete approved hearing locations in Appendix III.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Section 1201.3(a)(6) is amended by adding 5 CFR part 844 to the citation so that the citation refers to the part of
the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management governing disability retirement determinations under the
Federal Employees' Retirement System, as well as to 5 CFR parts 831 and 842.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Section 1201.3(a)(7) is amended by correcting the citation to read ``5 CFR 731.103(d) and 731.508.'' The corrected
citation refers to the regulations of the Office of Personnel Management providing for appeals to the Board of suitability
determinations made by an agency acting under authority delegated by OPM (5 CFR 731.103(d)) and such determinations
made by OPM (5 CFR 731.508).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Section 1201.3(a) is amended by adding a new subparagraph (21) to include as an action appealable to the Board a
reduction-in-force action affecting a career or career candidate appointee in the Foreign Service. Public Law 103&hyph;326,
effective April 30, 1994, amended the Foreign Service Act of 1980 (22 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.) by, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 providing authority to the Secretary of State to conduct reductions in force affecting career or career candidate
appointees in the Foreign Service and by granting those appointees the right to appeal such reduction-in-force actions
to the Board.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Section 1201.3 is amended by deleting paragraph (d). This paragraph was added to the Board's rules in this part
to implement 5 U.S.C. 1221(j), as added by the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;12). Subsequently,
the Board ruled in

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 57 M.S.P.R. 288 (1993) that 5 U.S.C. 1221(j) and the Board's regulation at 5 CFR 1201.3(d) should be construed to apply
only to individual right of action appeals and other actions established by 5 U.S.C. chapter 12. Because the provisions
of part 1201 are applicable to appeals that arise from actions other than those established by 5 U.S.C. chapter 12,
the Board has determined that the continued inclusion of &sect;1201.3(d) in this part is likely to prove confusing
to parties and that it should, therefore, be deleted.

(e) Section 1201.4(d) is amended to clarify the definition of ``appropriate'' office for purposes of filings with
the Board. On March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14739), the Board published a revision to its rules in appendix II and appendix III
of this part to reflect the realignment of its regional office structure into six regional and five field offices.
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 explaining that revision, the Board stated in part: ``Appeals and related matters will continue to be filed with either
the regional or field office having geographic jurisdiction.'' The Board is now amending &sect;1201.4(d) to specifically
include field offices, as well as regional offices, in the definition.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Section 1201.22(a) is amended to clarify that appeals and responses to appeals are to be filed with the appropriate
Board regional or field office. See explanation in paragraph (e) above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Section 1201.37(a) is amended by deleting the reference to ``&sect;1201.116'' and replacing it with ``&sect;1201.117.''
On June 16, 1994 (59 FR 30863), the Board published an amendment to its rules in this part that revised &sect;1201.115,
redesignated &sect;&sect;1201.116 through 1201.119 as &sect;&sect;1201.117 through 1201.120, respectively,
and added a new &sect;1201.116. Because the former &sect;1201.116 was redesignated as &sect;1201.117, the Board
is now making a conforming amendment to the cross-reference to that section in &sect;1201.37(a).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Section 1201.122(c) is amended by adding ``commercial overnight delivery'' as a method of filing and service.
On July 7, 1993 (58 FR 36345), the Board amended its rules in subparts B and C of this part to permit filing and service
of appeals and petitions for review by commercial overnight delivery. The Board is now amending &sect;1201.122(c)
to conform the method of filing and service requirements for Special Counsel complaints and proposed agency actions
against administrative law judges in subpart D of this part to those for appeals and petitions for review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Section 1201.163(c)(1) is amended to clarify that mixed case appeals governed by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of
1978 are to be filed with the appropriate Board regional or field office. See explanation in paragraph (e) above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j) Section 1201.182(a) and &sect;1201.182(c) are amended to clarify that petitions for enforcement of orders issued
under the Board's appellate jurisdiction are to be filed with the appropriate Board regional or field office. See
explanation in paragraph (e) above.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

or field office having geographic jurisdiction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

appeals made by the Board's amendment to its rules in this part on June 17, 1994 (59 FR 31109).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) On page 1, both ``WHEN TO FILE AN APPEAL'' and ``HOW TO FILE AN APPEAL'' have been revised to include ``commercial
overnight delivery'' as a method of filing an appeal, in accordance with the Board's amendment to its rules in this

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) On page 1, the final sentence under ``Public Reporting Burden'' has been revised to replace ``Office of Management
Analysis'' with ``Office of Planning and Resource Management Services'' to reflect the reorganization of the Board's
headquarters offices and, at the request of the Office of Management and Budget, to delete the requirement that comments
and suggestions be sent to OMB's Paperwork Reduction Project.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) On page 2, a sentence has been added in block 7 to put the appellant on notice that designating a representative in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) On page 2, a check-off box for ``Foreign Service'' has been added in block 20 because career and career candidate
appointees in the Foreign Service now have the right to appeal reduction-in-force actions to the Board. See explanation

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) On page 4, in block 38, the phrase ``full 30-day notice'' has been replaced with ``the required number of days notice''
to reflect changes in statute and Office of Personnel Management regulations that now require at least 60 days advance
notice for most reduction-in-force actions, with provision for a longer notice period_at least 120 days_for some
Department of Defense actions, and shorter notice_less than 60 days but at least 30 days_under certain circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10) On page 6, in block 41.a, the material after ``Yes'' has been revised to clarify that the attachment requested

Management Division; see notice published September 15, 1994 (59 FR 47363), corrected October 18, 1994 (59 FR 52558).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Appendix II is amended by adding information regarding the TDD (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf) capability
of facsimile numbers in the regional and field offices, by substituting the suite number for ``10th Floor'' in the
address of the Atlanta Regional Office, and by changing the address and facsimile number of the Denver Field Office
to reflect the relocation of that office effective December 1, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(m) Appendix III is amended by adding two approved hearing locations and deleting one under the Atlanta Regional Office,
by adding two under the Denver Field Office, by adding one under the New York Field Office, and by adding one under the

Pleadings may be served on parties by mail, by personal delivery, by facsimile, or by commercial overnight delivery.
Service by mail is accomplished by mailing the pleading to each party or representative, at the party's or representative's
last known address. Service by facsimile is accomplished by transmitting the pleading by facsimile to each party
or representative. Service by personal delivery or by commercial overnight delivery is accomplished by delivering
the pleading to the business office or home of each party or representative and leaving it with the party or representative,
or with a responsible person at that address. Regardless of the method of service, the party serving the document must
submit to the Board, along with the pleading, a certificate of service as proof that the document was served on the other
parties or their representatives. The certificate of service must list the names and addresses of the persons on whom
the pleading was served, must state the date on which the pleading was served, must state the method (i.e., mail, personal
delivery, facsimile, or commercial overnight delivery) by which service was accomplished, and must be signed by
the person responsible for accomplishing service.

 On March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14739), the Board published a revision to its rules at 5 CFR part 1201, appendix II and appendix
III, to reflect the realignment of its regional office structure into six regional and five field offices. In the ``SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION'' explaining that revision, the Board stated in part: ``Appeals and related matters will continue to
be filed with either the regional or field office having geographic jurisdiction.'' The Board is now amending its
rules at 5 CFR part 1209 by adding ``or field'' after ``regional'' in &sect;&sect;1209.8, 1209.9, and 1209.10 to clarify
the place of filing requirement for stay requests of personnel actions allegedly based on whistleblowing.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In August 1991, the Board of Governors adopted the Uniform Rules of Practice and Procedure (Rules) (56 FR 38048, Aug.
9, 1991). The Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of Thrift
Supervision (OTS) and National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) have also adopted the Rules (OCC, 56 FR 38024,
Aug. 9, 1991; FDIC, 56 FR 37968, Aug. 9, 1991; OTS, 56 FR 38302, Aug. 12, 1991; and NCUA, 56 FR 37762, Aug. 8, 1991). The
Board of Governors is amending one aspect of the Rules relating to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications to clarify that the Rules parallel the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. The other
agencies have proposed or are considering proposing a similar amendment (FDIC, 59 FR 60921, Nov. 29, 1994; OTS, 59
FR 62354, Dec. 5, 1994). The Board of Governors issued this amendment as a proposed rule on November 22, 1994 (59 FR 60094,
Nov. 22, 1994). It is now adopting the rule in the form proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, &sect;263.9 of the Rules prohibits ``a party, his or her counsel, or another interested person'' from
making an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
communication to the Board or other decisional official concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding. When
the Rules were proposed and adopted in 1991, the joint notice of proposed rulemaking (56 FR 27790, 27793, June 17, 1991)
explained that the proposed rule regarding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications ``adopts the rules and procedures set forth in the APA regarding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications.'' There was no intention at that time to impose a rule more restrictive than that imposed by the APA
itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The APA contains two provisions relating to communications with agency decision-makers. The APA's 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communication provision restricts communications between ``interested person[s] 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
outside the agency
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' and the agency head, the administrative law judge (ALJ), or the agency decisional employees. 5 U.S.C. 557(d) (emphasis
added). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Intra-agency
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications are governed by the APA's separation of functions provision, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). That section prohibits
investigative or prosecutorial personnel at an agency from ``participat[ing] or advis[ing] in the decision, recommended
decision, or agency review'' of an adjudicatory matter pursuant to section 557 of the APA except as witness or counsel.
The same separation of function provision provides that the ALJ in an adjudicatory matter may not consult any party
on a fact in issue unless the other parties have an opportunity to participate. 5 U.S.C. 554(d)(1). The separation
of functions provision does not prohibit agency investigatory or prosecutorial staff from seeking the amendment
of a notice or the settlement or termination of a proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule as proposed and adopted in 1991, however, did not mention the separation of functions concept explicitly,
and appeared to apply the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communication prohibition to all communications concerning the merits of an adjudicatory proceeding between the
agency head, ALJ or decisional personnel on the one hand, and any ``party, his or her counsel, or another person interested
in the proceeding'' on the other. The Board of Governors does not interpret this provision as limiting agency enforcement
staff's ability to seek approval of amendments to or terminations of existing enforcement actions. As drafted, however,
the provision could be misinterpreted to expand the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communication prohibition beyond the scope of the APA. The Board of Governors did not intend this result.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The amendment clarifies that the regulation is intended to conform to the provisions of the APA by limiting the prohibition
on 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communications to communications to or from ``interested persons outside the agency,'' 5 U.S.C. 557(d), and by incorporating
explicitly the APA's separation of functions provisions, 5 U.S.C. 554(d). This approach is also consistent with
the most recent Model Adjudication Rules prepared by the Administrative Conference of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board of Governors received two comments on the proposed rule, both of which supported it. One of the commenters
suggested that the Board explain the so-called ``Chinese wall'' that prevents those staff members involved in the
prosecutorial function from communicating with those who advise the Board on a particular matter. The amended rule
specifically sets out the APA's separation of function provision, which prohibits agency prosecutorial personnel
in one case from participating in the Board's decision on that or a factually related case. This provision clearly
prevents prosecutorial staff from communicating about the merits of a case with those staff members who advise the
Board regarding a final decision in the case. It is unnecessary to set out internal procedures implementing this statutory
prohibition in a formal rulemaking, and to do so could limit the Board's flexibility with respect to internal organization.

II. Regulatory Flexibility Act

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Board of Governors hereby certifies that the final
rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory
flexibility analysis is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule makes a minor amendment to a rule of practice already in place, and affects intra-agency procedure exclusively.
Thus, it should not result in additional burden for regulated institutions. The purpose of the revised regulation
is to conform the provisions of the regulation to those imposed by statute.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc Spey series turbofan engines,
that requires a one-time inspection of stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT)
disks for cracks and corrosion pitting. This amendment is prompted by a report of a stage 7 high pressure compressor
disk found cracked due to corrosion. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an HPT or LPT disk burst
due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to Rolls-Royce, plc (R-R) Spey series turbofan engines was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on January 11, 1994 (59 FR 1500). That action proposed to require a one-time inspection of stage 1 and stage 2 high pressure
turbine (HPT) and low pressure turbine (LPT) disks for cracks and corrosion pitting once the disks have completed
at least 40% of their published Group ``A'' cyclic life limits as specified in the applicable overhaul manual. These
disks must be inspected in accordance with the applicable overhaul manual during the engine's next shop visit where
either the HPT or LPT disks are removed after the effective date of this AD. Accomplishment of this inspection will
allow stage 1 and stage 2 HPT and LPT disks to complete the remainder of their current published cyclic life limits.
The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with R-R Service Bulletin No. Sp72&hyph;1044, dated
September 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the one comment received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter concurs with the AD as proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the definition of shop visit has been clarified to eliminate the reference to next scheduled disk inspection
and include next disk removal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes described previously. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD and that the average
labor rate is $55 per work hour. The FAA estimates that it will take no additional work hours per engine to accomplish
the required actions to the HPT's as the inspection is performed during regular turbine overhauls. Approximately
80% of the engines will require an additional 25 work hours of extra access, inspection, and rebuild time to perform
the required LPT inspection. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated
to be $189,750. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974, Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) is adopting a change to exempt a new system
of records, HDNA 011, entitled Inspector General Investigation Files, from certain provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a.
The exemption is intended to increase the value of the system of records for law enforcement purposes, to comply with
prohibitions against the disclosure of certain kinds of information, and to protect the privacy of individuals identified
in the system of records.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined that this Privacy
Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action.' Analysis of the rule
indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious inconsistency
or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter the budgetary
impact of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the right and obligations of recipients thereof; does
not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993).

The DNA Inspector General's Office performs as one of its principal functions under the Inspector General Act of 1978,
as amended by the Inspector General Act Amendment of 1988 (Pub. L. 95&hyph;452, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.3) (IG Act),
investigations into and enforcement actions concerned with suspected violations. The DNA OIG is responsible for
promoting economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of DNA programs and operations and to detect
and prevent fraud, waste and abuse in such programs and operations.

The (k)(2) exemption reflects recognition that certain records in the system may be deemed to require protection
from disclosure in order to protect confidential sources mentioned in the files and avoid compromising, impeding,
or interfering with investigative and enforcement proceedings. The system would thus be exempt from sections 5 U.S.C.
552a(c)(3); (d)(1) through (d)(4); (e)(1); (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I); and (f). The proposed rule was published on August
15, 1994, at 59 FR 41739. No comments were received, therefore, the DNA is adopting the changes.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reasons. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From subsection (c)(3) because it will enable DNA to conduct certain investigations and relay law enforcement information
without compromise of the information, protection of investigative techniques and efforts employed, and identities
of confidential sources who might not otherwise come forward and who furnished information under an express promise
that the sources' identity would be held in confidence (or prior to the effective date of the Act, under an implied promise.)
From subsection (d)(1) through (d)(4) and (f) because providing access to records of a civil investigation and the
right to contest the contents of those records and force changes to be made to the information contained therein would
seriously interfere with and thwart the orderly and unbiased conduct of the investigation and impede case preparation.
Providing access rights normally afforded under the Privacy Act would provide the subject with valuable information
that would allow interference with or compromise of witnesses or render witnesses reluctant to cooperate; lead to
suppression, alteration, or destruction of evidence; and result in the secreting of or other disposition of assets
that would make them difficult or impossible to reach in order to satisfy any Government claim growing out of the investigation
or proceeding. From subsection (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I) because it will provide protection against notification
of investigatory material including certain reciprocal investigations and counterintelligence information,
which might alert a subject to the fact that an investigation of that individual is taking place, and the disclosure
of which would weaken the on-going investigation, reveal investigatory techniques, and place confidential informants
in jeopardy who furnished information under an express promise that the sources' identity would be held in confidence
(or prior to the effective date of the Act, under an implied promise).

 EPA is revoking a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) for the chemical substance described generically as an alkenyl ether of alkanetriol polymer, which was
the subject of premanufacture notice (PMN) P&hyph;93&hyph;458. EPA initially published this SNUR using direct
final rulemaking procedures. EPA received adverse comments on this rule. Therefore, the Agency is revoking this
rule, as required under the Expedited SNUR rulemaking process (40 CFR part 721 subpart D). In a separate notice of proposed
rulemaking published elsewhere in today's issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51672), EPA issued several direct final SNURs including a SNUR for the substance described
generically as alkenyl ether of alkanetriol polymer, PMN P&hyph;93&hyph;458. As described in 40 CFR 721.160, EPA
is revoking the rule issued for P&hyph;93&hyph;458 under direct final rulemaking procedures because the Agency
received adverse comments. As required by &sect;721.160(a)(3)(iii), EPA is proposing the rule published elsewhere

to 40 CFR part 721 subpart D. The record for the direct final SNUR for this substance which is being revoked by this rule
was established at OPPTS&hyph;50612. That record includes information considered by the Agency in developing this
rule, and includes the adverse comments to which the Agency has responded with this revocation. The docket control
number for the revocation is OPPTS&hyph;50612C. For details, refer to the proposal published elsewhere in today's

 EPA is revoking a significant new use rule (SNUR) promulgated under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control
Act (TSCA) for the chemical substance described generically as polyalkylene polyamine which was the subject of premanufacture
notice (PMN) P&hyph;89&hyph;963. EPA initially published this SNUR using direct final rulemaking procedures.
EPA received adverse comments on this rule. Therefore, the Agency is revoking this rule, as required under the Expedited
SNUR rulemaking process (40 CFR part 721 subpart D). In a separate notice of proposed rulemaking published elsewhere
in today's issue of the

 This rule amends part 1607 of the Legal Services Corporation's (``LSC'' or ``Corporation'') regulations relating
to governing bodies of recipients of LSC funds. Many of the revisions are simply intended to clarify current Corporation
policy or to interrelate this part to other LSC regulations. However, a number of the revisions represent changes
in Corporation policy or interpretations with respect to issues that arise under the regulation. The final rule also
includes a number of technical revisions to make the rule easier to understand and apply.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Operations and Regulations Committee (``Committee'') of the LSC Board of Directors (``Board'') held public
hearings on April 15, 1994, in Washington, DC, and on May 13, 1994, in Atlanta, Georgia, to consider drafts of proposed
revisions to 45 CFR part 1607, LSC's regulation on recipient governing bodies. At the meeting in Atlanta, the Committee
approved a draft, which was published as a proposed rule for public comment at 59 FR 30885 (June 16, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twenty-two written comments were received and reviewed by the Corporation. The comments generally applauded the
proposed revisions, but there were some areas of disagreement and several suggestions for changes. On September
16 and 30, 1994, the Committee held public meetings to consider the written and oral comments on the proposed rule.
Based on those comments, the Committee made several revisions. The Committee met again on October 27, 1994, and voted
to recommend a final rule for adoption by the full Board. On November 5, 1994, the Board voted to adopt the rule as recommended
by the Committee for publication as a final rule in the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Corporation recognizes that legislation to amend the Legal Services Corporation Act and reauthorize appropriations
for the Corporation may be considered by Congress. If such legislation does become law, the Corporation's regulations
will be revisited and revised accordingly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to amending 45 CFR part 1607, this rule is also intended to supersede part 1607's interpretive guideline
published at 48 FR 36820 (August 15, 1983). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 1607.2&blank;Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Most of the changes in this section are technical and clarifying in nature. The section has been reordered to put the
definitions in alphabetical order. Also, definitions found in other parts of the regulations but applicable to this
part are included here for easier reference. In addition, language found in other sections of this part that, in fact,
constitute definitions of terms are included here both for easier reference and to treat similar terms similarly.
A new definition was added and some of the language has been clarified to make it consistent with past and current LSC
interpretations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1607.2(a)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the definition of ``attorney member'' applies to attorneys who serve on any recipient board subject to this
part, it was added primarily to make it clear that board members of a national support center do not have to be admitted
to practice in a state where the center actually provides legal assistance. Because the ``service area'' of national
support centers is the entire nation, an attorney board member need be admitted to practice in only one of the 50 states.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested that law professors who teach within a recipient's service area, but who are not members of the
bar in the recipient's service area, should be allowed to serve as an ``attorney member'' on the recipient's board.
Statutory requirements for recipient boards do not allow this option. However, such law professors may serve pursuant
to &sect;1607.3(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1607.2(c)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of ``eligible client member'' has been revised from the current definition. First, the language has
been changed to make it clear that client board members must be eligible at the time of their appointment to each term
of office. Thus, a client member who is financially eligible for services when first appointed to a recipient's board
may not be reappointed to a second or subsequent term if, at the time of reappointment, the client board member is no
longer financially eligible for LSC-funded services. However, nothing in the rule would require a client board member
to resign during the course of a term if the client became ineligible subsequent to appointment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments suggested a further change to the definition to clarify that eligibility is based on financial eligibility,
so that individuals who would be financially eligible to receive legal assistance, but who could not be served by the
recipient because of some other restriction on types of legal assistance or program priorities, could serve on recipient
boards. The Board agreed and revised the language to clarify that a member need only be financially eligible pursuant
to the requirements of LSC's financial eligibility guidelines, set out in 45 CFR part 1611, to qualify for board membership.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Language has also been adopted for this definition to clarify, in response to concerns raised in comments, that it
is the national rather than the local financial eligibility standard that is applicable. As long as a person would
qualify for services under Part 1611, the person would qualify for board membership, regardless of whether the recipient
has a lower financial eligibility threshold or regardless of whether the person would also qualify for other services
provided by the recipient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some comments suggested that the definition should be expanded to include individuals who are eligible for non-LSC-funded
but not LSC-funded services provided by the recipient. One such comment suggested the adoption of a proportionality
requirement, so that clients who are eligible for non-LSC-funded services, but not LSC-funded services, could serve
in proportion to the amount of overall funding from the non-LSC source. Several comments argued that it is more important
that client representatives be effective advocates for clients than that they be financially eligible for LSC-funded
services. Two comments suggested substantially different and more expansive definitions of eligibility for client
board membership. After consideration of these proposals, the Board decided not to expand the definition because
it wished to insure that the focus of the legal services program remains on the indigent population. The Board believes
that eligible client members are supposed to bring to the recipient a perspective of the community's needs, and that
can best be done by someone who is financially eligible for the recipient's LSC-funded services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The last major change to the definition is intended to clarify that it is the recipient that should decide how client
board member eligibility is determined, i.e., the recipient should decide whether it or a particular group should
make the determination. Thus, the recipient could decide that, for some groups, the recipient will make the determination
and for others it will leave the determination up to the appointing group. Two comments opposed the language that permits
client eligibility determinations to be made by the appointing groups, rather than the recipient, arguing that the
determination should not be delegated. No changes were made to the proposal, however, because it does not require
that the recipient delegate the decision; it merely gives the recipient the choice.

Section 1607.2(d)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule defined ``governing body'' so that it would have applied both to the governing bodies of recipients
who have as a primary purpose the provision of legal assistance to eligible clients and to the policy boards or bodies
established pursuant to the waiver provision in &sect;1607.6(d). However, in response to comments on the proposed
definition, the Board narrowed the definition so that it does not apply to the policy boards or bodies referred to in
&sect;1607.6(d). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There was a concern expressed in a comment as to whether a body that does not have full authority to make all ``governing''
policy and administrative decisions for the LSC-funded project would fall within the rule's definition of ``governing
body.'' For example, one LSC recipient that receives very little of its funding from LSC has set up a ``policy board''
to oversee the LSC grant separate from its Board of Directors, which oversees all of its other activities. However,
the policy board does not have all the authority envisioned by this rule in the definition of ``governing body'' and
in &sect;1607.4, which deals with the functions of governing bodies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response, the Board decided to define ``governing body'' so that it does not apply to the policy boards or bodies
referred to in &sect;1607.6(d) and to make it clear that a governing body should have full authority over LSC grants
as envisioned in this rule. However, in certain special circumstances that are discussed at length in this commentary
on &sect;1607.6 on waivers, the President has the authority to grant waivers on board composition requirements.
As a condition of granting such a waiver, a recipient would be required to establish a special policy board or body,
rather than a governing board or body, to oversee the grant.

Section 1607.2(e)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A definition of ``policy body'' is added to this section to distinguish such a body from a governing body. As discussed

However, a policy body would be required to conform to the membership and appointment requirements of &sect;1607.3,
as well as the meeting requirements and compensation restriction in &sect;&sect;1607.4 and 1607.5, respectively,
and would be required to have full authority to set policy for the services and activities funded under the LSC grant.

This section is revised to require in paragraph (a) that all board members must be supportive of the purposes of the
LSC Act, and must be interested in and knowledgeable about the delivery of quality legal services to the poor. The current
regulation does not include any similar requirement for client board members, but does include similar, although
not identical, requirements for attorney and other board members. The rule removes the reference to the board's reflecting
``the characteristics'' of the client community, in part because it is not clear what that language means and in part
because it could be construed to be inconsistent with diversity requirements that are included in this section for
each category of board membership.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three diversity provisions are added to the regulation in &sect;&sect;1607.3(b)(3), (c) and (d) to require that
board members reflect the diversity of the legal and client communities, including such factors as race, ethnicity,
gender, and other similar factors. In so doing, the regulation relocates the current section of the rule that relates
to diversity among attorney board members, revises the language to incorporate a more up-to-date statement of the
concerns addressed by the current subsection, and applies the requirement to all categories of board members. While
the language of this final rule specifically mentions race, ethnicity, and gender, it also includes a reference to
``other similar factors'' that may be relevant in a particular legal community and population of the area served by
the recipient, which may include, for example, age, physical abilities, and religious belief. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule did not have the word ``similar'' as a modifier in the phrase ``other factors.'' Some comments stated
that the diversity requirement was too broad and compliance would be difficult if, at the same time, a recipient did
not have the authority to select client board members. However, other comments suggested broader areas of diversity,
such as experience or expertise in poverty areas, such as housing, education, benefits, homelessness, etc. The Board
decided to revise the language to ``other similar factors'' instead of ``other factors.'' This revision is intended
to provide sufficient leeway for local programs to determine the appropriate types of diversity in their service
areas and to insure that their local boards ``reasonably'' reflect those types of diversity that are relevant to the
mission of legal services programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The provision does not require mathematical precision, but sets out goals that recipients should strive to achieve.
In this regard, &sect;1607.3(h) will allow programs to consult with the appointing organizations to insure that
the appointments are made consistent with LSC guidelines. This seems to be a reasonable compromise between allowing
no recipient input and giving the recipient the authority to make all appointments. Finally, if necessary and appropriate,
the waiver provision in &sect;1607.6 could be utilized.

With respect to attorney board members, the rule revises the language of the current rule that is based on the requirements
of the McCollum Amendment in the act appropriating funds for the Corporation. The McCollum Amendment requires a majority
of the board members to be appointed by appropriate state, county and municipal bar associations. The revision clarifies
that the appointments can be made by one or more such bar associations, as long as those bar associations collectively
represent a majority of attorneys practicing law in the recipient's service area. If there are minority or gender-based
bar associations that represent attorneys practicing in a particular locality, those bar associations may be included
in the mix of bar associations that make appointments of attorneys to a recipient's board, especially if their inclusion
would help to insure that there is appropriate diversity among the attorney members of the board. In addition, although
the rule, consistent with the language of the McCollum Amendment, states that the appointments are to be made by the
``governing bodies'' of the bar associations, the Board recognizes that different bar associations should be free
to exercise their appointment responsibility in a manner consistent with their own policies, procedures and practices.
The McCollum Amendment does not direct LSC to impose any particular method of appointment on a bar association. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment objected to term limitations on attorney appointments imposed by a state bar and suggested that the rule
state specifically that any decisions on term limitations should be made by the recipient as part of its bylaws, rather
than by the appointing bar or other organization. The Board did not incorporate the suggested change, because it feels
that recipients should be allowed to work out those differences on a local level with the appointing organizations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule also adds language which is based on part of the McCollum Amendment to make it clear that national support centers
are not required to use the American Bar Association (``ABA'') or a collection of all state bars to appoint their attorney
members, simply because they provide service nationally. The rule also recognizes that some recipients, especially
Native American or migrant programs, may have offices in one state, but also provide services in one or more adjacent
or nearby states. The language is intended to permit those programs, if they so decide, to have the bar associations
of the other states in which they provide service make appointments as well as the bar of the state in which their principal
office is located. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the additional ten percent of the board members who must be attorneys, but who are not covered by the McCollum Amendment,
the final rule now explicitly states what is implicit in the language of the current regulation, i.e., that they may
be selected by the recipient's governing body, if it so chooses. The rule does change the current regulation with respect
to the additional ten percent of attorney board members in one respect, however. Under the current regulation, the
additional attorneys must be representatives of bar associations or other legal organizations, e.g., law schools.
This requirement is not contained in the LSC Act. Under this revised regulation, the recipient may select attorneys
who are not representatives of any particular bar or legal organization, or may select attorneys who are affiliated
with non-legal organizations, as long as they are admitted to practice in a state within the recipient's service area,
and as long as the organization has an interest in the delivery of legal services to the poor. Thus, the recipient may
select lawyers who represent the business community or the United Way and who could be helpful in fundraising, or lawyers
who provide substantial pro bono services to the client community and could be helpful in designing a recipient's
private attorney involvement program.

Section 1607.3(c)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule includes a number of changes in the language that relates to client board members. The principal revision
addresses the ambiguity of the language of the current regulation that has caused problems for some LSC recipients.
This revision codifies the current LSC interpretation of the language to require that client board members be selected
by client groups that have been designated by the recipient. The revision also adds language that more accurately
reflects the kind of groups or organizations that would be appropriate client groups for purposes of selecting eligible
client members. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Most comments applauded the language broadening the types of client organizations that may make appointments. Comments
were not uniform, however, on whether recipients or client groups should have authority to appoint client board members.
Numerous comments supported the clarification and the policy choice that it represented, while other comments stated
that it is very difficult, and sometimes impossible, to comply with the requirement that client members be appointed
by client organizations. According to these comments, often there are no organized client groups within the service
area and, even when there are, it is not necessarily true that client groups speak for the client community. Other comments
noted that recipients often come into contact with program clients or other financially eligible individuals who
would make good client board members but who, for one reason or another, are not involved with any client group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No change was made by the Board in response to comments on the proposed language. With the addition of &sect;1607.3(h),
permitting consultation with the appointing organizations, and the waiver provisions in &sect;1607.6, the rule
attempts to strike a reasonable balance among these concerns by (1) giving local programs as much input as possible
into the selection of board members and (2) providing for waivers for special conditions.

With respect to the other board members, i.e., those that are neither attorney members nor eligible client members,
the rule makes it clear that recipient boards are permitted to fill these slots. This gives recipients flexibility
to include board members who can help them with fundraising, community relations, coordination with other social
service providers, or any other locally identified need. Law school professors who cannot count as ``attorney members''
because they are not admitted to practice in a state within the recipient's service area, could be selected for this
category of membership. Although there is no comparable language in the current regulation, this provision is consistent
with longstanding LSC interpretations.

This provision is revised by adding language to the ``domination'' provision in the current regulation to make it
clear that the provision is not intended to prevent recipients from designating a single regional or statewide client
council as the appointing organization for client board members, as long as that client council represents numerous
smaller client groups. One comment suggested that coalitions may not always be broad-based and that there might be
competing coalitions of client groups within a service area. The regulation, however, does not require that recipients
use coalitions as the appointing organizations; it merely gives recipients the choice.

Section 1607.3(g)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section establishes a standard for dealing with recipient board vacancies by requiring recipients to make reasonable
and good faith efforts to insure that governing body vacancies are filled promptly. Implicit in this standard is a
recognition that recipients often have no control over the appointment process other than to change the groups that
they have designated to make the appointments if a particular group fails to make an appointment in a timely manner.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments generally favored this provision. One comment noted that the existence of a few vacancies on a large board
would have no influence on the ability of a recipient to conduct its business. Several cautioned, however, that recipients
``should be expected to exercise due diligence in the filling of board vacancies'' and others proposed specific timeframes
for compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Corporation retained the proposed language as a reasonable and realistic approach to problems with vacancies;
but the Corporation also recognizes that there are alternative approaches to deal with vacancies. For example, through
their own bylaws or board policies, recipients could take a number of actions when appointing organizations are slow
in making appointments, refuse to make them, or are unable to make them for whatever reason. Thus, a recipient board
could adopt bylaws that would permit its members to hold over until replacements are appointed, or could allow for
short-term interim appointments, if necessary, until regular appointments could be made.

Section 1607.3(h)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section has been revised from the proposed rule. It incorporates and amends the consultation provisions in the
proposed &sect;1607.3(f) and the provisions in the proposed &sect;1607.3(h) that would have explicitly permitted
a recipient to veto an appointee to its board. As adopted by the Board, this paragraph now states affirmatively that
recipients may recommend names to bar associations and other appointing groups and should consult with those groups
to insure that appropriate appointments are made. The Board adopted this consultation provision because it recognizes
that bar associations or other groups may wish to request information from recipients on who would make a good legal
services program board member and that appointing groups would benefit from recipient input in making their appointments.
Most comments, including those from several bar associations, approved of this proposal, as long as it is clear that
appointing bodies are to make independent judgments about whom to appoint to recipient boards. It is the intent of
the Board that appointing organizations are to make independent judgments and retain their status as the decision
makers for recipient board members. The consultation provision is meant to be an aid, not an impediment, to the appointing
organization's decision making process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of comments from the Standing Committee on Legal Aid and Indigent Defendants (``SCLAID'') of the American
Bar Association, the Board chose not to adopt the provision authorizing a recipient to veto an appointee. SCLAID opposed
the provision because it could cause unnecessary controversy and has the potential to be misread or misunderstood.
SCLAID suggested that the consultation provision would obviate most problems at the outset and that local recipient
bylaw provisions or state laws would adequately resolve any problems that might arise. Although other bar associations
approved the concept of the veto provision, they advised building more specific checks and balances into the provision,
for safeguards. The Board agreed that there were problems with the veto provision and decided to incorporate the consideration
of individual or institutional conflict into the consultation provision. In addition, the Board noted that applicable
state law that deals with conflict issues of nonprofit boards and recipient bylaws should be consulted to determine
what mechanisms are available to deal with situations that cannot be resolved through the consultation process.
Accordingly, recipients could amend their bylaws to add provisions that deal with board membership conflicts as
long as the bylaws do not conflict with any requirements of the LSC Act or regulations. Then, when making recommendations
to appointing organizations, recipients may refer to their bylaws as part of the standards by which board members
should be appointed. It is recommended that such bylaws deal with situations where conflict issues are not resolved
by the consultation process and also make it clear that it should be the governing body rather than the recipient's
staff that determines whether there is a conflict.

This rule deletes the requirement for ``effective'' prior public notice, which has proven to be a difficult concept
to enforce and may be very fact-specific. The Board felt that truly effective public notice is virtually impossible
to achieve, even if a recipient spent huge amounts of money on advertising. The Corporation does not wish to promote
such wasteful expenditures or assume that the efforts were not ``effective'' simply because few members of the public
showed up at a board meeting. Instead, the standard should be that of ``reasonable'' prior public notice, so that recipients
would be required to do only what is reasonable under the specific local circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board also considered whether it should include within the regulation specific guidance as to what kinds of matters
were properly discussed in executive session. In response to comments that some boards do not give appropriate notice
of meetings, the Board revised the proposed language of &sect;1607.4(a) to require recipients to have written policies
that are adopted by their governing bodies, so that arbitrary or ad hoc decisions would not be made regarding these
matters. It also decided to recommend that recipients look to the kinds of matters described in the LSC bylaws and Sunshine
Act regulation (45 CFR part 1622), state Sunshine Act provisions, or other provisions in state nonprofit corporation
law for guidance as to the kinds of matters that might appropriately be discussed out of the public eye.

Section 1607.4(b)

New language is added to the rule to clarify that recipient governing bodies have, in addition to the specific functions
described in the regulation, the authority and responsibility inherent in their status as boards of nonprofit corporations.
The Board felt that the current regulatory language does not recognize that general authority, and the Board determined
that it should do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Board added language to make the section consistent with ABA opinions on the role of governing bodies
of legal assistance programs under the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct, especially
with respect to the governing bodies' interference with an attorney's representation of a client or with the conduct
of any ongoing representation. The Board wished to make clear that while recipient board members were prohibited
from such interference, the board as a whole should be encouraged to adopt policies to guide the executive director's
actions when he or she discovers that the recipient has undertaken representation in a case that is inappropriate
under the restrictions of the LSC Act or regulations.

This new provision is intended to make it clear that it is up to recipients to design their own bylaws and that LSC approval
is no longer required. The Corporation would, of course, have authority to review a program's bylaws, as well as any
revisions that are made to them, to insure that they comply with the LSC Act and regulations. Several comments suggested
that the proposed language did not make it clear whether a recipient must submit its bylaws to the Corporation for approval.
Thus, paragraph (c) of the proposed rule was revised to clarify that LSC approval of original or amended bylaws is no
longer required. Recipients need only send the Corporation a copy of any changes to their bylaws within a reasonable
time after the bylaws are revised. Although the Board did not adopt a specific deadline, it noted that a reasonable
time would be approximately 30 days.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The revisions to this section clarify an interpretation of the current rule and make two significant changes dealing
with recipient board member compensation. First, this section has been revised so that the compensation restriction
applies only to attorney board members. Since the provision of the LSC Act that prohibits compensation applies only
to attorney board members, it is consistent with the Act to permit a recipient to pay compensation to a client or other
non-attorney board member for board service or other service to the recipient. Comments were mixed on this provision.
Some wanted to preserve the current rule because it relieves individual programs of the necessity to engage in debate
on the subject. Several comments, on the other hand, suggested that client board members should always be compensated,
and another stated that small stipends for client board members should be made in recognition of the effort that they
make in fulfilling their board responsibilities. The Board adopted the proposed revision, since the statutory language
is limited to the compensation of attorneys. The decision of whether to apply it to client members is purely a local
policy decision to be made by recipients.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second change made in this provision reverses the decision made by the LSC Board in 1988, which interpreted the
language of the LSC Act to prohibit a recipient board member from receiving compensation from any recipient, not just
the one on whose board the member sat. The effect of the 1988 revision was to prohibit field program staff from sitting
on state and national support center boards, and vice versa, and thus prevented support centers from being accountable
through their boards to the programs that they were intended to serve. This revision restores and clarifies the prior
LSC policy that was in existence from 1975 to 1988 and which reflects the intent of Congress. Both the Legal Services
Corporation reauthorization bill that passed the House in 1992 (H.R. 2039) and the bill that was approved by the Senate
Committee on Labor and Human Resources the same year (S. 2870) would have amended the LSC Act in a manner consistent
with this revision. All but one comment favored this revision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this section clarifies that all board members may receive a per diem payment for expenses in lieu of actual
expense reimbursements, so long as such a payment is reasonable in light of actual average costs. Recipients are required
to have written procedures for such payments. Per diem payments may be easier for programs to administer and may encourage
board members to save money on items such as meals and lodging by setting the per diem at a relatively low rate. Language
in the current rule was deleted to make it clear that reimbursement could be made for expenses incurred by recipient
board members on the same terms and conditions that are applicable to non-board members, when such board members are
involved in other program activities not directly related to their board membership or service; e.g., attorney board
members who volunteered to drive a program client to a meeting or a hearing could receive reimbursement for automobile
expenses, or attorney board members who did pro bono work on behalf of the program could receive reimbursement for
travel expenses for attending an out-of-town settlement conference.

This section includes two new provisions that clarify how the compensation prohibition relates to a recipient's
private attorney involvement program. Paragraph (b) makes it clear that, for those rural programs that operate in
areas where there are so few attorneys that it is difficult or impossible to find attorneys willing to serve on program
boards, the Corporation could partially waive the compensation prohibition to allow partners and associates of
board members to participate in judicare or other compensated PAI activities. Comments generally favored this provision.
However, one comment cautioned that the waiver should be limited to those rural situations in which, essentially,
it would be otherwise impossible to recruit attorney board members. According to the comment, ``[t]here is a danger
that the delivery system could be skewed to direct resources towards associates or partners of board members and away
from the employees of the program.'' Most comments spoke of the problems of finding sufficient attorneys in rural
areas to participate in PAI programs. No changes were made to the proposed language in response to comments. However,
it is the intent of the Corporation that the waivers be used sparingly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (c) was added to clarify that attorney board members can receive referrals of fee-generating cases and
participate freely in the recipient's pro bono PAI programs on the same terms as any other attorney. This is particularly
important for rural areas where there are few private attorneys.

There is no change in this waiver provision which was designed to cover those programs, primarily reservation-based
Native-American programs, that existed prior to the creation of the Corporation and had nonattorney majorities
on their boards. In lieu of attorneys, most of those programs include tribal advocates who practice in tribal courts.

Section 1607.6(b)

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This provision is added to permit the Corporation president to waive any of the provisions of this rule that are not
mandated by law, if the recipient demonstrates that it cannot comply with them because of the nature of the population,
legal community or area served or because of special circumstances, such as conflicting requirements of the recipient's
other major funding sources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule had a separate waiver provision for client board membership, but the LSC Board rejected the language.
The proposed waiver for client board membership was intended for recipients that are not statutorily required to
have clients on their boards to seek a waiver from the requirements of this rule. The rule applies to any recipient that
receives financial assistance from the Corporation pursuant to &sect;1006(a)(1)(A) of the LSC Act. The statutory
requirement for client membership, however, applies only to recipients organized solely for the provision of legal
assistance. Comments from client representatives persuaded the Board to continue the client board membership requirement
for any recipients that are subject to this rule. The Board agreed with the comments that any recipient funded by LSC
funds would benefit from the client input and that clients would be better served as a result of their ability to have
input into board policy decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The language of (b)(1) has been amended to include a reference to ``legal community'' to make it clear that the nature
of the legal community, as well as requirements of state law, could be considered as a basis for a waiver. The Board recognized
that there may be programs, especially in rural areas, where there are peculiar problems or situations within the
legal community that may make it necessary or desirable to permit the recipient to have a governing board that varies
from the normal. An example would be for those programs that serve Native American populations and practice in tribal
courts. The president, through the waiver authority, could permit the recipient to substitute one or more tribal
advocates for attorney board members. In addition, this provision could be used as authority for partial waiver of
the compensation prohibition, to permit a recipient to adopt policies that would allow partners or associates of
a board member to participate in compensated PAI activities supported by the recipient.

Section 1607.6(d)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This new provision was added to require that as a condition of granting a waiver under paragraph (b)(2) of this section
from the requirements of &sect;1607.3, the president shall require that the recipient receiving the waiver have
a policy body to establish and enforce policy with respect to the LSC grant. This waiver provision might apply, for
example, to an organization that is not principally a legal assistance organization but gets an LSC grant for legal
assistance activities. The organization would be able to set up a policy board similar to those established for several
of the Delivery Systems Study programs during the late 1970's, to govern the activities covered by the LSC grant. The
Board intends that such a waiver would be given only in very unusual circumstances. Such a policy body would need to
comply with the appointment and membership requirements of &sect;1607.3 and the meeting requirements of &sect;1607.4(a),
and its members would be subject to the compensation prohibitions of &sect;1607.5. The Corporation wanted to make
clear that a policy board is not merely an advisory committee with limited authority to recommend policy to the recipient's
governing body. By definition, such a policy board would be required to have full authority to formulate and enforce
policy with respect to the services provided under the recipient's LSC grant or contract, although it may not necessarily
have any policy-making authority with respect to the recipient's non-LSC funded activities. This provision requires
the president to determine the powers and responsibilities of the policy body that are necessary to carry out its responsibilities
with respect to setting policy for the LSC-funded activities. Because the scope of the powers and responsibilities
of such policy bodies might be different than those of grantees not covered by the waiver, the reference in the proposed
rule to &sect;1607.4 has not been retained in this final rule.

Deletion of Section 1607.7&blank;Compliance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The compliance section of the current regulation is no longer applicable, because it refers to the changes that were
made in the regulation in 1983. None of the revisions would require programs to change anything about their board structures
in order to come into compliance, although they would permit programs to make numerous changes and still remain in
compliance with the regulation. Therefore, the Corporation deletes the provisions on compliance. The Corporation
will insure compliance with the new regulation in the same manner that it insures compliance with the other regulations.

which advocate for or deliver services or resources to the client community served by the recipient. Recipients shall
designate groups in a manner that reflects, to the extent possible, the variety of interests within the client community,
and eligible client members should be selected so that they reasonably reflect the diversity of the eligible client
population served by the recipient, including race, gender, ethnicity and other similar factors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) Upon application, the president shall waive the requirements of this part to permit a recipient that was funded
under &sect;222(a)(3) of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 and, on July 25, 1974, had a majority of persons who were
not attorneys on its governing body, to continue such nonattorney majority. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Upon application, the president may waive any of the requirements of this part which are not mandated by applicable
law if a recipient demonstrates that it cannot comply with them because of: (1) The nature of the population, legal
community or area served; or (2) Special circumstances, including but not limited to, conflicting requirements
of the recipient's other major funding source(s) or State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The policy body shall have such specific powers and responsibilities as the President determines are necessary to
enable it to formulate and enforce policy with respect to the services provided under the recipient's LSC grant or
contract.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
). This final rule designates critical habitat for the delta smelt in the following geographic areas_areas of all
water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded by and contained in Suisun
Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays); the length of Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, First Mallard (Spring
Branch), and Montezuma sloughs; and the existing contiguous waters contained within the Delta, as defined in section
12220 of the California Water Code. Critical habitat designation for the delta smelt will provide additional protection
under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that require Federal agency action.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Historically, the delta smelt is thought to have occurred from Suisun Bay upstream to the City of Sacramento on the
Sacramento River and the City of Mossdale on the San Joaquin River (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992). The delta smelt is a euryhaline species (tolerant of a wide salinity range) that spawns in fresh water and has
been collected from estuarine waters up to 14 grams per liter (equivalent to ppt) salinity (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992). For a large part of its annual life span, this species is associated with the freshwater edge of the mixing zone
(zone of mixing or entrapment at the saltwater-freshwater interface), where the salinity is approximately 2 ppt
(Ganssle 1966, Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Shortly before spawning, adult delta smelt migrate upstream from the highly productive brackish-water habitat
associated with the mixing zone to disperse widely into river channels and tidally-influenced backwater sloughs
(Radtke 1966, Moyle 1976, Wang 1991).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta smelt spawn in shallow, fresh or slightly brackish water upstream of the mixing zone (Wang 1991), mostly in tidally-influenced

1992). Although delta smelt spawning behavior has not been observed in the wild (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992), the adhesive eggs are thought to attach to substrates such as cattails and tules, tree roots, and submerged
branches (Moyle 1976, Wang 1991). In the Delta, spawning is known to occur in the Sacramento River and in Barker, Lindsey,
Cache, Georgiana, Prospect, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore sloughs (Wang 1991; Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993). Delta
smelt also spawn north of Suisun Bay in Montezuma and Suisun sloughs and their tributaries (Lesa Meng, pers. comm.,
1993; Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The spawning season varies from year to year and may occur from late winter (December) to early summer (July and August).
Moyle (1976) collected gravid adults from December to April, although ripe delta smelt were most common in February
and March. In 1989 and 1990, Wang (1991) estimated that spawning had taken place from mid-February to late June or early
July, with the peak spawning period occurring in late April and early May. In 1993, a wet year, spawning may have occurred
as early as January and extended into June (Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1994). Peak spawning occurred in April of that
year. In 1994, a critically dry year, peak spawning occurred at the end of April, and may have begun as early as late February
or early March (Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1994).

In the laboratory, delta smelt eggs hatch in 10 to 14 days (Randy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mager, University of California, pers. comm., 1993). Laboratory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observations indicate that delta smelt are broadcast spawners that spawn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a current, usually at night, distributing their eggs over a local 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area (Lindberg 1992, Mager 1993). Eggs attach singly to the substrate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and few eggs were found on vertical plants (Lindberg 1993). Lindberg 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1993) found that yolk-sac fry were positively phototactic and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
negatively buoyant. After hatching, larvae are transported downstream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toward the mixing zone where they are retained by the vertical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circulation of fresh and salt waters (Stevens 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1990). The pelagic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
larvae feed on phytoplankton until day 4, begin to feed on rotifers on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day 6 and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Artemis nauplii
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on day 14 (Mager 1992). Juveniles feed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusively on zooplankton. When the mixing zone is located in a broad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic area with extensive shallow-water habitat within the euphotic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zone (depths less than 4 meters), high densities of phytoplankton and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
zooplankton are produced (Arthur and Ball 1978, 1979, 1980), and larval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and juvenile fish, including delta smelt, grow rapidly (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). When given the opportunity, delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt remain in Suisun Bay even after the 2 ppt isohaline has retreated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream (Herbold 1994). In general, estuaries are among the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
productive ecosystems in the world (Goldman and Horne 1983). Estuarine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environments produce an abundance of fish as a result of plentiful food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and shallow, protective habitat for young. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the mixing zone is contained within Suisun Bay, young delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt are dispersed widely throughout a large expanse of shallow-water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and marsh habitat. Dispersal in areas downstream from the State and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal water pumps and in-Delta agricultural diversions protects young 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt from entrainment and distributes them among the extensive, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective, and highly productive shoal regions of Suisun Bay. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrast, when located upstream, the mixing zone becomes confined in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deep river channels, which are smaller in total surface area, contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fewer shoal areas, have swifter, more turbulent water currents, and lack 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high zooplankton productivity. Vulnerability to entrainment in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State and Federal pumping facilities and in-Delta diversions increases.

 (1950) collected young delta smelt near Sherman 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Island, at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July and August of 1948. In studies by the California Department of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fish and Game, California Department of Water Resources (DWR), and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bureau, larval and juvenile delta smelt were collected from Roe Island 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Suisun Bay north to the confluence of the Sacramento and Feather 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rivers and east to Medford Island on the San Joaquin River (Wang 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These studies were conducted during the months of April through mid-July 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1989 and 1990. Through these distribution surveys, Wang (1991) was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
able to document the movement of juvenile delta smelt from the Delta to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suisun Bay in late June and early July. In 1990, young delta smelt were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken at the Tracy Pumping Plant at the end of February (Wang 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The delta smelt is adapted to living in the highly productive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary (Estuary) where salinity varies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spatially and temporally according to tidal cycles and the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
freshwater inflow. Despite this tremendously variable environment, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical Estuary probably offered relatively constant suitable habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions to delta smelt, which could move upstream or downstream with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mixing zone (Peter Moyle, University of California, pers. comm., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993). Since the 1850's, however, the amount and extent of suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat for the delta smelt has declined dramatically. The advent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1853 of hydraulic mining in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers led to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased siltation and alteration of the circulation patterns of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary (Nichols 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). The reclamation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Merritt Island for agricultural purposes in the same year marked the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beginning of the present-day cumulative loss of 94 percent of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary's tidal marshes (Nichols 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1986, Monroe and Kelly 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to this degradation and loss of estuarine habitat, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt has been increasingly subject to entrainment, upstream or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reverse flows of waters in the Delta and San Joaquin River, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constriction of habitat in the less productive, deep-water river 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
channels of the Delta (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). These adverse conditions are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primarily a result of the steadily increasing proportion of water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diverted from the Delta by the Federal and State water projects (Monroe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Kelly 1992). Water delivery through the Federal Central Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Project (CVP) began in water year 1940. The State Water Project (SWP) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
began delivering water in 1968. However, the proportion of fresh water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being diverted has increased since 1983 and has remained at high levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992). A relationship has been found between the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of juvenile delta smelt salvaged at the State and Federal pumps and both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the percent of inflow diverted and total Delta outflow (California 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of Water Resources and Bureau of Reclamation 1994). The high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proportion of fresh water exported has exacerbated the already harsh 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental conditions experienced by the delta smelt during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recent 6-year drought (1987&hyph;1992). The March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species describes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detail the factors that have led to this species' decline.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554), Animal Notice of Review, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service included the delta smelt as a category 1 candidate species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Category 1 includes species for which data in the Service's possession 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are sufficient to support proposals for listing. On June 29, 1990, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service received a petition dated June 26, 1990, from Dr. Don C. Erman, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
President-Elect of the California-Nevada Chapter of the American 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fisheries Society, to list the delta smelt as an endangered species and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designate its critical habitat. The Service made a 90-day finding that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial information had been presented indicating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
petitioned action may be warranted and announced this decision in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on December 24, 1990 (55 FR 52852). On October 3, 1991 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(56 FR 50075), the Service published a proposal to list the delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a threatened species and to designate critical habitat. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule constituted the 12-month petition finding in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat was proposed for areas of all water and all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bounded by and contained within Suisun Bay (including the contiguous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grizzly and Honker Bays), the length of Montezuma Slough, portions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Sacramento River, portions of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions of the San Joaquin River, and the contiguous water bodies in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between (a complex of bays, dead-end sloughs, channels typically less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than four meters deep, marshlands, etc.), contained in the State of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California. The public comment period opened on the date of publication 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the proposed rule (October 3, 1991) and closed on January 31, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On December 19, 1991 (56 FR 65877), the Service published a notice 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of public hearing on the proposed rule to be held in three locations in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California. Public hearings were conducted on January 9, 1992, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento; on January 14, 1992, in Santa Monica; and on January 16, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992, in Visalia.

The final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published on March 5, 1993 (58 FR 12854). In the final rule, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service postponed the decision on critical habitat designation. At that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time, the economic analysis necessary to determine critical habitat was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
still in progress. On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reopened the public comment period until April 30, 1993, to allow the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service to consider any economic or biological information that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously had not been submitted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service published a revision to the October 3, 1991, proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule to designate critical habitat for the delta smelt on January 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994 (59 FR 852). The revision was based primarily on information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gathered by the California Department of Fish and Game (Dale Sweetnam, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm., 1993) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
University of California, Davis (Lesa Meng, U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service pers. comm., 1993). This information showed that in 1993, delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt spawned in the Sacramento River, at least as far upstream as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
City of Sacramento and in tidally-influenced shallow freshwater sloughs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Dale Sweetnam, pers. comm., 1993). In 1991, when delta smelt had all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but disappeared from Suisun Marsh, relatively large numbers of delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt were caught in Suisun Slough, as far upstream as Suisun City (Lesa 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Meng, pers. comm., 1993). The revised rule proposed to expand the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic extent of critical habitat to include additional areas now 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known to constitute important spawning habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, in an April 23, 1993, letter received during the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment period, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new scientific information presented in its draft proposed Bay/Delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality standards be considered in the Service's designation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat. The water quality standards were to apply to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Francisco Bay and Delta of the State of California (Bay/Delta) pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section 303 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). As a result of EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis respecting the number of days that low-salinity water was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historically located at three locations in the Estuary, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refined the description of the constituent elements for the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed critical habitat was revised therefore to encompass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream spawning habitats and to better define constituent elements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to protect those areas essential to the recovery of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species. Comment on the revised proposal and its draft economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis was solicited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the same date that the Service published its revised critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat rule, the Service proposed the Sacramento splittail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pogonichthys macrolepidotus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as a threatened species and EPA published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its proposed rule to establish water quality standards for surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waters of the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Delta pursuant to section 303 of the CWA. Those water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are meant to protect the estuary as a whole, and therefore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain more than the salinity criterion. EPA's water quality proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also includes salmon smolt survival criteria to protect fish migration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and cold freshwater habitat designated uses in the estuary in its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 6, 1994, rule, along with proposed striped bass spawning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designation of critical habitat at this time is part of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinated effort between the Service, EPA, National Marine Fisheries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service (NMFS), and the Bureau of Reclamation (Bureau) (collectively, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Club Fed'') to protect and recover the delta smelt and the Estuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ecosystem.

Relationship Between Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA Actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service and EPA recognized that their proposed regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions (e.g., delta smelt critical habitat and EPA's water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards) overlapped biologically and economically. As such, both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies worked closely to provide a comprehensive, ecosystem-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach for the protection of the fish and wildlife resources of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary. This coordination has resulted in regulatory actions that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrated in both substance and timing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biologically, the critical habitat designation for the delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the salinity criteria within EPA's water quality standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directly related. Specifically, salinities of 2 ppt in Suisun Bay were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified as a primary constituent element in the October 3, 1991, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat proposal. Subsequent scientific publications indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that salinities associated with the distribution of delta smelt may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the best basis for setting standards for many species that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected by freshwater discharge from the Estuary (Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
San Francisco Estuary Project 1993). Favorable conditions from February 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through June are important to the abundance and reproductive success of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
almost all species that live in or migrate through the upper Estuary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because EPA's water quality standards address the location of 2 ppt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinities from February to June, its standards will address certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat (water quality) requirements for delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the text of the January, 6, 1994, proposed rule to designate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat for the delta smelt, the Service identified specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinity criteria required to maintain habitat for delta smelt through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its entire life cycle. These criteria had been determined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordination with EPA in preparation of its proposed water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. Subsequent to publication of the critical habitat proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, the Service received many comments objecting to the specificity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the salinity criteria. During numerous discussions with interested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties (and in the following response to comments), Service staff have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
explained that the detailed discussion within the text of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule was meant to clearly describe the need for including a water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality criterion specific to salinity as one primary constituent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element. The actual regulation that was proposed for publication in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Code of Federal Regulations, however, was much less specific as to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
broad flexibility in implementation of the provisions of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, to clarify the Service's intent to preserve the flexibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inherent in implementation of the section 7 regulations, the following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion of the primary constituent elements necessary to define delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt critical habitat, is general in scope. However, the Service has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordinated carefully and extensively with EPA to ensure that EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule promulgating Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Sacramento River, San Joaquin River, and San Francisco Bay and Delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the State of California affords sufficient protection to further the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery of the delta smelt. EPA's final rule is published in this same 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, in a separate part. In its proposed rule, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested that specific comments be submitted on several issues, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the possibility of modifying the Sacramento River Index for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purposes of developing the salinity criteria, alternative approaches 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the averaging period used in its proposed salinity criteria, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluation of the merits of the use of different forms of confidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intervals with the proposed criteria. In developing this final rule, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Service has considered all such comments. These issues also were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed with EPA in regard to the development of its water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards and the Service's section 7 consultation with EPA on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgation of these standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7 of the Act requires that all Federal agencies ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species or adversely modify designated critical habitat. EPA's action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in promulgating water quality standards must comply with the section 7 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation requirement.

Critical habitat is defined in section 3(5)(A) of the Act as ``(i) the specific areas within the geographical area
occupied by the species at the time it is listed *&blank;*&blank;* on which are found those physical or biological
features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations
or protection; and (ii) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed
*&blank;*&blank;* upon a determination *&blank;*&blank;* that such areas are essential for the conservation of
the species.'' The term ``conservation'', as defined in section 3(3) of the Act, means ``*&blank;*&blank;* to use
and the use of all methods and procedures which are necessary to bring an endangered species or threatened species
to the point at which the measures provided pursuant to this Act are no longer necessary.'' With recovery, no protection
from the Act is necessary. Therefore, areas designated as critical habitat must contain those physical or biological
features essential to recover a species to the point that it no longer requires protection under the Act and can be removed
from the list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
endangered and threatened species. Section 3(c) further states that in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most cases the entire range of a species should not be encompassed within critical habitat. Areas outside the present
geographic range may be included as critical habitat if a species' present range would be inadequate to ensure conservation
of the species.

Role in Species Conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that its designation should identify areas that may be needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a species' recovery and delisting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The designation of critical habitat will not, in itself, lead to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery, but is one of several measures available to contribute to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species' recovery. Critical habitat helps focus conservation activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by identifying areas that contain essential habitat features (primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituent elements) regardless of whether or not they are currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occupied by the listed species, thus alerting the public to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance of an area in the conservation of a listed species. Critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat also identifies areas that may require special management or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection. Critical habitat receives protection under section 7 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act with regard to actions carried out, funded, or authorized by Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies. Section 7 requires that Federal agencies consult on actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may affect critical habitat to ensure that their actions are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. This additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection to a species' habitat may actually shorten the time needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
achieve recovery. Aside from this added protection provided by section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7, the Act does not provide other direct forms of protection to lands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated as critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designating critical habitat does not create a management plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish numerical population goals, prescribe specific management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions (inside or out of critical habitat), nor does it have a direct 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on areas not designated as critical habitat. Specific management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations for critical habitat are more appropriately addressed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery plans, management plans, and section 7 consultations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat identifies specific areas essential to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation of a species. Areas with one or more essential features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but not currently containing all of the features and areas having the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capability to provide essential features in the future, may be required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the long-term recovery of the species. This may be so particularly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in certain portions of its range. However, not all areas containing all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
features of a listed species' habitat are necessarily essential to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species' recovery. Areas not included in critical habitat that contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one or more of the essential elements are still important to a species' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation and may be addressed under other facets of the Act and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other conservation laws and regulations. All designated areas also may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be of considerable value in maintaining ecosystem integrity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting other species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designation of critical habitat may be reevaluated and revised, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any time, when new information indicates that changes are warranted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service may revise critical habitat if management plans, recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plans, or other conservation strategies are developed and fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implemented, reducing the need for the additional protection provided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat designation. For example, after the draft Delta Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fishes Recovery Plan (Recovery Plan) is finalized or the State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgates more protective water quality standards for the Estuary than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are currently in place, land and water management agencies may provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased protection for the delta smelt. If these protection measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are implemented, the Service may revise its critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation.

Primary Constituent Elements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining which areas to designate as critical habitat, the Service considers those physical and biological
features that are essential to a species' conservation (50 CFR 424.12(b)). The Service is required to list the known
primary constituent elements together with a description of any critical habitat that is proposed. Such physical
and biological features (i.e., primary constituent elements) include, but are not limited to, the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Space for individual and population growth, and for normal behavior;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Cover or shelter;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Sites for breeding, reproduction, rearing of offspring, germination, or seed dispersal; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Generally, habitats that are protected from disturbance or are representative of the historic geographical
and ecological distributions of a species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary constituent elements essential to the conservation of the delta smelt are physical habitat, water, river
flow, and salinity concentrations required to maintain delta smelt habitat for spawning, larval and juvenile transport,
rearing, and adult migration.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary constituent elements are organized by habitat conditions required for each life stage. The specific
geographic areas and seasons identified for each habitat condition represent the maximum possible range of each
of these conditions. Depending on the water-year type (i.e., wet, above normal, normal, below normal, dry, critically
dry), each of the habitat conditions specified below requires fluctuation (within-year and between-year) in the
placement of the 2 ppt isohaline (a line drawn to connect all points of equal salinity) around three historical reference
points. These three historical reference points are the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence, the upstream
limit of Suisun Bay at Chipps Island, and in the middle of Suisun Bay at Roe Island. The actual number of days that the
2 ppt isohaline is maintained at the three points varies according to water-year type.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, to maintain habitat conditions necessary to achieve recovery of the delta smelt, the number of days at
each reference point must simulate a level of water project development equivalent to that which historically existed
in 1968. A 1968 level of development represents a period of time before Delta outflow was affected by the SWP and the
delta smelt was abundant. This year (1968) falls within the time period identified by the Delta Native Fishes Recovery
Team as having had appropriate hydrologic conditions that would allow recovery of the delta smelt. Additionally,
on June 15, 1994, the Regional Director signed an Interagency Statement of Principles among the Service, NMFS, and
EPA (Plenert, Fullerton, and Seraydarian, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in litt.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1994) stating, in part, despite the effects of the water projects that were operating at that time, the Estuary ecosystem
and its anadromous and resident fisheries were relatively healthy during the years between 1960 and 1970.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, to maintain suitable habitat conditions for recovery of the delta smelt, the naturally-occurring variability
found in healthy estuarine ecosystems must be preserved for the following reasons_(1) temporal and spatial variability
of the 2 ppt isohaline will be the most effective deterrent to further invasion of newly introduced species and continued
competition by those that are already established, (2) placement of the 2 ppt isohaline in Suisun Bay will produce
the high phytoplankton and zooplankton densities that characterize most healthy estuarine ecosystems, and (3)
variability is needed to simulate natural processes and historical conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary constituent elements for the delta smelt are:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Spawning Habitat
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Delta smelt adults seek shallow, fresh or slightly brackish backwater sloughs and edgewaters for spawning. To ensure
egg hatching and larval viability, spawning areas also must provide suitable water quality (i.e., low concentrations
of pollutants) and substrates for egg attachment (e.g., submerged tree roots and branches and emergent vegetation).
Specific areas that have been identified as important delta smelt spawning habitat include Barker, Lindsey, Cache,
Prospect, Georgiana, Beaver, Hog, and Sycamore sloughs and the Sacramento River in the Delta, and tributaries of
northern Suisun Bay. The spawning season varies from year to year and may start as early as December and extend until
July.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Larval and Juvenile Transport
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_To ensure that delta smelt larvae are transported from the area where they are hatched to shallow, productive rearing
or nursery habitat, the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributary channels must be protected from physical
disturbance (e.g., sand and gravel mining, diking, dredging, and levee or bank protection and maintenance) and flow
disruption (e.g., water diversions that result in entrainment and in-channel barriers or tidal gates). Adequate
river flow is necessary to transport larvae from upstream spawning areas to rearing habitat in Suisun Bay. Additionally,
river flow must be adequate to prevent interception of larval transport by the State and Federal water projects and
smaller agricultural diversions in the Delta. To ensure that suitable rearing habitat is available in Suisun Bay,
the 2 ppt isohaline must be located westward of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence during the period when
larvae or juveniles are being transported, according to the historical salinity conditions which vary according
to water-year type. Reverse flows that maintain larvae upstream in deep-channel regions of low productivity and
expose them to entrainment interfere with these transport requirements. Suitable water quality must be provided
so that maturation is not impaired by pollutant concentrations. The specific geographic area important for larval
transport is confined to waters contained within the legal boundary of the Delta, Suisun Bay, and Montezuma Slough
and its tributaries. The specific season when habitat conditions identified above are important for successful
larval transport varies from year to year, depending on when peak spawning occurs and on the water-year type. The Service
identified situations in the biological opinion for the delta smelt (1994) where additional flows might be required
in the July&hyph;August period to protect delta smelt that were present in the south and central Delta from being entrained
in the State and Federal project pumps, and to avoid jeopardy to the species. The long-term biological opinion on CVP&hyph;SWP
operations will identify situations where additional flows may be required after the February through June period
identified by EPA for its water quality standards to protect delta smelt in the south and central Delta.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rearing Habitat
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Maintenance of the 2 ppt isohaline according to the historical salinity conditions described above and suitable
water quality (low concentrations of pollutants) within the Estuary is necessary to provide delta smelt larvae and
juveniles a shallow, protective, food-rich environment in which to mature to adulthood. This placement of the 2 ppt
isohaline also serves to protect larval, juvenile, and adult delta smelt from entrainment in the State and Federal
water projects. An area extending eastward from Carquinez Strait, including Suisun Bay, Grizzly Bay, Honker Bay,
Montezuma Slough and its tributary sloughs, up the Sacramento River to its confluence with Three Mile Slough, and
south along the San Joaquin River including Big Break, defines the specific geographic area critical to the maintenance
of suitable rearing habitat. Three Mile Slough represents the approximate location of the most upstream extent of
tidal excursion when the historical salinity conditions described above are implemented. Protection of rearing
habitat conditions may be required from the beginning of February through the summer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Adult Migration
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Adult delta smelt must be provided unrestricted access to suitable spawning habitat in a period that may extend from
December to July. Adequate flow and suitable water quality may need to be maintained to attract migrating adults in
the Sacramento and San Joaquin River channels and their associated tributaries, including Cache and Montezuma sloughs
and their tributaries. These areas also should be protected from physical disturbance and flow disruption during
migratory periods.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To conserve the delta smelt, this final rule designates critical habitat in an area encompassing the specific habitat
conditions required by each life stage identified above. Accordingly, critical habitat is designated in the following
geographic area_areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded
by and contained in Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays); the length of Goodyear, Suisun,
Cutoff, First Mallard (Spring Branch), and Montezuma sloughs; and the existing contiguous waters contained within
the Delta. Thus, critical habitat for the delta smelt is contained within Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin,
Solano, and Yolo Counties, California. The ``Regulation Promulgation'' section provides a precise metes and bounds
description of critical habitat designated for the delta smelt.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since publication of the revised proposed rule, the Service has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined through section 7 consultations that the South Delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Temporary Barriers Project, deep water navigation channel dredging, Los 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Vaqueros Reservoir Project, and Phase 2 of the Coastal Aqueduct Project 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not jeopardize the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule to revise the critical habitat designation did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify any proposed actions that might jeopardize the delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without adversely affecting critical habitat. In the revised proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule, the Service did identify (based on section 7 consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiences) five activities that, depending on the season of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction and scale of the project, might result in the destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adverse modification of critical habitat without necessarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardizing the continued existence of the delta smelt. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities were:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Sand and gravel extraction in river channels or marshes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Diking wetlands for conversion to farmland and dredging to maintain these dikes; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Levee maintenance and bank-protection activities, such as riprapping, removal of vegetation, and placement
of dredged materials on levees of banks; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Bridge and marina construction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Construction and implementation of each of these five actions requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization by the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) pursuant to section 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and section 404 of the CWA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore are considered Federal actions. In a section 7 consultation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Bureau and the California Department of Fish and Game, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California Department of Water Resources (DWR), the Service reviewed the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure for effects on delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt. As a result, DWR and the Bureau sponsored an investigation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the effects of the operation of the Structure on delta smelt, and DWR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
committed to operate the gates only as required to meet existing Suisun 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Marsh salinity standards. When not operating, the gates on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Structure will remain in the raised position. The effect of gate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation on delta smelt is currently being studied, and the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will make a determination on the Structure's operations in the near 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future. As to the other actions, the Service will consult with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corps as these actions arise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 4, 1994, subsequent to the publication of the January 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, revised proposed rule to designate critical habitat, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transmitted to the Bureau a jeopardy biological opinion on the combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the Federal and State Water Projects on the delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through February 1995. In the 1994 biological opinion, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the proposed operation of the Federal and State Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Projects likely would jeopardize the continued existence of the delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt and would destroy or adversely modify proposed critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This one-year opinion did not recommend a reasonable and prudent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative that distinguished between the number of days of compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the 2 ppt criteria to avoid jeopardy and the number of days of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance that would have been required to avoid destruction or adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification of proposed critical habitat. The Service acknowledges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that such a distinction may be appropriate in future biological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
opinions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any possible revisions to the biological opinion will recognize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
three major initiatives that will shape the dynamics of future estuarine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions for delta smelt. First, in accordance with a Framework 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agreement (1994) between the Governor's Water Policy Council of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State of California (Council) and Club Fed, the State Board will seek 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement with DWR and the U.S. Department of the Interior to operate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the SWP and CVP to make an equitable contribution to meeting the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality standards beginning calendar year 1995. The Board will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seek this agreement while they are working on a water rights decision to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allocate responsibility among water rights holders in the Bay-Delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
watershed. Second, section 7(a)(1) of the Act imposes an affirmative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation on Federal agencies to carry out programs for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation (recovery) of listed species. With the forthcoming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuance of a Delta Native Fishes Recovery Plan, currently in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preparation, the Service expects that local, State, and Federal agencies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will fulfill their responsibilities by assisting in the completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tasks and objectives in the plan. Third, and related to number two, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scheduled renewal of water contracts (i.e., reopened or expired Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licenses, expired CVP water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contracts) will provide an additional opportunity under sections 7(a)(1) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 7(a)(2) of the Act to implement Recovery Plan objectives and meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's water quality standards. Collectively, these initiatives likely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will result in a phased improvement to water quality based habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for the delta smelt. Accordingly, the Service anticipates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that adverse modification or destruction of critical habitat will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
avoided by operation of the CVP, SWP, and other water management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities with implementation of the above described initiatives.

Consideration of Economic and Other Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to consider economic and other relevant impacts of specifying any
particular area to be included within the critical habitat boundary. EPA, in coordination with the Service, included
an analysis of the effects of designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt in its draft Regulatory Impact Assessment
(RIA) for its proposed water quality standards. A summary of that analysis was provided in the revised proposed rule
designating critical habitat for the delta smelt (59 FR 852). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service stated in the revised proposed rule that if the final economic analysis substantially differed from the
draft analysis summarized in the revised proposed rule, a revised analysis would be made available for public comment.
No opportunity for public comment was afforded because the results of the final economic analysis do not substantially
differ from the results of the draft analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's economic analysis assumes that the economic impact of restricting activities associated with construction
and implementation of major water projects would be attributable to the jeopardy standard imposed by listing the
delta smelt as a threatened species, as opposed to designation of critical habitat. Specifically, the impacts of
designating critical habitat are in addition to the economic and other impacts attributable to (1) listing of the
species, (2) economic effects resulting from conservation actions taken by other Federal agencies under section
7(a)(1) of the Act, and (3) regulatory actions required by other laws.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 9 of the Act and Service regulations prohibit the taking of delta smelt without express authorization from
the Service. Under Service regulations, ``take'' may include significant habitat modification or degradation
that actually kills or injures protected species. In addition, Federal agencies must consult with the Service to
ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the listed species. An action could
jeopardize the existence of a listed species if it destroys or modifies its habitat. This is so regardless of whether
that habitat has been designated as critical habitat. Therefore, the direct economic and other impacts resulting
from designation of critical habitat are relatively small because the Act provides substantial protection to habitat
through listing of the species itself. In general, designation of critical habitat supplements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the protection afforded a listed species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The RIA concluded that economic costs attributable to the designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt would
be relatively small. In the revised proposed rule, the Service determined that economic costs would be attributable
to five actions (i.e., sand and gravel extraction, diking wetlands, levee maintenance and bank protection activities,
operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure, and bridge and marine construction). In the final RIA prepared
by EPA (EPA 1994), the economic costs attributable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation were from the same five actions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A synopsis of the economic impacts associated with the five activities identified by the Service includes: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sand and Gravel Operations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Four aggregate operators in the delta may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be affected by the designation of critical habitat. Two of the aggregate operations in the Delta are located in San
Joaquin County, which has a total of eleven aggregate sites. The estimated value of aggregate production for San Joaquin
County in 1986 was $13 million. The four aggregate operations in the Delta that could be affected by the regulation
produced a small percentage of California's aggregate in 1992, which had a total value of $473 million. The economic
impacts on the aggregate production industry resulting from the designation of critical habitat likely will be minor,
given the relatively small amount of sand and gravel production occurring in the Delta. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In many cases, minor changes to the timing of extraction to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitive biological periods will minimize the economic effects on mining activities. Mitigation in the form of
habitat replacement might be required for operations that may result in the destruction or adverse modification
of critical habitat. Costs to restore 1 acre of wetlands range between $10,000 to $50,000. Mitigation costs could
be reduced if low-cost lands were acquired, and levees were breached to flood areas. For some tracts of land, the costs
associated with restoring wetlands may exceed the value derived from the agricultural activity, in which case the
cost attributable to critical habitat would be the loss in agricultural income.

Diking and Dredging for Agricultural Operations
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Though designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of critical habitat for the delta smelt may require implementation of best management practices and a 3:1 ratio of
permanently destroyed habitat in proposed project areas, the economic impacts of restricting diking and dredging
operations are expected to be minimal. For example, the regulatory costs (i.e., with critical habitat designated)
associated with converting the Little Holland Tract in the Delta to agricultural uses with critical habitat designated
would be the cost to replace 440 acres of habitat at a 3:1 ratio (EPA 1994). The expense of replacing habitat would likely
exceed the economic returns from agricultural production on this tract, which was historically planted for corn.
Foregone income from future agricultural production on the 1,300 arable acre tract would amount to $65,000 per year.

Levee Maintenance
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_Between 1981&hyph;1991, local agencies maintained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
536.6 miles of levee in the Delta, spending an average of $1.24 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per mile (EPA 1994). Approximately 41% of the costs were financed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through State subventions. The costs of levee maintenance are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to increase significantly due to this critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation because Federal regulatory agencies currently have timing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and construction restrictions that generally avoid adverse effects to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
_The economic impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure could not be estimated by the time this final
rule was published. In response to a biological opinion issued by the USFWS to DWR and the Bureau on the Structure's
operation, an investigation of the effects of the Structure on delta smelt is being conducted, and will be completed
in the near future. The Structure's operations may be modified once the study is completed. The gates at this structure
are currently operated from November to March in accordance with current State salinity standards to maintain low-salinity
water in Suisun Marsh, but remain open the remainder of the year.

_The use of best management practices, time restrictions, and other construction restrictions similar to those
for levee maintenance and sand and gravel operations should preclude any substantial impact from designation of
delta smelt critical habitat on bridge and marina construction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's economic analysis evaluated the costs associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing its water quality standards for the Bay/Delta. Since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service identifies water quality (salinity) as a primary constituent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element essential to conserve the delta smelt, an analysis of the water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs associated with implementing the salinity standards is included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this final rule. Though the water costs associated with the water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality standards are attributable to EPA, the Service includes this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion to make clear the approximate cost of implementing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinity standards alone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The water costs associated with the salinity standards and fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
migration standards are reported in EPA's final RIA (EPA 1994). EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports the water costs as the sum of costs associated with the salinity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards and fish migration standards. However, depending on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrologic conditions, approximately 35% to 73% of the water costs in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA economic analysis can be attributed to the salinity criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alone, apart from the fish migration criteria (EPA 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The overall estimated water supply impacts of both the salinity and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish migration water quality standards (change in total exports) over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those associated with existing D&hyph;1485 State salinity standards and water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality requirements for winter-run chinook salmon under a NMFS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological opinion are 376 thousand acre-feet (taf) per year on average, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 577 taf during critically dry periods. However, the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation plan for EPA's water quality standards will substantially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affect the magnitude and distribution of the costs associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing the water quality standards. A more detailed discussion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the water costs associated with different implementation scenarios 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appears in the final RIA (EPA 1994).

National Economic Costs

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Actions taken to preserve and recover threatened and endangered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species may result in the re-allocation of resources within the regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and national economy. National economic costs, best described as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
efficiency costs, include changes in the consumer and producer surplus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and related employment impacts. These measures capture the net social 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gains and losses resulting from the resource allocation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The national economic cost of the five activities evaluated above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(sand and gravel extraction, diking wetlands, levee maintenance and bank 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection activities, operation of the Montezuma Slough Control 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Structure, and bridge and marina construction) is minimal since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overall economic cost of those activities in the region is minimal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's economic analysis used the above described measures to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate the costs and benefits of the water quality standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the results of EPA's economic analysis is identical to an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis done for national economic costs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation of the delta smelt with designation of its critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat will result in a wide range of benefits. Section 2(a)(3) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act recognizes that fish, wildlife, and plants are of aesthetic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ecological, educational, historical, recreational, and scientific value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the Nation and its people. EPA (1994) categorizes the benefits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgating water quality standards and designating critical habitat as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use, nonuse, and other benefits. A more detailed description of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uses are contained in the final RIA (EPA 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several use and nonuse benefits can be attributed to designating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat for the delta smelt, apart from benefits attributable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to EPA's water quality standards. Generally, the designation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat will prevent the further decline of estuarine health. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Benefits include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Reduced need in the future to list fish and wildlife species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently in decline; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Increased biological production of commercially important 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species, such as waterfowl and salmon; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Increased protection to a wide variety of estuarine species, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
several of which are unique to the Estuary (e.g., winter-run chinook 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salmon, Estuary population of longfin smelt, and Sacramento 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
splittail); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Curtailed establishment of newly introduced exotic species and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deterred explosion of the current population of already established 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exotic species; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Increased recreational fishing and hunting opportunities;

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) Increased opportunities for wildlife observation resulting from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restoration of riparian and tidal marsh habitat and ecosystem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Improved commercial fishery harvest as a result of increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
populations of fish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA (1994) assigned a monetary value to several of the use benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic benefits of EPA's standards are broader than protection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delta smelt, since EPA's standards are expected to positively affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all components of the food web. The total economic benefit of EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality standards and the designation of critical habitat for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt are reported as follows. The ecological benefits of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improved estuarine conditions are expected to generate at least $2.1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million or more in net economic benefits to commercial and recreational 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fisheries (particular salmon fisheries), and will have an associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment gain of approximately 145 full-time equivalent jobs (EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994). Benefits to the ocean sport fishery for salmon is estimated at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about $708,000 annually (EPA 1994). This increase would result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
positive employment effects on sport fishing-related industry, adding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 70 jobs in this area. Annual benefits to the striped bass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sport fishing industry is estimated to be $57,500 annually (EPA 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An important avoided cost is associated with further declines in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recreational and commercial fisheries industry of the Bay/Delta, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is valued at $200 million annually (EPA 1994). Other avoided 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
costs include government costs associated with crop deficiency payments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agricultural drainage costs, and costs associated with the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction in property value.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to determine the specific extent of designation of critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of the Act, the Service must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyze: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The benefits of excluding an area as critical habitat, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The benefits of including an area, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The effects of exclusions on the probability of species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This process consists of (1) estimating the benefits of retaining or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluding land and water areas contained within Suisun Bay or river 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaches within the Delta and Montezuma, Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First Mallard (Spring Branch) sloughs; (2) weighing those benefits; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) determining if exclusion of an area or areas from critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will lead to the extinction of the species. If the exclusion of an area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or areas from critical habitat will result in eventual species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extinction, then the exclusion would be prohibited under the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Extinction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Critical habitat consists of areas with habitat characteristics that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are essential to the conservation of a listed species. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion process focuses upon a threshold for species extinction. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Conservation (recovery) and extinction are separate standards. Recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and extinction are at opposite ends of a continuum, with the likelihood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a species' continued survival increasing the closer the species is to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recovery end of the continuum. It may be more difficult to predict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the point at which extinction would be inevitable than to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where recovery may occur. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis to determine whether extinction will occur will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different for each species, depending on many variables, including a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species' geographic range. The exclusion analysis also may be related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a number of factors, such as the number of individuals, amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat, condition of the habitat, and reproductive success. Extinction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of an annual species, like the delta smelt, most likely would occur when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rearing habitat conditions are poor enough for two consecutive years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that some minimum number of fish fail to survive to reproduce. Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions could become poor enough if pumping at Federal and State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water project facilities and private diversions significantly reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outflow from the Delta. If a sufficient number of delta smelt were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrained in Federal and State water project facilities and private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diversions so that a minimal number survived to reproduce, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population could decline. Extinction could result. The focus of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusionary analysis was on those factors that pertain to these issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and included consideration of habitat condition, functioning of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary ecosystem, and proximity of the delta smelt population to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal and State pumps during various life stages.

Criteria and Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In evaluating the designation of critical habitat to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether or not to exclude areas because of concerns over economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects, the Service used the following process: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Based upon the criteria described in this document, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographical area essential to the conservation of the species was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) An economic analysis was conducted to ascertain the anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic consequences of designating areas as critical habitat, using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agricultural and urban sectors as the primary level of economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Service balanced the costs and other impacts of designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the benefits of designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Using the above described process, the Service has determined that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no exclusions to critical habitat are appropriate. The entire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
geographic area designated as critical habitat is essential to conserve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delta smelt. Delta smelt are restricted to a limited geographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, and retaining land and water areas contained within Suisun Bay and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river reaches within the Delta and Montezuma, Goodyear, Suisun, Cutoff, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and First Mallard (Spring Branch) sloughs is necessary to recover this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual species. These areas provide habitat necessary for each life 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stage of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The economic consequences of designating the entire area as critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat are relatively small. Most economic costs can be avoided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
project proponents by using timing and construction restrictions, and by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using best management practices. Designation of critical habitat will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduce the need in the future to list fish and wildlife species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently in decline, and will improve the overall health of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary. The benefits of designating the entire area outweigh the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits of excluding any of the area from the designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Available Conservation Measures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the Act, as stated in section 2(b), is to provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means to conserve the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species depend and to provide a program for the conservation of listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species. Section 2(c)(1) of the Act declares that ''*&blank;*&blank;* all Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
departments and agencies shall seek to conserve endangered and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threatened species and shall utilize their authorities in furtherance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the purposes of this Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act mandates the conservation of listed species through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different mechanisms, such as: Section 7 (requiring Federal agencies to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further the purposes of the Act by carrying out conservation programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and insuring that Federal actions will not likely jeopardize the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued existence of the listed species or result in the destruction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adverse modification of critical habitat); section 9 (wildlife 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
research permits and habitat conservation planning on non-Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands); section 6 (cooperative State and Federal grants), land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acquisition, and research. Other Federal laws also require conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of endangered and threatened species, such as the National Forest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, and various 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other State and Federal laws and regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat is not intended as a management or conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plan. Critical habitat is primarily intended to identify the habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that meets the criteria for the primary constituent elements. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there are benefits that result from the designation. Designation will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
help retain recovery options and reduce the near-term risk until a long-term conservation plan is implemented. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designation of critical habitat does not offer specific direction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for managing delta smelt habitat. That type of direction, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any change in direction, will come through the administration of other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facets of the Act (e.g., section 7, section 10 HCP process, and recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
planning). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Recovery Planning

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Recovery planning under section 4(f) of the Act is the ``umbrella''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that eventually guides all the Act's activities and promotes a species' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation and eventual delisting. Recovery plans provide guidance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which may include population goals and identification of areas in need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of protection or special management. Recovery plans usually include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management recommendations for areas proposed or designated as critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The delta smelt and six other fish species that depend on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary for a significant segment of their life history are included in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Native Fishes Recovery Plan. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery plan is currently in draft form. The recovery plan will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include recovery criteria based on population abundance and geographic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distribution. Designation of critical habitat, along with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological opinion evaluating the effects of the Federal and State water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projects on the delta smelt, is consistent with the plan's objective to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recover these fish species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 7(a)(2) of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to destroy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adversely modify critical habitat. This Federal responsibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accompanies, and is in addition to, the requirement in section 7(a)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Act that Federal agencies ensure that their actions do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Jeopardy is defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as any action that would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to appreciably reduce the likelihood of both the survival and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery of a species. Destruction or adverse modification of critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat defined at 50 CFR 402.02 as a direct or indirect alteration that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appreciably diminishes the value of critical habitat for both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survival and recovery of a listed species. The regulations also clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state that such alterations include, but are not limited to, alterations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adversely modifying any of those physical or biological features that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were the basis for determining the habitat to be critical. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Survival and recovery, mentioned in both the definition of adverse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modification and jeopardy, are directly related. Survival may be viewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a linear continuum between recovery and extinction of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The closer one is to recovery, the greater the certainty in the species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued survival. The terms ``survival and recovery'' are, thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
related by the degree of certainty that the species will persist over a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given period of time. Survival relates to viability. Factors that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influence a species' viability include population numbers, distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the range, stochasticity, expected duration, and reproductive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
success. A species may be considered recovered when there is a high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degree of certainty for the species' continued viability. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act's definition of critical habitat indicates that the purpose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of critical habitat is to contribute to a species' conservation, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by definition equates to recovery. Section 7 prohibitions against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat apply to actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would impair survival and recovery of a listed species, thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
providing a regulatory means of ensuring that Federal actions within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat are considered in relation to the goals and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recommendations of a recovery plan. As a result of the link between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat and recovery, the prohibition against destruction or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse modification of the critical habitat should provide for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection of the critical habitat's ability to contribute to a species' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Federal actions that may affect the delta smelt or its critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat include those authorized, carried out, or funded by the Corps, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Department of the Navy, the Bureau, NMFS, FERC, the Service, and EPA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Corps funds projects and issues permits for water pumping and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diversion facilities, levee construction or repair, bank protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, deep-water navigation channel dredging and dredge spoil 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal projects, sand and gravel extraction, marina and bridge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction, diking of wetlands for conversion to farmland, and tidal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gate or barrier installation. The Corps also develops permits pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to section 404 of the CWA to the Department of the Navy so the Navy may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dredge deep-water ship channels and dispose of dredge materials in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, and San Francisco Bay. The Corps also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducts such activities for the Navy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau and DWR construct, operate, and manage water export 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. EPA reviews State water quality standards and promulgates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement standards, pursuant to the CWA, if the State standards are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found to be inadequate. FERC licenses water storage facilities on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tributaries to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. In 1991, EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disapproved portions of the State Board's Water Quality Control Plan for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Salinity for the Estuary. Accordingly, EPA has prepared proposed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
finalized replacement standards for those portions of the State's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinity standards that were disapproved. Measures to protect the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
federally listed winter-run chinook salmon, for which NMFS has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction under the Act, also may affect the delta smelt and may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require consultation with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service and the Bureau are jointly responsible for implementing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA). Activities under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CVPIA include, but are not limited to, management of a portion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the CVP water supply dedicated for fish and wildlife protection, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restoration, and enhancement, acquisition of additional water supplies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the same purposes, and screening unscreened diversions in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento-San Joaquin watershed. Both the Bureau and Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities under the CVPIA may affect delta smelt or its critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat, requiring consultation with the Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under section 4 of the Act, listing of the delta smelt provided a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for the development of a recovery plan. The Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
convened the Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team to prepare a Recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plan for declining native fishes in the Estuary. The Recovery Plan, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently in draft form, will develop a framework for Federal, State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and private entities to coordinate activities and cooperate with each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other in conservation efforts. The plan will set recovery priorities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and estimate the costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goals. Site-specific management actions necessary to achieve survival 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and recovery of the delta smelt and other fishes native to the Estuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ecosystem also will be described in this plan.

Summary of Comments and Recommendations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt was first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed on October 3, 1991 (56 FR 50075), as part of the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to list the species. During the 4-month comment period following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
publication of the proposal, the Service received 360 written and oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments from 348 individuals. Of the forty-four people who commented 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically on critical habitat, thirty-four opposed and ten supported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On March 16, 1993 (58 FR 14199), the Service published a notice that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public comment period on the original proposed critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation for the delta smelt was reopened until April 30, 1993, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allow the Service to consider any information that previously had not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been submitted. In response, the Service received seven letters_two in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
support of critical habitat designation as proposed, four in opposition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a letter from EPA requesting that the Service consider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological and hydrological information described in EPA's draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule to promulgate Bay/Delta water quality standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On January 6, 1994 (59 FR 852), the Service revised the geographical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area and refined the primary constituent elements described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original critical habitat proposal. The public comment period for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised proposed critical habitat designation was open from January 6, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, to March 7, 1994, and later extended to March 11, 1994 (59 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3829). During the 65-day comment period, the Service received written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments from forty-three parties on both the critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation and EPA's proposed water quality standards for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay/Delta. Thirty-two commenters were opposed to critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation, nine supported the decision, and two expressed no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preference. Several commenters either referenced or supported the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments of the California Urban Water Agencies (CUWA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four joint public hearings were held to solicit comments on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised proposed critical habitat designation, the proposed threatened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status for the Sacramento splittail, and the proposed water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards developed by EPA. A total of 125 people presented oral 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testimony and submitted written comments at the hearings, primarily on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt critical habitat and Bay/Delta water quality standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues. The Service received comments from elected officials, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested persons, municipal and agricultural water districts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associations, environmental organizations, business and industry owners 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and managers, fishing enthusiasts, farmers, agricultural commissions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dairy interests, biologists, county and municipal officials, power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency representatives, hospital and school district representatives, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and building industry spokespeople. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the February 23, 1994, hearing in Fresno, thirty-eight people 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented oral testimony_thirty-six people opposed and two supported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat designation. Nineteen people testified at the February 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24, 1994, Sacramento meeting_fifteen people were opposed to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation, three were in support, and one person was neutral. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Twelve people testified at the February 25, 1994, hearing in San 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Francisco_nine people supported and three opposed the critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation. At the February 28, 1994, hearing in Irvine, fifty-six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people presented oral and written comments (fifty-one people testified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and five submitted only written comments)_fifty of the fifty-six 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters opposed critical habitat, five were neutral, and one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supported the designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments addressing the issue of available scientific information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to revise the proposed rule were addressed in the revised proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule of January 6, 1994 (59 FR 852). The Service addressed EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, as well as comments provided by the State. All other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments are addressed below in this final rule. Because EPA can better 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respond to comments regarding the economic analysis and the assumptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used to develop its Bay/Delta water quality standards, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refers to EPA's ``Response to Comments'' document for responses to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments specific to those issues. However, the Service will respond to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any comments regarding the relationship between EPA's water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards and the biological requirements of the delta smelt in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section, and to comments regarding the economic analysis as it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the critical habitat designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments are part of the administrative record and are available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public review. Written comments and oral statements presented at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public hearings and received during the comment periods are covered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following summary. Comments of a similar nature or point are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grouped into a number of general issues. These issues, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service's response to each, are discussed below.

Comment 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought the Service should not adopt EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay/Delta water quality standards as part of the designation of critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat for the delta smelt. The commenter asserted that because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service had not described the biological relevance of the standards, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopting the standards would be ``throwing water at the problem''. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter thought EPA's criteria were developed to serve non-habitat purposes, reasoning that their purpose
was to remove organisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from risk of mortality at the pumps. Another commenter thought flow, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rather than salinity or the location of the entrapment zone, was a more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate parameter to protect the western Delta and Suisun Marsh. A 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter at the public hearings believed the Service should not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected such a strict standard of salinity (2 ppt) for the delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt's critical habitat.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service does not adopt EPA's water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards in the designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service identifies water quality (salinity) as a primary constituent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
element to protect and recover the delta smelt. This point is described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in detail in comment 27, below, and is clarified in the section entitled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Primary Constituent Elements'' in this final rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has considered and discussed the biological relevance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's water quality standards. The biological relevance of providing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ample estuarine habitat for the delta smelt was first discussed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original proposed designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991. The biological significance of salinity in the Estuary was again 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in the sections entitled ``Revisions to the October 3, 1991, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical Habitat Proposal'', ``Habitat Requirements'', and ``Primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Constituent Elements'' in the January 6, 1994, revised proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation of critical habitat. These sections discuss the habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of the delta smelt, the need for temporal and spatial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variability of low-salinity waters in the Estuary, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification of primary constituent elements essential for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery of the smelt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the above cited discussions illustrate, EPA's water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards were developed to mimic historical habitat conditions and were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not developed to simply serve non-habitat purposes. The standards may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidentally serve ``non-habitat'' purposes by removing organisms from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk of mortality at the pumps. This topic is discussed in this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule in the ``Primary Constituent Element'' section for larval and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
juvenile transport.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring flows to maintain salinity at critical locations in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta will not be ``throwing water at the problem.'' The Service has used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the best scientific data available to prescribe conditions that will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilitate the recovery of the delta smelt, relying on scientific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidence and testimony presented during the State Board's 1992 hearing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process, as well as information from the Service and the panel of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientists who participated in the San Francisco Estuary Project (SFEP).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Act and its regulations, the Service may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refer to either flow or salinity as water quality criteria when critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat is designated for the delta smelt. Because the Act is flexible, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Service may accomplish recovery in a variety of ways, so long as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed species are recovered. With critical habitat defined, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service must identify the physical and biological features essential to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the conservation of the species, and which may require special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management considerations or protection. A primary constituent element 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may include either water quality or water quantity. Special management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considerations include ``any methods or procedures useful in protecting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
physical and biological features of the environment for the conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a listed species.'' (50 CFR 424.12(b); 424.02(j)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the best available information, the Service concludes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criteria are necessary to protect and recover the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta smelt are associated with the freshwater edge of the mixing zone, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the salinity is approximately 2 ppt (Ganssle 1966, Moyle 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1992, Sweetnam and Stevens 1993). In most years, the majority of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt population lives at salinities of less than 2 ppt for most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the year (Moyle 1976, Ganssle 1966).

Comment 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although several water purveyors agreed with EPA that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a relationship between the average position of the 2 ppt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isohaline and the health of the Estuary, they believed that the Roe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Island criterion was too protective and should be abolished. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another commenter thought the water quality standards as proposed by EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were not protective enough of the delta smelt (addressed in comment 7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters thought that requiring compliance at Roe Island may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) reduce the within-year variability in hydrology in Suisun Bay, thus 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
having an adverse impact on the biology of the Estuary; (2) place the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrapment zone too far downstream of Suisun Bay, thereby pushing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phytoplankton and delta smelt out past Carquinez Strait into San Pablo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay; and (3) either greatly benefit or adversely affect native and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced estuarine species by enhancing or adversely affecting habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity and quality.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To the extent feasible, maintenance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
near-historical water quality conditions at Roe Island is essential to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery of the delta smelt. Not only is it important to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-salinity conditions at critical locations in the Estuary depending 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the life-stage of the delta smelt, but also to simulate year-to-year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural spring storm cycles so that natural processes and historical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions can be mimicked in the Estuary. The water quality standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed by EPA, including criteria at Roe Island, Chipps Island, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence, were developed to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both within-year and between-year variability in salinity levels, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristic of the Estuary in the late 1960's and early 1970's. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variability does not currently occur frequently enough in the Estuary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintain estuarine processes, because the construction of water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conveyance facilities in the Central Valley and Delta, as well as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of diversions and upstream dams, have reduced and dampened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual fluctuations in Delta outflow.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A low-salinity reference point at Roe Island will provide within-year and year-to-year variability essential to
maintenance of a healthy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary. Requiring salinity be maintained intermittently at Roe Island 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also will provide flows to carry juvenile fish from the Delta downstream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Suisun Bay, and will maximize nutrient inputs from Suisun Marsh and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the shallows of Suisun Bay into the mixing zone. Providing periodic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low-salinity water at Roe Island will significantly increase the total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area of medium to low-salinity nursery habitat available for delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt. Spring storm events are also beneficial to aquatic resources of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Estuary, providing areas of flooded vegetation for the spawning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some estuarine species.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, the 2 ppt isohaline is needed sporadically at Roe Island 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to mimic seasonal variability of Delta flow to deter the invasion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
introduced species. The lack of seasonal and yearly variability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta outflows has contributed to the invasions of introduced species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because variable salinity is one of the dominant features of an estuary, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensuring natural variability in the Estuary can only benefit native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estuarine species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Providing low-salinity water at the Roe Island historical reference point will not put the mixing zone too far downstream
into the Carquinez Strait. Conversely, completely abolishing the Roe Island reference point and relying exclusively
on the Chipps Island and Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence locations may leave an important area in the western-most
portion of Suisun Bay (which is included in critical habitat) outside the mixing zone (CCCWA/EDF 1987). The western
portion of Suisun Bay is important habitat for the delta smelt. Delta smelt were most abundant at the Western Suisun
Bay and Carquinez Strait sampling sites in the San Francisco Bay-Outflow Study in the years 1980&hyph;1988 (Stevens

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et al. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1990). Apart from the ship channel, the southwestern portion of Suisun Bay contains expansive shoal areas that are
less than 2 meters deep (Mortensen 1987). The best survival and growth of delta smelt larvae occur when optimum conditions
in the mixing zone occupy a large area that includes extensive shoal regions containing suitable rearing substrates
within the euphotic zone (depths less than 4 meters).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, because the Roe Island historic reference point was developed to mimic historical conditions in the Estuary,
requiring periodic low-saline waters at that location will not be an abnormal occurrence. Historically, delta smelt
have been flushed out into the Carquinez Strait and into Suisun Bay in high flow years, similar to what occurred in 1983
and 1993. The delta smelt is adapted to living in the Estuary, where salinity varies spatially and temporally according
to tidal cycles and the amount of freshwater inflow. Nonetheless, the historical Estuary probably offered relatively
constant suitable habitat conditions to delta smelt, which could move upstream or downstream with the entrapment
zone (Peter Moyle, University of California, pers. comm., 1993).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service does not believe EPA's Roe Island salinity criteria would be detrimental to native estuarine species.
A qualitative and graphic analysis of habitat preferences for Estuary species (including eggs and larvae, juveniles,
adults and spawning adults life stages) presented by a commenter which predicted that EPA's salinity criteria at
Roe Island would put some species at risk or greatly benefit others was overly broad and too simplistic. The commenter
included introduced species (e.g., inland silverside 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Menidia beryllina, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and marine species (e.g., several surfperches, English sole 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Parophrys vetulis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) in the analysis. Its analysis did not give any preference to species having protected status, or to species that rely
solely on estuarine habitat. Freshwater, marine and estuarine-dependent species were treated equally. The analysis
described habitat in terms of salinity alone, when other measures of habitat, such as temperature, turbidity, and
depth, are important for some estuarine-dependent species. Since the quantity of habitat available for a species
was described only by river kilometer, complex bathymetry was ignored in the investigation. The Service does not
intend to benefit or recover species outside the Estuary, nor does it intend to protect introduced estuarine species.
To comply with the Act, the Service must promote the recovery of the delta smelt. Impeding the establishment and success
of introduced species, and providing suitable habitat for delta smelt, are significant and complementary components
to recovering the species. The Service does not foresee a significant decline in other native estuarine species due
to critical habitat designation for the delta smelt. The Service expects the opposite to occur and has evaluated the
impacts of EPA's water quality standards through section 7 consultations.

Comment 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought the Roe Island criteria would not benefit the delta smelt because the relationship between
the 2 ppt isohaline location and the abundance indices of delta smelt become uncertain as the entrapment zone moves
downstream from Chipps Island.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service need not show statistical significance between the location of the mixing zone and fishery abundance
to include variable, low-salinity habitat as a primary constituent element. Under the Act, the Service must base
a critical habitat designation on the best scientific information available. A statistical correlation between
a primary constituent element and its effect on species recovery is not required. The complexity of the Delta ecosystem
and the numerous factors contributing in time and space to the species' decline make it highly unlikely that any one
factor would show a direct correlation with its potential recovery.

affect winter-run salmon temperature requirements.

 The Service is addressing, in recovery planning efforts and in section 7 consultations, the concern that compliance
with Roe Island criteria will cause reductions in carryover storage in upstream reservoirs. Recovery planning recommendations
for winter-run chinook salmon will be included in the delta smelt recovery plan process through coordination of the
respective recovery teams for these species. Section 7 consultations will address any competing needs for winter-run

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter thought that the State Water Project and the Central Valley Project reservoirs located upstream of
the Delta lacked the capacity to release enough controlled outflow to regulate salinity at Roe Island on a continuous
basis, when recreational safety, flooding, travel time and upstream riparian right constraints are taken into account.

Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service notes the isohaline need not be located at Roe Island on a continuous basis, since EPA's Roe Island standard
is triggered only when uncontrolled runoff has placed the 2 ppt isohaline seaward of Roe Island. The SWP and CVP reservoirs
have the capacity to release outflow to meet the Roe Island criteria once the criteria are triggered.

 The Service addressed the concerns regarding data bias in the final rule to list the delta smelt as a threatened species
(58 FR 12856), noting that the Service is obliged under the Act to use the best available scientific and commercial
information in making a listing determination. The Service also must use the best available information in designating
critical habitat, and must take into consideration the economic impact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying
any particular area as critical habitat (section 4(b)(2)).

Comment 7:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter thought the salinity standards as proposed by the EPA were not protective enough of the delta smelt,
and recommended that_(1) additional days be added to the Roe Island standard in below normal to critically dry years
to buffer against years when storm flows or reservoir releases place the 2 ppt isohaline at Roe Island for the first
time late in the year, (2) a stipulation be added for an eleventh-hour invocation'' of the 2 ppt standard if it appears
that the 2 ppt requirement will fail to be invoked at all, and (3) the Service include a Middle Ground standard in addition
to the Roe Island standard, having the Middle Ground standard implemented independently of any type of trigger or
stipulation. The commenter thought water quality criteria at Middle Ground were necessary not only to provide rearing
habitat immediately west of Chipps Island (since habitat in that area is positively correlated with delta smelt abundance),
but also would allow delta smelt to access the expansive shoals of Grizzly Bay through Honker Bay. Another commenter
worried that simply reproducing historic habitat conditions would not be sufficient to recover the delta smelt.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service believes that EPA's water quality standards, as proposed, will afford protection and promote recovery
of the delta smelt. Adding additional independent (i.e., no trigger) criteria at Middle Ground location (between
Roe Island and Chipps Island) would defeat the purpose of the Roe Island standard by dampening any variability in the
yearly pattern of outflow as discussed in the preceding response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Use of the term ``conservation'' in the definition of critical habitat indicates that its designation should identify
areas that may be needed for a species' recovery and delisting. However, when critical habitat is designated at the
time a species is listed, the Service frequently does not know exactly what may be needed for recovery. In this regard,
critical habitat serves to preserve options for a species' eventual recovery. The Service will address the cause(s)
and remedies for delta smelt decline in the recovery planning process and in future section 7 consultations as new
information develops.

Comment 8:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter suggested a mechanism for phased compliance be developed for EPA's water quality standards. Another
commenter suggested that the standards be set aside in critically dry years until their exact utility in recovering
the delta smelt and the estuary is quantified.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One of the purposes of designating critical habitat is to identify areas that may be needed for a species' recovery
and delisting so that options can be retained for the realization of this goal. The Service recognizes that the degradation
of delta smelt critical habitat has occurred over more than a century and that, as a result, it is unreasonable to expect
that recovery will be achieved in a relatively short timeframe. Please refer to ``The Effects of Critical Habitat''
section above for a detailed discussion on how the Framework Agreement (1994), the section 7(a)(1) mandate, and CVP
water contract renewals will, in essence, allow compliance with EPA's water quality standards to be phased in.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Act does not permit the protections provided by critical habitat to be delayed in ways that may result
in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat, such as what may occur in drier water years. Having
threatened status under the Act means that the delta smelt is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future
throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Designating critical habitat will facilitate the recovery
(i.e., delisting) of the delta smelt, rather than allowing the species to continue declining into endangered status.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water quality (salinity) in the Estuary has been identified by the Service as a primary constituent element essential
to the conservation of the delta smelt. A significant modification to EPA's water quality standards, or a substantial
delay or break in designating critical habitat for the delta smelt, would not only postpone recovery of the species
but could adversely impact the species. The delta smelt's pelagic life history, dependence on pelagic microzooplankton,
1-year life span, limited geographic range, and low fecundity make it susceptible to decimation if its reproductive
or larval nursery areas are disturbed for more than two years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In formulating the basis for the economic impact analysis, the Service assumed that destruction or adverse modification
of critical habitat would not occur in any given water year, provided that Federal and State agencies and other parties
comply with flows required in biological opinions interim to the State Board's implementation of water quality standards,
and that Federal and State agencies are making satisfactory progress towards implementing recovery plan objectives.

Comment 9:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Agricultural interests and municipal representatives making comments in the public hearings felt the designation
of critical habitat for the delta smelt and EPA's estuarine standards would cause water allocation in California
to be inflexible, especially in light of expanding municipal water needs for population growth, natural disasters
(e.g., earthquakes and fires) and expanding industry. One commenter was concerned that by designating critical
habitat for the delta smelt, construction of new Delta water conveyance facilities would be prevented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Designating critical habitat for the delta smelt will not cause water allocation in California to be inflexible.
Section 7 of the Act requires Federal agencies to consult on actions that may affect delta smelt to ensure that their
actions are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. The Service provides advisory recommendations
under section 7 by consulting with other Federal agencies to identify and help resolve conflicts between listed species,
their critical habitat, and proposed actions. Management actions designed to provide protection for delta smelt
through formal consultation or the section 10 incidental take permit process can be achieved in a variety of ways by
considering a range of project alternatives or measures. The consultation and permitting processes are flexible,
designed to identify solutions on either a project-by-project or regional basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A critical habitat designation will not necessarily preclude the construction of new Delta water conveyance facilities.
The Service's economic analysis for designating critical habitat assumed that construction of water facilities
for future economic growth is more affected by application of the jeopardy standard, rather than critical habitat
designation. Nonetheless, these economic assumptions do not constrain the Service's review of future water project
proposals. The construction of a new Delta water conveyance facility may or may not jeopardize the continued existence
of the delta smelt, and may or may not result in the destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat, depending
on numerous elements, including the facilities' design, location and operations criteria.

Comment 10:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters believed that implementation of EPA's water quality standards will only remedy one factor contributing
to the delta smelt's decline. Commenters suggested that over-fishing, habitat modification, and the introduction
of toxics and heavy metals to the Estuary have contributed to the decline of the delta smelt. Numerous respondents
stated that introduced species in the Delta, such as the yellowfin goby (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Acanthogobius flavimanus
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), striped bass and inland silversides are the real cause of the delta smelt's decline. Special concern was expressed
over the effects that two species of exotic zooplankton and a species of the exotic Asian clam, (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Potamocorbula amurensis
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) had on the Estuary ecosystem.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Regardless of other related effects, the best available information indicates that diminished water quality and
quantity are major factors contributing to the decline of the delta smelt. EPA's water quality (salinity) standards
will contribute to the recovery of the delta smelt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Act, the Service may list species and designate critical habitat even though the interaction of many causes
of the species' decline masks the relative contribution of any single factor. Critical habitat preserves options
for a species' recovery. As such, designation of critical habitat preserves habitat conditions within which implementation
of recovery actions can occur. As stated in the final rule to list the delta smelt, continuing studies may shed light
on the causes of decline, and lead to recovery or management actions that may be of benefit to the species.

Comment 11:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter was concerned that water users could comply with EPA's water quality standards early in the February-June
compliance period, hence adequate salinity would not be provided in later months if the delta smelt were to spawn late
in June or early July. The same commenter suggested that a year-round standard might be a better and more reasonable
approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Service generally agrees with this comment and recognized in the revised proposed rule that delta smelt may spawn
as late as July. Providing water quality (salinity) to conserve the delta smelt and its critical habitat is not limited
to a defined time period as EPA's standards are to the February through June period. As the ``Primary Constituent Elements''
section outlines, critical habitat for the delta smelt will be focused on the habitat needs of a particular life stage
that may be affected by a project. Additional flows may be required after the February through June period to protect
delta smelt present in the south and central Delta from being entrained in the State and Federal projects, and to avoid
jeopardy to the species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Though Grizzly Bay and lower Suisun Bay are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important areas of delta smelt habitat, habitat conditions elsewhere in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Suisun Bay and upstream in the Estuary are just as important for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing and adult migration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Habitat for each life stage is essential for the recovery of the species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and is contained in this designation.

Comment 13: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought additional flow requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not be needed in July or August to protect larval and juvenile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt from being entrained in the State and Federal water projects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
since delta smelt remain in particular locations despite flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service recognizes that juvenile and adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt, when given the opportunity, may remain in especially 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
productive areas such as Suisun Bay, after the mixing zone has moved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream. However, flows may be required in the July-August period to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protect delta smelt present in the south and central Delta from being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrained in the State and Federal projects, and to avoid jeopardy to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the species.

Comment 14: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One respondent noted that the distribution of delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt is not determined by flow alone. The commenter cited 1993 tow-net 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fall midwater trawl collections that found delta smelt upstream of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the mixing zone near Decker Island, and found delta smelt considerably 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downstream of the mixing zone in Suisun Bay. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service agrees that the distribution of delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt is not based exclusively on flow. When delta smelt are located in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitable, productive habitat, they may not travel with the mixing zone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as it moves upstream, or downstream. After being transported to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
productive rearing habitat, delta smelt may remain and take advantage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe and productive nursery areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta smelt do not become ``trapped'' in the mixing zone, but may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in particular areas. In the text of the final rule, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarifies this point by referring to the salt and freshwater mixing area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the ``mixing zone,'' rather than the ``entrapment zone,'' to clear any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
misconception that delta smelt and other estuarine species are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated exclusively or somehow become trapped within the vertical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circulation currents created by the saltwater-freshwater interface. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This type of circulation pattern is important because it mixes nutrients 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the ocean and inland areas, resulting in a productive estuarine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ecosystem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The pattern of delta smelt distribution described by the commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is consistent with distribution patterns in earlier years when dispersal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of delta smelt was greater following wetter springs (Sweetnam and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Stevens 1993). In 1993, about half the delta smelt population remained 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Suisun Bay throughout the summer, even though the 2 ppt isohaline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retreated upstream (Herbold 1994).

Comment 15: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter objected to the Service's use of EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed water quality standards as the factual and scientific basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delta smelt's critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has not based critical habitat for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delta smelt on EPA's water quality standards. Space requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for delta smelt population growth, cover, and shelter, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinity, were described in detail and were included as primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituent elements in the proposed rule to designate critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the delta smelt in 1991, well before EPA promulgated its proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards. Since 1991, the EPA and the Service have been working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
together to coordinate each agencies' actions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment 16: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Another commenter thought the Service simply identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the delta smelt's entire geographic range as critical habitat without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering whether the designation was essential to the conservation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the species. Other respondents believed the Service did not distinguish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between areas of critical habitat that are essential and nonessential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the conservation of the delta smelt, thereby including marginal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas not necessary for delta smelt recovery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service agrees that critical habitat is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited to the specific areas within the geographic area that contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the physical and biological features needed by the species. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed in more detail at comment 37, below, the Service has described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river, channel, slough and bay water habitats essential for the recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the smelt. Without these areas of habitat, the delta smelt cannot 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survive or reproduce, rear, or be transported between other suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the Act or its regulations requires the Service to rank or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify areas of habitat that are more ``essential'' than others when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat is designated. In the ``Primary Constituent Elements''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of this rule, the Service has specifically described the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
importance of habitat for each life stage of this annual species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Without adequate habitat for each of these life stages, the delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not survive or recover. The Service may highlight and propose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific management actions to protect and rehabilitate certain areas in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the recovery planning process, such as areas in Cache Slough and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lower Sacramento River complex identified by one commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Service did not simply designate critical habitat based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the entire geographic range of the delta smelt. At the time the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service expanded the critical habitat boundary in 1994, larval delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt had been located as far north as the confluence of the Sacramento 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
River with the Feather River. This area was not included in the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed critical habitat boundary. Based on recent unpublished data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(and brought to our attention in a comment), delta smelt in these most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upstream observations may have been misidentified as pond smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Hypomesus nipponensis, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or wakasagi). Portions of San Pablo Bay, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Napa River, and western Suisun Marsh known to support the species are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not included in the critical habitat designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, California Department of Fish and Game biologists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contacted the Service with new information that in 1993, delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were found spawning as far upstream as Sacramento. Based on this new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information and the importance of this spawning habitat in some years, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Service expanded critical habitat in the 1994 proposal to extend to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these important areas.

Designation of critical habitat for the delta

smelt is justified even though the 1992 and 1993 summer tow-net and fall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
midwater trawl abundance indices show increased abundance levels. Based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the best available information, the delta smelt has not recovered, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and remains vulnerable to a variety of threats. Delta smelt were listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as threatened because the species was likely to become an endangered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portion of its range. A species has recovered if the status of the

species, based on the best scientific and commercial data available,

indicates listing is no longer appropriate under the criteria of the Act

(50 CFR 402.02, 424.11(d)(2)). Listing remains appropriate under the

Act until long-term population abundance indices remain at high levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the population is widespread throughout the Estuary for a number of

years. One or two years of high abundance levels is not sufficient to

ensure recovery of an annual species such as the delta smelt. Specific

Several commenters were concerned with the Service's

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's water quality standards, having been based on eight estuarine

smelt recovery would be coordinated with the recovery of other

Designation of critical habitat and identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality (salinity) as a primary constituent element for protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the delta smelt may incidentally benefit other native estuarine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species. Providing variable salinity regimes will facilitate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery of the Estuary to its natural state. The Service does not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foresee a significant decline in other native estuarine species due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this critical habitat designation, or due to the implementation of EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water quality standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta smelt recovery will be coordinated with the habitat and water

quality needs of other fish and other marsh and wetland species in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Estuary. The Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team was formed in 1993 to

address the Estuary native fishes in general. The recovery team will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider the population decline of delta smelt and other native Estuary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fishes that ultimately may require active management to restore 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sustainable populations. The recovery team has developed a draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recovery Plan that has analyzed the needs and recommended management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions for the delta smelt, longfin smelt, Sacramento splittail, green 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sturgeon, spring-run chinook salmon, late fall-run chinook salmon and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
San Joaquin fall-run chinook salmon. Winter-run chinook salmon also was

One respondent commented that delta smelt spawn north 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Suisun Bay in Montezuma Slough, Suisun Slough and their tributaries, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and believed this fact contradicted the Service's assertion that delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt spawn upstream of the mixing zone.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Montezuma Slough, Suisun Slough, and their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tributaries are upstream of the area where mixing between freshwater and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salt water occurs in wetter water years. In dryer water years, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrapment zone may move upstream as far upstream as the City of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sacramento in late summer, and these sloughs may become saline. If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt were to spawn late (i.e., July or August), they would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probably seek areas other than the sloughs to spawn in freshwater.

Comment 22: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters at the public hearings suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the Service use hatcheries to produce enough delta smelt to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the population stable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service believes using hatcheries to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propagate fish, including delta smelt, should not be a substitute for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat protection and restoration. Dr. Moyle presented testimony in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1992 (Natural Heritage Institute 1992) summarizing the work of Hilborn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1992), which explained several reasons why hatcheries are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beneficial to the long-term maintenance of fisheries. His points 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included (1) though initially successful, hatchery effectiveness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decreases after a few years; (2) hatchery fish often do poorly in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wild; (3) artificial production poses a threat to the maintenance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wild fish; (4) hatchery fish dilute the naturally adapted genes of wild 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fish; and (5) hatcheries provide an excuse for habitat loss. Assuming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hatcheries could be used to stabilize delta smelt populations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
propagated fish would require an environment that provides ample food, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low levels of toxic compounds, and low entrainment losses (Moyle and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Herbold 1989). Reliance on hatcheries would not adhere to one of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
primary purposes of the Act, which is to conserve the ecosystem(s) upon 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which listed species depend (16 USC 1531(b)).

One commenter asked why the Service stated that delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt are more likely to be entrained in river channels than when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence, when there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no relationship between salvage and subsequent delta smelt abundance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter noted that entrainment also occurs in Pacific Gas and

Electric (PG &amp; E) cooling water diversions downstream from the

DWR (1994) states that Federal and State pumps 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entrain delta smelt. A relationship has been found between the number 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of juvenile delta smelt salvaged at the State and Federal pumps and both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the percent of inflow diverted and total Delta outflow (DWR 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whether or not there is a statistical relationship between the number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt entrained at the State and Federal water project pumps and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent delta smelt abundance, water quality (salinity) is essential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the conservation of the delta smelt. Adequate salinity and flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide the delta smelt with suitable habitat for all life stages, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will transport delta smelt away from major points of entrainment. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service recognizes and has stated in previous rules that delta smelt are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taken downstream of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River confluence in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numerous agricultural, municipal and industrial diversions. Delta smelt 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are also taken upstream from the confluence in numerous (over one-thousand) agricultural diversions.

One commenter thought the Montezuma Slough Control

delta smelt within Suisun Marsh.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the best available evidence, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintains that operation of the Montezuma Slough Control Structure may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service is required by section 4(b)(8) of the Act to identify public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or private activities that

may

 result in destruction or adverse

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Control Structure may provide valuable habitat to delta smelt, its

operation for other purposes may interfere with the distribution of

delta smelt to spawning and rearing habitat within Suisun Marsh. The

Some respondents believe humans are the real endangered

species, and that neither delta smelt nor any other animal species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be considered more important than humans. Similarly, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter thought humans could survive just fine without delta smelt, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
but could not survive without farmers.

The Act recognizes that species of fish, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wildlife, and plants are of aesthetic, ecological, educational, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
historical, recreational, and scientific value to the Nation and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
people (section 2(a)(3)). Delta smelt possess these attributes. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delta smelt is the only smelt endemic to California and one of only two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
native estuarine smelt species (the other being longfin smelt) found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Estuary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of the Act is to protect species in danger of becoming 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extinct in the immediate or foreseeable future. Humans are not in such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
danger. The number of humans has increased in the last century at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rapid rate. As pointed out in a report submitted by one commenter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total farm-related employment (agricultural services, food 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturers, and agricultural chemicals) increased between 1977 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1989 (Carter and Goldman 1992). Agricultural services provided 89,908 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jobs in California in 1989, adding some 45,000 jobs and more than 4,000

Congressman Gary Condit and several other commenters

As required by the Act, the Service has

Comment 27: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter was concerned that efforts by the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agencies to manage the Bay/Delta were uncoordinated. On the other hand, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one commenter presumed that the Service adopted EPA's water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards wholesale, and thought the Service had no authority to do so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the Service designates critical habitat under the narrow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purposes of the Act, while the EPA promulgates water quality standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the framework of the Clean Water Act. Similarly, another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter thought the Service would, in effect, be interposing or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substituting EPA's regulatory judgment for its own if the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated EPA's water quality standards in its designation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule does not incorporate EPA's water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality standards 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
per se
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, although implementation of these standards may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be a means to promote recovery of the delta smelt. The January 6, 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised critical habitat proposal for the delta smelt included a list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat conditions and a description of water quality primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituent elements. These elements were developed in accordance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the requirements of the Act and its regulations. The Service's proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also reflects the coordinated approach provided by the Club Fed process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service participated with the Bureau, NMFS, and EPA in guaranteeing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the January 6, 1994, critical habitat and water quality proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were based on the best available scientific and technical information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another priority was for the proposals to take into account the goals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and concerns of the agencies and public and private interests affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the agencies' programs and activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The preservation of rare and endangered species is a substantive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
link between the proposals of the Service and the EPA. The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
promulgated the Bay/Delta standards because they disapproved provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the 1991 Bay/Delta plan developed by the State Board. The EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that the State had not adopted criteria sufficient to protect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated uses of the Estuary, including the ``Preserv[ing] Rare and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Endangered Species'' designated use. Similarly, in discussing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Relationship Between Fish and Wildlife Service and EPA Actions,'' the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service wrote_``*&blank;*&blank;* [T]he Clean Water Act requires protection of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most sensitive use within each category of designated uses. `Protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Endangered and Threatened Species' is considered a designated use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the meaning of the Clean Water Act; therefore, a species listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Endangered Species Act provides one method to identify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
most sensitive use within the designated uses of a water body.'' (59 FR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
854). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Biologically, the proposed critical habitat for the delta smelt and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the salinity criteria that constituted EPA's proposed water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards are directly related. ``*&blank;*&blank;* EPA's proposed water quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards address the location of 2 ppt salinities from February to June 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, therefore, address both critical habitat requirements for delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt and a range of interrelated parameters that affect other species 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that rely on estuarine habitat.'' (59 FR 854) Based on the common legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and biological underpinnings of the critical habitat designation and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed water quality standards, the Service's treatment of salinity as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a primary constituent element and the textual references to the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
salinity standards were appropriate and fully consistent with the goal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of assuring substantive consistency between the two proposals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the designation of critical habitat and EPA's proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Bay/Delta standards have common elements, the critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation must address the standards, and, at a minimum, must not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inconsistent with them, and vice versa. The January 6, 1994, critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat proposal did not incorporate specific salinity standards into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the regulatory designation of habitat, as was the case with the initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat proposal published in 1991. Rather, the 1994 proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated water quality as a primary constituent element, stating_``salinity concentrations [as] required to
maintain delta smelt habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing, and adult 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
migration.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coordinated Federal effort and the substantive consistency of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the EPA and Service proposals are a direct reflection of the agencies' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intent to address Bay/Delta issues in an effective and responsible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner. The coordinated Club Fed process is intended to address 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns expressed by the State of California of a perceived lack of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coordination among the Federal agencies.

Comment 28: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought designation of critical habitat was not prudent at this time, since critical habitat would
not provide the delta smelt any more protection than the listing of the species had already provided. Another commenter
thought designating critical habitat at the present time would interfere with the delta smelt recovery planning
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Designation of critical habitat is prudent at this time because the designation will provide substantive benefits
to the delta smelt beyond those already resulting from its status as a threatened species. Critical habitat serves
to preserve options for a species' eventual recovery. A critical habitat designation contributes to species conservation
primarily by identifying important geographic areas, and by describing the features within the areas that are essential
to the species. The designation puts public and private entities on notice that the area is important habitat. Section
7 of the Act requires Federal agencies to ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to destroy
or adversely modify designated critical habitat. This section requires parties to consult with the Service to avoid
jeopardy and destruction or adverse modification to important habitat areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A designation of critical habitat provides a clearer indication to Federal agencies as to when consultation under
section 7 is required, particularly in cases where the action would not result in direct mortality or injury to individuals
of the listed species (e.g., an action occurring within the critical area when a migratory species is not present).
The critical habitat designation, describing the essential physical or biological features of the habitat, also
assists parties in determining which activities conducted outside the designated area are subject to section 7 consultation
(i.e., activities that may affect primary constituent elements of the designated area).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designating critical habitat also assists private, State, and Federal agencies in planning future actions, since
the designation establishes, in advance, those habitats that will be given special consideration in section 7 consultations
and section 10 incidental take activities. With the designation of critical habitat, potential conflicts between
projects and endangered or threatened species can be identified and possibly avoided early in the agency's planning
process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Designating critical habitat will not interfere with recovery planning efforts now in progress. A recovery plan
would be prepared for the delta smelt pursuant to the Act whether or not critical habitat was designated for the species.

Comment 29:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought Club Fed could not restore natural resources to levels existing during times of significantly
fewer people under current California law. Another respondent believed the Service may not refer to EPA's water quality
standards because the estuarine standards are based on historical conditions, rather than on ``existing conditions''
now occurring in the Estuary. The respondent claims there is a temporal element in the definition of critical habitat,
stating that critical habitat is defined in the Act in terms of existing conditions, and the Service must look to specific
areas which contain physical and biological features essential to the conservation of the species at the time it is
listed. The commenter went on to say that critical habitat may only consist of those areas that currently contain essential
physical and biological features.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definition of critical habitat does not require that all primary constituent elements necessarily be conditions
existing at the time critical habitat is designated. Conditions existing historically in the Estuary are required
to recover the delta smelt. Conditions now occurring in the Estuary have resulted in the decline of the delta smelt
population, because the Estuary currently does not contain all of the physical and biological features (e.g., habitat
requirements and salinity) necessary for each of the species' life stages. Critical habitat for the delta smelt identifies
areas needed to conserve the species, so it may recover and, ultimately, be delisted. In order to accomplish recovery,
it is necessary that critical habitat encompass conditions that are superior to existing conditions, so that all
of the physical and biological features necessary for the delta smelt are present in the Estuary. The Delta Native
Fishes Recovery Team has identified 1968 as a time when the Estuary had appropriate hydrologic conditions that would
allow recovery of the delta smelt. An interagency Statement of Principles (Plenert, Fullerton, and Seraydarian,

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1992) among the Service, NMFS and EPA have found that the Estuary ecosystem and its anadromous and resident fisheries
were relatively healthy during the years between 1960&hyph;1970. The Service recognizes no significant conflict
with managing toward historic conditions for all primary constituent elements as a conservation strategy for the
delta smelt.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service notes that the 1994 revised proposed critical habitat for the delta smelt contains the physical and biological
features essential for the conservation of the delta smelt. Using equations developed by Kimmerer and Monismith
(1992) to calculate salinity, DWR (1993) determined that the isohaline was located downstream of the Roe Island historic
reference point 124 days, and was between Roe Island and Chipps Island habitat 14 days between February 1 and June 31
in 1993 (DWR 1993). Therefore, conditions for spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing and adult migration
was, in fact, available for all life stages as recently as 1993. However, these physical and biological features do
not occur frequently enough, and are not protected during critical periods in February through June, especially
in drier water years. The mixing zone was pushed out beyond Roe Island during this period because 1993 was a wet year.
Water quality criteria are necessary to ensure habitat suitable for the delta smelt are available at critical times
in all water-year types.

A critical habitat designation need not, and should not, include specific management plans or recovery goals. Designating
critical habitat for a species does not result in a management or recovery plan. Critical habitat simply identifies
areas where conservation efforts should be concentrated. Designating critical habitat alone will not dictate how
the delta smelt should be protected, nor will it require identification of goals to measure the success of the designation.
Plans, goals, and directives will be identified and set in motion during the recovery planning process. Section 4(f)(1)
of the Act specifies what should be included in a recovery plan. Criteria for downlisting or delisting are contained
in recovery plans, which function as goals to achieve species conservation. The Delta Native Fishes Recovery Team
has developed a draft Recovery Plan for the delta smelt and other estuarine fish species, and will include recovery
and delisting criteria for the delta smelt. The public will have the opportunity to comment on a draft delta smelt Recovery
Plan before it is approved as a final plan as required by section 4(f)(4) of the Act.

Senator Phil Wyman and The California Farm Bureau were disappointed with the quality of the public hearings held in
Fresno because only the Service and the EPA attended the meeting to hear testimony and answer questions. The Senator
and the Farm Bureau believed the Bureau and NMFS should have been at the hearing, since the issues involved ``Club Fed''.
Moreover, several of the participants in Fresno felt the hearings were simply a ``going-through-the-motions''
exercise.

Section 4(b)(5)(E) of the Act requires the Service to hold a public hearing if one is requested within 45 days of the
publication of a proposed rule. The Service received such a request, and held hearings in Fresno, Irvine, Sacramento,
and San Francisco to accept public comment on two proposals by the Service and on one proposal by EPA_the proposed critical
habitat designation for the delta smelt, listing of the Sacramento splittail, and Bay/Delta water quality standards.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The hearings are not a ``going-through-the-motions'' event. Service staff review all oral comments presented at
the public hearings from the hearing transcripts. Oral comments are given the same weight and consideration as are
comments submitted in written form.

These commenters thought the Service should assess the environmental and social impacts that may occur in or near
the Estuary, and outside the Estuary area as a result of designating critical habitat for the delta smelt. Commenters
identified potential environmental impacts, including groundwater overdraft and subsequent land subsidence,
sagging canals and leaking rivers, fugitive dust, warming of reservoir water, impacts on regional water quality
control plans, increased energy use, impacts on listed and candidate species, loss of water for wetlands, loss of
open-space habitat provided by farms, and impacts on regional recreational use at reservoirs.

the Act, and is not legally required.

Comment 33:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thinks the Service violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) because it relied on scientific
information developed by the San Francisco Estuary Project (SFEP) in developing the revised critical habitat designation.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(2) of the Act specifies that ``The Secretary shall designate critical habitat *&blank;*&blank;* on
the basis of the best scientific data available *&blank;*&blank;*.'' When the Service identifies critical habitat,
it relies on scientific data in published literature, data gathered as a result of status reviews, data received during
the public comment periods, and information communicated in conversations with biologists, economists and other
specialists. A summary of the findings of the SFEP (1993) was included in the body of information that the Service used
to revise the proposed rule to designate critical habitat.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Critical habitat for the smelt was first proposed in October, 1991. The Service revised the critical habitat boundaries
in 1994, relying on the best scientific information available from California Department of Fish and Game biologists,
Service biologists, and new scientific information received during the public comment period from the EPA and other
commenters. Included in this information were the findings and recommendations of the SFEP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Had the Service not used SFEP information, the Service would not have complied with section 4(b)(2) of the Act, which
requires use of the best scientific evidence available. SFEP was created in 1988 as part of EPA's National Estuary
Program. The SFEP is an Environmental Management Program of EPA, the State of California and the Association of Bay
Area Governments. The Service has participated in the SFEP extensively over the past several years. The SFEP developed
recommendations for estuarine standards, and complied with FACA when they conducted workshops and meetings, and
when they chose participants to work on the standards.

Comment 34: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought the critical habitat designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is defective since the data supporting the expansion of critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the delta smelt was based on personal communications not available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the public review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service relied on information that has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available to the public by contacting the California Department of Fish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Game, EPA or the Service. The administrative record for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat designation is and has been available for public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection since publication of the initial proposed rule in 1991.

Comment 35: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter urged the Service and the EPA to exhaust 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all possible remedies to recover the delta smelt (e.g., by using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Delta Protection Act) before more burdens were placed on California's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water users with the designation of critical habitat.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 50 CFR 424.12, the Service must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designate critical habitat unless it is not prudent to do so. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service has not concluded that it is not prudent to designate critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat. Further, critical habitat is determinable. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement at section 4(b)(6)(c)(ii) to publish a final designation by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not more that one year after listing applies.

In this rulemaking, the Service first proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat for the delta smelt in 1991. It revised its proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in 1994 after public comment indicated that the Service had not included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important spawning habitat for the species. These facts are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly different from those of the case cited by the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As such, the Service does not apply the holding in that case to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking effort.

Comment 37:

Under sections 7 and 10 of the Act, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assesses the merits of project proposals on a case-by-case basis. In a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
formal section 7 consultation, the Service evaluates the effects of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action, creating an environmental baseline (50 CFR 402.14(g)(3)). This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline includes the past and present impacts of all Federal, State, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private actions and other human activities in the action area, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anticipated impacts of all proposed Federal projects in the action area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that have already undergone formal or early section 7 consultation, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the impact of State or private actions which are contemporaneous with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the consultation in process (50 CFR 402.02). Conservation actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed by project proponents can be considered as suitable measures to

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The economic analysis is described and its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results are summarized in this final rule. The Service believes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic analysis is sufficient in that it adequately and appropriately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifies costs of designating critical habitat. As such, it enables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Secretary to exclude areas from critical habitat designation if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benefits of an exclusion are found to outweigh the benefits of including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an area as critical habitat.

Comment 39: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters accused the Service of incorrectly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimizing the economic impacts in the delta smelt critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation since the impacts associated with the critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation were separated from the economic impacts attributable to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing of the species.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to consider the economic and other relevant impacts of designating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat. It does not direct the Service to assess the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of both listing the species and designating its critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat. Section 4(b)(1)(A) of the Act explicitly precludes the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from considering the economic impacts of listing a species as threatened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or endangered. The congressional intent behind inclusion of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statutory provision was to ensure that only relevant biological criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are used to assess the ecological status of a species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1994 revised proposed critical habitat designation for the delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt explained the economic impacts attributable to listing and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat designation. Subsequent to listing and prior to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final critical habitat designation, protective measures for the delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt (e.g., as provided through section 7 consultation with the Bureau) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been in place and created economic impacts not associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat designation. In a comprehensive economic analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared by the EPA and other economists for the Service, the economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts attributed to designating critical habitat have been evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has not limited the examination of economic impacts so as to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize the economic effects of designating critical habitat.

One commenter thought that the Service could not begin

to define critical habitat until it fully considered the economic

impacts of the designation. The commenter thought a proposed rule for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat could not be drafted until an economic analysis was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted, and an opportunity to comment on the analysis was provided to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interested parties. Another commenter thought the public should be able 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to comment on a revised critical habitat designation in the event the

Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has not defined critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prematurely for the delta smelt because the Act does not require 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
completion of an economic analysis before the Service can propose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat areas. In a critical habitat rulemaking conducted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the Act and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service defines and proposes critical habitat boundaries, conducts an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact analysis, takes public comment on the proposed critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat designation and the economic analysis, makes exclusions, if any, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to critical habitat boundaries, and promulgates a final rule. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary, through the Service, has the discretion to exclude critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat areas based on economics, in accordance with the section 4(b)(2) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard. The section allows the Secretary to exclude any area from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat, provided that exclusion will not result in extinction of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species. The Service has properly conducted critical habitat rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the delta smelt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Neither the Act, nor its regulations, require the Service to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment on revised critical habitat designations where the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Secretary has excluded areas of proposed critical habitat. The standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking process requires preparation of a proposed rule followed by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule. Publishing a draft final rule is not required. The Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acknowledges that the public was allowed to comment in the above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described manner in the critical habitat designation for the Northern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spotted Owl, however, the opportunity for public comment was a policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decision made specifically for that rulemaking and is not required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has provided ample opportunity for the public to comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the delta smelt critical habitat designation proposals and on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic analysis during prescribed comment periods from October 3 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
February 3, 1992; March 16 to April 30, 1993, and again from January 27 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

comments on the revised proposed critical habitat designation.

Comment 41: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter thought the critical habitat designation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was flawed since the economic analysis could not properly analyze 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impacts likely to arise from the proposed designation, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Service failed to present any focused or concrete indication of what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific management measures would be pursued. The commenter thought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the public was not able to effectively comment on the critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation due to this inadequacy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Designating critical habitat does not result in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management plan. Specific management measures are identified in a draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Recovery Plan that currently is being prepared by the Service, and need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be identified in a proposed critical habitat designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in the above comment, the Service believes the public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was given an opportunity to effectively comment on the critical habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation and the draft economic analysis. The draft RIA was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is deficient because the Service failed to analyze the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impacts of any particular portion of the Delta.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4 of the Act requires the Secretary to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
take into consideration ``The economic impact *&blank;*&blank;* of specifying any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular area as critical habitat.'' The Service may exclude any area 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from critical habitat if it is determined that the benefits of such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exclusion outweigh the benefits of specifying such areas as part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
critical habitat, unless failure to designate such area will result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the extinction of the species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service believes it has adequately analyzed the potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impacts of the Estuary ``area.'' The Act does not require an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agency to analyze potential economic impacts for any specific or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particular ``area.'' An ``area'' is not limited to particular reaches of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
river, or particular areas of a species' habitat.

Comment 43: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Army thought the Service did not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficiently analyze the economic impacts of designating critical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
habitat, and did not include adequate economic data. They thought the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Service should have included channel dredging activities and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance of flood control levees in the economic analysis, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the economic impacts of potential failure and flooding since maintenance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
might be limited due to critical habitat designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Service Response: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service believes the economic impacts of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designating critical habitat have been sufficiently addressed, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include discussion of dredging and levee maintenance. As discussed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the final rule to list the delta smelt, and in the revised proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to designate critical habitat for the species, the Service determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the economic impact of restricting activities associated with deep 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water navigation channel dredging were attributable to the jeopardy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standard imposed by the listing of the delta smelt as a threatened 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species. Hence, the economic impacts of these activities can not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with designating critical habitat. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service did determine that levee maintenance may adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modify critical habitat without necessarily jeopardizing the delta 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
smelt. The economic impacts of restrictions associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction and implementation of these projects have been analyzed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the economic cost or benefit of critical habitat designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Properly scheduling maintenance and construction activities to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periods critical to a species can allow projects to go forward without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incurring large economic impacts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment and/or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an Environmental Impact Statement, as defined under the authority of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not be prepared in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a) of the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A notice outlining the Service's reasons for this determination was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of the Interior has determined that the proposed rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Based on the information discussed in this rule, significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impacts will not result from the critical habitat designation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, no direct costs, enforcement costs, information collection, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping requirements are imposed on small entities by this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designation. Further, the rule contains no recordkeeping requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Service has analyzed the potential takings implications of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designating critical habitat for the delta smelt in a Takings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Implications Assessment prepared pursuant to requirements of Executive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Order 12630, ``Governmental Actions and Interference with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Constitutionally Protected Property Rights.'' The Takings Implications 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment concludes that the designation does not pose significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takings implications.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 NMFS transfers 5&blank;metric tons (mt) of bluefin tuna from the longline-south Incidental subcategory to the longline-north
Incidental subcategory. NMFS has determined that the fisheries landing bluefin under the longline-south Incidental
subcategory will not achieve the full 1994 quota allocation. This action is being taken to extend the season for the
longline-north Incidental subcategory, which will assure additional collection of biological assessment and
monitoring data and increase the economic benefits from this fishery without contributing significantly to additional
bluefin mortality. In addition, this action will prevent waste of bluefin tuna that might otherwise be discarded
dead.

 Bluefin tuna are currently leaving the fall feeding grounds in New England and migrating along the Mid-Atlantic waters,

<!-- PJG 0253 grid5678 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 N. lat. Once the quota is reached for this northern subcategory, any bluefin tuna incidentally taken by longline vessels
must be discarded at sea. In order to prevent waste of bluefin tuna, which would otherwise be discarded dead, NMFS is
transferring an additional 5 mt of quota from the southern to the northern subcategory. With the addition of this 5
mt, the total annual allocation to date for the Incidental subcategory longline-north will be 33 mt. This amount should
be sufficient to account for incidental take of bluefin by the northern subcategory for the remainder of this year
while any unharvested balance for the southern subcategory will be added to the 1995 quota. After the transfer of this
5 mt, approximately 12 mt remains available in the longline-south Incidental subcategory. Based on reported catches,
bluefin taken from the southern subcategory will not exceed the 12 mt remaining of that quota.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule replaces the Interim Rule dated April 26, 1991, and implements the provisions of section 6 of the Real
Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA). Most recently, the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement
Act of 1994 provides alternate methods for disclosure of mortgage servicing history. Section 6 also sets forth procedures
regarding the transfer of mortgage servicing for any federally related mortgage loan, as defined in section 3 of RESPA
and the definition is refined in the implementing regulation for RESPA and 24 CFR 3500.2. Although RESPA was extended
by section 908 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 to subordinate liens, in this rule the Secretary
has exempted from RESPA's mortgage servicing coverage all federally related mortgage loans that are not secured
by a first lien. In addition, the Department has adopted conforming amendments to 24 CFR part 203, the FHA Single Family
Mortgage Insurance program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department is also publishing a conforming amendment to its final rule on escrow accounting procedures, published
on October 26, 1994 (59 FR 53890). This amendment will update a cross-reference in another section of part 3500 that
references enforcement of escrow accounting provisions.

Justification for Final Rulemaking_Part 203 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In general, the Department publishes a rule for public comment before issuing a rule for effect, in accordance with
its own regulations on rulemaking, 24 CFR part 10. However, part 10 does provide for exceptions from that general rule
where the agency finds good cause to omit advance notice and public participation. The good cause requirement is satisfied
when prior public procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.'' (24 CFR 10.1)
The Department finds that good cause exists to publish for effect without first soliciting public comment the sections
of this rule that pertain to 24 CFR part 203, and that prior public procedure is unnecessary because those portions
of this rule merely conform part 203 to the provisions of Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974
(12 U.S.C. 2605) that have been developed through notice and comment rulemaking.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 941 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, approved November
28, 1990) amended the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, 12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq. (RESPA), by adding a new
section 6, which addresses mortgage servicing requirements (i.e., the right to collect mortgage payments for principal,
interest, and any escrow account items). Section 6 (12 U.S.C. 2605) requires disclosure to certain mortgage loan
applicants of historical data regarding the transfer of mortgage servicing, as well as estimates regarding the potential
transfer of servicing pertaining to the applicant's mortgage loan and other mortgage loans. Section 6 was further
amended on April 10, 1991, by Dire Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;27), to create a transition
period during which lenders and servicers would not be liable for violations of the Act. This amendment also directed
HUD to publish implementing regulations effective no later than April 20, 1991. On April 26, 1991, the Department
published an Interim Rule implementing Section 6 (56 FR 19505). That rule remains in effect until it is replaced by
this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6 requires that, at the time of application for federally related mortgage loans, applicants be given information
in a disclosure statement (hereafter called ``Servicing Disclosure Statement'') concerning the likelihood that
the servicing of their mortgage may be transferred and information regarding the history of mortgage servicing transfers
of the person making the loan. Section 6 sets forth additional notice requirements at the time of a servicing transfer
(hereafter called ``Notice of Transfer'') and other rights for borrowers, and provides for the collection of damages
and costs by borrowers from servicers for noncompliance. Finally, section 6 preempts any State law or regulation
regarding notice to borrowers at the time of application or servicing transfer, as long as the lender or servicer complies
with the relevant provisions of section 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD originally complied with the requirements to promulgate a model disclosure statement and applicant's acknowledgement
by publication of a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on March 20, 1991 (56 FR 11886). These requirements were restated in an Interim Rule of April 26, 1991 (56 FR 19505).
HUD encourages persons covered by this new rule to implement its provisions earlier than its effective date. (The
Department also recently published a related rule on escrow accounting procedures under section 10 of RESPA (59 FR
53890, October 26, 1994).

Comments on Interim Rule and Responses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the interim rule the Department requested comments on the provisions of the rule. The following is a summary of comments
received and HUD's position on the issues in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Business day.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There were two comments about the definition of ``business day.'' Both recommended that the definition be put in &sect;3500.2,
so that it would apply to the entire regulation, and that it be the same definition in Regulation X and Regulation Z (Truth
in Lending). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The current RESPA rule defines a ``business day'' utilizing language conforming with the definition in Regulation
Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act. Section 6 of RESPA does not specifically define ``business day'', but
in certain provisions excludes public holidays, Saturdays, and Sundays from references to ``days''. To assure uniform
statutory construction, as well as to continue uniformity with related Federal regulatory statutes, the Department
is applying the ``business day'' definition of the Regulation X in this rule. Therefore, business day means a day on
which the offices of the business entity are open to the public for carrying on substantially all of the entity's business
functions. If a day is not specified as a business day in this rule, the reference is to a calendar day.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Effective date of transfer.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 There were three comments on this definition. One commenter approved of the definition because the date was pinpointed.
Another commenter disagreed and considered the date indefinite, particularly as it relates to delinquent mortgages.
The third thought the effective date of transfer should be the date the contract between the parties states that the
transfer takes place.

HUD response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The term ``effective date of transfer'' is defined in Section 6 of the Act as the date on which the mortgage payment of
a borrower is first due to the transferee servicer (new servicer) pursuant to the assignment, sale, or transfer of
the servicing of the mortgage loan. The statute controls and HUD does not have discretion to consider the suggested
alternatives.

Mortgage servicing loan.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department received several comments regarding the extent and limitations of coverage under this rule. The term
``federally related mortgage loan'' was the starting point for delineating coverage and is defined in &sect;3500.2,
subject to the exemptions in &sect;3500.5. Pursuant to section 19(a) of RESPA, at this time the Secretary has exempted
from the requirements of this rule any subordinate lien federally related mortgage loans and has excluded all open-end
lines of credit (home equity plans), whether secured by a first or subordinate lien, that are covered under the Truth
in Lending Act and Regulation Z. The penalty provisions of the Truth in Lending Act are similar to those of Section 6
of RESPA, and the error resolution section of Regulation Z (12 CFR 226.13) provides protections similar to Section
6 of RESPA. Any other federally related mortgage loan secured by a first lien and not exempted under &sect;3500.5,
is covered by these requirements and called a ``mortgage servicing loan.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters asked for definitions of additional terms. One commenter suggested that ``loans made'' be distinguished
from ``loans originated'', and that ``servicing transfer'' be defined.

HUD response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The terms ``loans made'' and ``loans originated'' are synonymous, but the Department agrees that consistent use
of terminology would avoid confusion and, therefore, has eliminated the term ``loans made.'' HUD considers a ``servicing
transfer'' to be a sale, assignment, or transfer of servicing to a person or legal entity other than the maker of the
loan named in the legal documents. Also, as discussed more fully later in this preamble, a servicing transfer occurs
as part of a table-funding (defined in &sect;3500.2) between the mortgage broker, as transferor, and the funding
lender, as transferee.

Refinancing Transactions

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department received 18 comments relating to refinancing transactions. Seven commenters recommended that refinancing
be defined. Three commenters questioned the statutory authority for covering refinancing transactions. Since
HUD received these comments, the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 amended RESPA to state specifically
that refinancing transactions are covered. A definition of refinancing was added to part 3500 in revisions published
on February 10, 1994 (59 FR 6505, concerning subordinate liens), and is applicable to this section. The impact of this
definition is that transactions specifically excluded from the definition of refinancing do not require new disclosures.

Questions Involving State Law Preemption
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asked about the effect of Section 6 on State laws. While Section 18 of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2616) sets forth
general provisions regarding preemption, Section 6 contains its own preemption provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that one of the significant achievements of Section 6 was the elimination of perceived difficulties
in the marketing of servicing rights for mortgage loans originated in various States. In part, Section 6 constituted
a recognition of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de facto
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 national market for mortgages and mortgage servicing and represented an attempt to facilitate such a market by establishing
uniform standards. Therefore, Section 6 is determinative of the information required for the Servicing Disclosure
Statement and the Notice(s) of Transfer; any other similar State requirements are preempted. Other provisions of
State laws, such as those requiring additional notices to insurance companies or taxing authorities are not preempted
by Section 6 or this rule. If permitted under State law, such additional information may be added to a notice prepared
under this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Requests for Exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Nine commenters requested that their institutions be exempted from providing Servicing Disclosure Statements,
either because they were not institutions that transferred servicing or because they were chartered to make certain
public purpose loans. Another commenter wanted an exemption for lenders that always transfer loans at closing; three
commenters requested an exemption for lenders that do not sell the servicing rights. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 While the Secretary has the authority to create classes of exemptions under Section 19 of RESPA, no commenter advanced
a reason that would justify an exempted class. The Servicing Disclosure Statement is particularly appropriate when
a lender always transfers loans at closing. When a servicer never sells servicing rights, it can simply state that
fact. In any event, the information relating to complaint resolution must be provided, although lenders that do not
transfer servicing may incorporate this information into the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A. HUD amended the Servicing
Disclosure Statement to include a sentence in the heading suggesting that a borrower save the statement if a loan is
approved and to include alternate language regarding the history of mortgage servicing transfers that is allowed
under the 1994 amendments of Section 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In the event a lender changes its policy and begins to sell the servicing, a commenter suggested that these lenders
have to follow the rule within six months after beginning sale of servicing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When a lender determines that it will sell servicing, the lender will be subject to the requirement that it furnish
to the borrower a 15-day Notice of Transfer. The lender may also be required to revise its Servicing Disclosure Statement
at the next calendar year revision. There is no obligation to send an amended Servicing Disclosure Statement for previously
closed loans at the time of the sale of servicing; the 15-day Notice of Transfer provides the required information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Three commenters suggested that mortgage brokers should be exempt from furnishing the Servicing Disclosure
Statement, because furnishing the Statement is the obligation of the funding lender. However, another commenter
suggested that a face-to-face meeting with the mortgage broker should satisfy the face-to-face meeting requirement
for a lender. Two other commenters stated that the time (3 business days) should begin to run after the lender receives
the written application from another party. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The general rule is that the Servicing Disclosure Statement shall be provided within 3 days of receipt of the borrower's
written loan application, unless the application for credit is turned down within that time. If an application is
received by a mortgage broker that will close the loan in its own name using table funding, the table funding mortgage
broker is to provide the Servicing Disclosure Statement, using the ``we do not service mortgage loans'' optional
language in &sect;3500.21(b)(4). Similarly, for first-lien dealer loans, the dealer should provide the Servicing
Disclosure Statement, using the ``we do not service mortgage loans'' optional language. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A commenter questioned whether a Servicing Disclosure Statement is required when the mortgage servicing function
is transferred to an affiliated entity. A question was also posited as to how to treat a circumstance when a lender had
a program that always sold servicing and another where no servicing was required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A Notice of Transfer generally is required when there is a transfer of servicing between or to affiliates, unless there
are no substantial changes in the way the borrower makes payments (see discussion below). However, the information
regarding affiliate or subsidiary transfers is not required to be included in the statistical computations found
in the Servicing Disclosure Statement. In the interest of full disclosure, this information may be provided voluntarily;
the model format allows for this disclosure. If the lender is providing the historical data, the lender should indicate
whether the Servicing Disclosure Statement includes assignments, sales or transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries.
When the lender has a variety of programs, some of which sell servicing and some of which do not, information may be added
to the model format to allow the servicer to describe this situation, or some variation of this situation. Further,
while the use of the acknowledgment is mandatory, the use of the model format is not, and the incorporation in a footnote
or otherwise of reasonable additional information, to describe situations that do not fit conveniently into the
format is anticipated and expected. Sample language describing other alternative situations has been included
with the model format.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Several commenters discussed proposed variations to the Servicing Disclosure Statement. These variations
included permitting a lender to: (i) state its reasons for servicing or not servicing loans; (ii) identify the types
of loans it services and, by the percentages of each type of loan transferred, the types of loans it sells; and (iii)
advise the borrower of the new servicer, if any, at settlement. One commenter suggested that &sect;3500.21(c) contain
a statement that the use of the sample language in the appendices be considered as compliance with the disclosure requirements
of that paragraph. Fifteen commenters recommended that lenders should not be required to obtain written acknowledgements
of the Servicing Disclosure Statement from loan applicants whose applications are rejected or withdrawn. One commenter
recommended that actual percentages be used rather than rounding to the nearest quartile. Commenters also requested
that HUD permit longer than 31 days to calculate the percentage after the end of the calendar year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The elements contained in the rule and Servicing Disclosure Statement comply with the Secretary's mandate under
Section 6 of RESPA. The Secretary is required to develop a disclosure statement that would notify applicants for federally
related mortgage loans about the servicing procedures, transfer practices and requirements, and the available
complaint resolution process. In addition, the Secretary must develop an acknowledgement that the disclosure has
been read and understood, as evidenced by signatures of the applicants when such a statement appears in the application.
As in the interim rule, the Secretary has determined that is in the applicant's best interest for the signature to be
at the end of the Servicing Disclosure Statement, because this directs the applicant's attention particularly to
the servicing transfer issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the precise wording of the Servicing Disclosure Statement is left to the lender's discretion, HUD presumes
that lenders will use the sample language in developing their own forms. However, HUD will not give blanket approval
to forms that it has not seen; the lender must determine the appropriate language to make proper disclosure to the borrower.
Only the language in the model Applicant's Acknowledgement is mandatory and must be followed precisely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Even though the Department believes that most lenders will use the simpler alternative language allowed by the Riegle
Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;325, approved September 23, 1994),
the Department has adopted the suggestion of permitting a longer time for computation of the previous year's percentages.
The final rule allows the lender to calculate the percentages no later than the end of the first quartile in the next
calendar year (March 31). Under his Section 19 authority, the Secretary has also created an exemption to the disclosure
requirement, including the signed acknowledgment, if an applicant is turned down for credit within three business
days of receipt of the application. This exemption makes all the mortgage servicing notice provisions consistent
with good faith estimate amendments in section 951 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Several commenters asked various questions as to what disclosures were necessary when a servicer buys another
servicer, with or without changing the servicer's name, or merges one servicer into another servicer. In addition,
two comments concerned the functions of ``master servicers'' and ``subservicers.'' The entity holding servicing
rights is frequently called the ``master servicer,'' and the entity performing the actual servicing is called the
``subservicer''. Two situations were posited: first, the rights to servicing are sold, but the subservicer remains
the same. Second, the subservicer changes, but the master servicer remains the same. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The controlling consideration in whether a Notice of Transfer must be delivered for a sale, transfer, or assignment
is whether there is a significant change of servicing that potentially affects the borrower. In ordinary transfers
of servicing between distinct entities, the Notice of Transfer is always required. In certain other situations_e.g.,
transfers between affiliates, transfers because a servicer or subservicer is bought or merged into another entity,
and transfers between master servicers when the subservicer stays the same and when the subservicer changes_a Notice
of Transfer is required unless there is no change in the payee, the collection address, account number, or the amount
of the payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Six commenters suggested that when there are multiple applicants, it should be sufficient for the lender to give
the Servicing Disclosure Statement to one of the co-applicants in a face-to-face interview. One commenter requested
that a co-signer not be considered as a person who applies for a loan, therefore obviating the need for the co-signer
to receive a Servicing Disclosure Statement. Another commenter asked how long a lender must keep co-signers' signatures
on file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Delivery of a single Servicing Disclosure Statement in a face-to-face meeting with one or more applicants is acceptable,
and the Acknowledgement may be signed at that time. For each applicant or co-applicant who is not present, the Servicing
Disclosure Statement may be delivered on his or her behalf to an applicant who is present, or may be mailed within 3 business
days by first class mail, postage prepaid. While a co-signer might be an integral party to the transaction, a co-signer
is primarily interested in timely payments of the mortgage, not in who holds the mortgage servicing. Therefore, a
co-signer's acknowledgment is not required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The signed acknowledgments are to be in the loan package. Consistent with other record-retention requirements of
part 3500, the lender must keep the signed acknowledgments for five years after the date of settlement of the loan unless
the lender disposes of its interest in the loan and does not service the mortgage. In this case, the Servicing Disclosure
Statement would be part of the transferred loan file.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(3) One comment suggested that requiring prepaid, first-class postage for a Servicing Disclosure Statement that
is mailed is unnecessary, costly, and inconsistent with the disclosure mailed in compliance with the Truth in Lending
and Equal Credit Opportunity Acts. If the transaction is handled by mail, one commenter suggested, the period of three
business days should begin only after the lender receives a written application from the borrower. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of prepaid, first-class mail is common business practice. The practice reasonably assures that the borrower
will receive the Servicing Disclosure Statement and, thus, affords protection to those responsible for delivering
the statement. The 3-business day period begins only when the application is received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Four commenters suggested that lenders be permitted to include in the Servicing Disclosure Statement a statement
that ``the loan cannot be funded unless the acknowledgements are signed and returned.'' One commenter asked that
no follow-up correspondence be required if the lender has provided the Servicing Disclosure Statement to the borrower
and the borrower has not returned a signed Acknowledgement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department has deleted in this final rule the provision that no loan should be funded unless the signed Acknowledgement
was contained in the loan package. HUD has determined that there is sufficient oversight by regulators and secondary
market purchasers, and no overriding reason to highlight the Servicing Disclosure Statement over any other required
statement. However, the Acknowledgement is still required to be a part of the loan package. The Department has also
eliminated the mandatory follow-up requirement that was included in the interim rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) One commenter stated that if the servicing is always sold, transferred, or assigned, there is not a ``present servicer''
or a ``new servicer'' at the time of application for the loan. The model language of the Notice of Transfer indicates
that the borrower will be informed about the servicer, but the language fails to state when and in what format the borrower
will receive this information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department disagrees with the content of this comment. Whoever sells, transfers, or assigns a federally related
mortgage loan is considered the present servicer and is called the ``transferor servicer'' in this rule. The servicer
that buys, is transferred, or is assigned the mortgage servicing function is the new servicer and is called the ``transferee
servicer.'' A mortgage broker that closes a table-funded transaction in its own name is in the position of a transferor
servicer. A dealer in a first lien dealer loan situation is also a transferor servicer. Appendix B of the interim rule
presented sample language for the Notice of Transfer; the language is retained in substantial degree in this final
rule. As with the Servicing Disclosure Statement, discretion is allowed concerning the exact wording of the Notice
of Transfer, but the various elements that the notice must contain are detailed in &sect;3500.21(e). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Two commenters requested clarification about who bears the primary responsibility for notifying the borrower
of a transfer of servicing when the transferor and transferee choose to notify the borrower in a single, joint Notice
of Transfer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD believes that in normal business transactions, the timing and issuance of Notices of Transfer would be resolved
as part of the purchase and sale agreement. If a joint notice is not feasible, both notices will be required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Several commenters were concerned about the impact of the requirements on the servicer's ability to administer
collection practices consistent with investor requirements. A commenter questioned whether a late payment could
be assessed prior to the 60-day period if the payment had not been made to the transferee. Also, two commenters asked
whether late fees due prior to the transfer could be assessed.

If within the 60-day period the borrower has mistakenly mailed a payment to the transferor instead of the transferee,
a late fee may not be imposed. However, if neither the transferor nor the transferee has received a regularly scheduled
payment within the 60-day period, or any longer applicable grace period, late payment charges may be assessed in accordance
with the servicer's established practices. Late charges due from the borrower before the effective date of transfer
of servicing are not covered by RESPA or this rule.

Questions Relating To Qualified Written Requests
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) Two comments addressed the type of information that HUD permits a borrower to include in a ``qualified written
request.'' One commenter wished to limit the requirements to those inquiries asserting errors that have been caused
by the transfer of servicing on a mortgage account. The other commenter wanted clarification on whether the requirements
were limited to inquiries on payments and account balances. Another question concerned the length of time a servicer
has to respond to qualified written requests after a loan is paid off or after servicing has been transferred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The statute encompasses all information relating to the servicing of a mortgage loan and does not restrict the subject
matter to questions concerning the transfer of servicing, installment payments, or account balances. For example,
a written inquiry concerning a collection for or disbursement from an escrow account would be a qualified written
request if the correspondence contains the required identifying elements. In &sect;3500.21(f)(2), the Department
establishes a 1-year period in which a qualified written request is valid after the date of loan pay-off or mortgage
servicing transfer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Three commenters were concerned about how written requests were received. One said that the regulations should
state that ``a qualified written request'' must be mailed to an address supplied by the servicer in the coupon book
or written correspondence and not the address for the mortgage payment. Another wanted to disregard requests that
lacked the account number or were attached to the borrower's check, as distinguished from being placed in the same
envelope. The third suggested that the regulations should specifically disqualify written inquiries that the borrower
includes with the loan payment. A commenter suggested that the Department require a servicer to provide to the borrower
information identifying the name and telephone number of a representative or the office or department of the servicer
through which the borrower will receive assistance after submitting a qualified written request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) This rule does not require that a servicer establish an office to handle borrowers' complaints. It does, however,
allow the servicer to do so. In the event the servicer establishes such an office and complies with all the necessary
notice provisions of this rule, then the borrower must deliver its request to that office in order for the inquiry to
be a ``qualified written request'' (see the optional language in Appendix MS&hyph;2 to part 3500).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the servicer determines that a borrower's correspondence does not constitute a qualified written request
(the most likely disqualification would be writing the inquiry on the payment coupon), the servicer should retain
sufficient information to support its determination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A commenter sought clarification of when the Department considers an inquiry to be resolved.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

An inquiry is resolved when the servicer supplies the requested information or corrects an error. See, for example,
Regulation Z, 12 U.S.C. 226.13(e) and (f) for similar complaint resolution provisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Eight commenters discussed the protection of the borrower's credit rating during a dispute. Most commenters
asked whether a lender could provide payment information to a consumer reporting agency prior to the end of the 60-business
day period if the dispute was resolved. Two commenters noted that a servicer would be in an unfair position if the servicer
has previously reported a borrower's loan as past due and then is not allowed to report the payment. The commenters
suggested that the servicer be permitted to advise the credit agency that the servicer is prohibited by law from providing
additional information at that time. As a benefit to the borrower, one comment suggested that the servicer be allowed
to report prior to the 60-business day period to clear a borrower's record. One commenter raised a question about whether
a lender should assume that a third party is acting as the borrower's agent, or should require proof from the borrower
of this delegation of authority. Furthermore, the commenter asked if the 20-business day time-frame, in which the
borrower must receive a written acknowledgement from the servicer, is calculated from when the request is received
or when the servicer confirms that the third party is the borrower's agent.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD interprets the statute to mean that no adverse information relating to a borrower's overdue payment information
may be provided to a credit reporting agency within the 60-day period after the servicing function is transferred,
assigned, or sold or after the servicer receives a qualified written request for information. The statute is implemented
by this rule in a manner that does not prohibit a servicer from reporting an improvement (such as a payment found or received)
in the borrower's record within the 60 day period. It is the servicer's responsibility to determine whether it has
sufficient information that a third party is acting as the borrower's agent or the borrower should verify the agent's
representative capacity. When the servicer is in doubt as to the status of the third party, the written acknowledgement
can also be mailed to the borrower to ask that the borrower verify the status of the third party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) One comment asked for clarification of whether the servicer was prohibited from reporting delinquencies unrelated
to a dispute.

HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A servicer may report a delinquency to a credit reporting agency provided that the report does not concern a pending
qualified written request, which questions the correctness of the account, or a loan payment sent by the borrower
to the transferor, rather than the transferee, within 60 days after the servicing of the loan is transferred.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) One commenter hypothesized a situation in which a borrower sends a qualified request in September concerning
a late charge assessed on the March payment, yet the borrower has not made his April through August payments. Is the
servicer prohibited from reporting these delinquencies in September, although they are unrelated to the March dispute?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD position. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The receipt of a qualified written request by the servicer determines when the 60-business day period begins. If the
April through August delinquencies are caused by the problem or issue identified by the borrower in the request, adverse
information related to all of these delinquencies may not be submitted or resubmitted, if previously reported. In
this instance, the 60-business day period begins when the qualified written request is received in September. However,
there is nothing in RESPA that prohibits the servicer from initiating foreclosure action, or taking other remedial
actions under the applicable mortgage documents, against the mortgaged property based on the delinquent payments
in March through August. The servicer's timing on initiating foreclosure action is governed by the provisions of
the borrower's mortgage document.

Servicing Involving Certain Government-Related Agencies or Enterprises
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6 provides that certain government or government-sponsored entities that have oversight or other relationships
with servicers are not themselves servicers for purposes of Section 6. These entities include the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) in connection with assets acquired, assigned,
sold, or transferred pursuant to section 13(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or as receiver or conservator
of an insured depository institution. Section 6 also makes provisions for certain circumstances involving mortgage
servicing loans when government or government-sponsored entities have to deal with the termination for cause of
the contract for servicing a loan or with the commencement of proceedings for bankruptcy of the servicer in a program
involving such entity. In addition, in giving the transfer notice the statute also allows a delay of up to 30 days after
the transfer of servicing. HUD believes that Congress exempted these entities from most mortgage servicing transfer
requirements so as not to interfere with the fiduciary responsibilities of the entities with regard to protective
actions needed to be taken by such entities, and not to create for such governmental entities potential liability
that could inhibit the orderly transfer of servicing. Also, imposition of standard business requirements in troubled
situations involving a fiduciary could adversely affect the underlying value of the related mortgage servicing.
Because the rationales discussed above apply equally well to other Federal entities not specifically enumerated
in Section 6(i)(2) of the Act, the Secretary has exercised his authority under Section 19(a) of RESPA and has added
certain other Federal agencies (HUD, including FHA; VA; NCUA; and FmHA) that might also be in a fiduciary position
or need to protect a borrower in an otherwise covered mortgage loan situation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, under Section 19 the Secretary has exempted FHA from having to provide the Notice of Transfer in those
instances where the mortgage has been assigned (along with the servicing) to FHA for the payment of the mortgage insurance
benefits pursuant to section 230 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715u). Under the assignment program, the
mortgagor actively provides information to both the mortgagee and FHA in order to show that the mortgagor meets certain
eligibility criteria. The assignment of the mortgage to FHA is not a business decision. Rather, it is a means by which
eligible mortgagors can avoid foreclosure and keep their homes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mortgagors are aware early on in the process that, if deemed eligible, HUD will become their mortgagee and servicer.
HUD also accepts assignment of other single-family insured mortgage loans under certain specialty programs. These
assignments are not comparable to the normal sale and purchase transactions that the mortgage servicing transfer
provisions of Section 6 were designed to address. Thus, requiring HUD to provide the notice of transfer in cases where
mortgages are assigned to HUD would not serve the purposes of Section 6, and these assignments have been exempted under
the Secretary's authority in Section 19.

Damages and Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) The statute provides that whoever fails to comply with any provision of Section 6 shall be liable to the borrower.
These damages include actual damages and, in an action brought by an individual, up to $1,000 for a pattern of noncompliance;
in a class action, the additional damages may not exceed the lesser of $500,000 or 1% of the servicer's net worth.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A commenter noted that ``actual damages'' should be clarified. If a servicer reported a debt to a credit bureau within
the 60-business day proscribed period, and the borrower alleges that the reporting resulted in the borrower's inability
to obtain credit, the servicer could be liable for damages, even if the report was correct. Therefore, the commenter
suggested that to prove actual damages the borrower must show:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The servicer made the report to a credit company within the proscribed period;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The borrower was correct, the dispute was resolved in the borrower's favor; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The borrower would have otherwise been approved for the credit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD position. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a servicer violates &sect;3500.21(g) by reporting information on a borrower to a credit agency relating to a dispute
regarding the borrower's payments within 60 business days of receiving a qualified written inquiry from the borrower,
that servicer will be liable for all proven actual damages that the borrower suffered because of the servicer's action.
Further, if a pattern of noncompliance can be established, the servicer may be liable to that borrower for additional
damages not to exceed $1,000. The costs of the action and attorneys fees also can be recovered. The statute requires
no qualifying criteria that the borrower must meet before actual damages may be sought from the servicer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) One commenter suggested that the date on the Servicing Disclosure Statement was unnecessary. Another commenter
noted that the Acknowledgment Form requires the applicant to state that he has read and ``understands'' its contents;
however, the commenter stated, this might create potential legal complications.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
HUD response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since the servicer is liable for damages and costs, it is in the servicer's own interest to note, by dating the form,
when the Servicing Disclosure Statement was given (or placed in the mail) to the borrower. In any event, the requirement
is statutory and has been retained in the final rule. Similarly, the language concerning the applicant's understanding
of the disclosure statement reflects the statute and follows common business practice.

Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the undersigned hereby certifies that this rule will not have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. HUD finds that there are no anticompetitive
aspects of the interim rule that are discriminatory with regard to small entities nor are there any unusual procedures
that would need to be complied with by small entities. In any event, by statute, the requirements of this rule must be
adhered to by all lenders and servicers.

At the time of publication of the interim rule, a finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment was
made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). This final rule does not make changes to the interim rule that are significant in
this context. Accordingly, the initial finding of no significant impact remains applicable, and is available for
public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address.

of this rule will preempt State law requirements dealing with identical subject matter. Given the lack of discretion
pertaining to the preemption issue by the statute, further analysis of the federalism implications of the rule would
serve no purpose.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Servicing Disclosure Statement and Applicant Acknowledgement; requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) At the time an application for a mortgage servicing loan is submitted, or within 3 business days after submission
of the application, the lender, mortgage broker who anticipates using table funding, or dealer who anticipates a
first lien dealer loan shall provide to each person who applies for such a loan a Servicing Disclosure Statement. This
requirement shall not apply when the application for credit is turned down within three business days after receipt
of the application. A format for the Servicing Disclosure Statement appears as Appendix MS&hyph;1 to this part. Except
as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the specific language of the Servicing Disclosure Statement is not
required to be used, but the Servicing Disclosure Statement must include the information set out in paragraph (b)(3)
of this section, including the statement of the borrower's rights in connection with complaint resolution. The information
set forth in Instructions to Preparer on the Servicing Disclosure Statement need not be included on the form given
to applicants, and material in square brackets is optional or alternative language.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Applicant's Acknowledgement portion of the Servicing Disclosure Statement in the format stated 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
is mandatory. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional lines may be added to accommodate more than two applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Servicing Disclosure Statement must contain the following information, except as provided in paragraph
(b)(3)(ii) of this section:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Whether the servicing of the loan may be assigned, sold or transferred to any other person at any time while the loan
is outstanding. If the lender, table funding mortgage broker, or dealer in a first lien dealer loan does not engage
in the servicing of any mortgage servicing loans, the disclosure may consist of a statement to the effect that there
is a current intention to assign, sell, or transfer servicing of the loan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The percentages (rounded to the nearest quartile (25%)) of mortgage servicing loans originated by the lender
in each calendar year for which servicing has been assigned, sold, or transferred for such calendar year. Compliance
with this paragraph (b)(3)(ii) is not required if the lender, table funding mortgage broker, or dealer on a first lien
dealer loan chooses option B in the model format in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, including in square brackets
the language ``[and have not serviced mortgage loans in the last three years.]''. The percentages shall be provided
as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) This information shall be set out for the most recent three calendar years completed, with percentages as of the
end of each year. This information shall be updated in the disclosure no later than March 31 of the next calendar year.
Each percentage should be obtained by using as the numerator the number of mortgage servicing loans originated during
the calendar year for which servicing is transferred within the calendar year and, as the denominator, the total number
of mortgage servicing loans originated in the calendar year. If the volume of transfers is less than 12.5 percent,
the word ``nominal'' or the actual percentage amount of servicing transfers may be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) This statistical information does not have to include the assignment, sale, or transfer of mortgage loan servicing
by the lender to an affiliate or subsidiary of the lender. However, lenders may voluntarily include transfers to an
affiliate or subsidiary. The lender should indicate whether the percentages provided include assignments, sales,
or transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) In the alternative, if applicable, the following statement may be substituted for the statistical information
required to be provided in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section: ``We have previously assigned,
sold, or transferred the servicing of federally related mortgage loans.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The best available estimate of the percentage (0 to 25 percent, 26 to 50 percent, 51 to 75 percent, or 76 to 100 percent)
of all loans to be made during the 12-month period beginning on the date of origination for which the servicing may be
assigned, sold, or transferred. Each percentage should be obtained by using as the numerator the estimated number
of mortgage servicing loans that will be originated for which servicing may be transferred within the calendar year
and, as the denominator, the estimated total number of mortgage servicing loans that will be originated in the calendar
year.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) If the lender, mortgage broker, or dealer anticipates that no loan servicing will be sold during the calendar year,
the word ``none'' may be substituted for ``0 to 25 percent.'' If it is anticipated that all loan servicing will be sold
during the calendar year, the word ``all'' may be substituted for ``76 to 100 percent.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) This statistical information does not have to include the estimated assignment, sale, or transfer of mortgage
loan servicing to an affiliate or subsidiary of that person. However, this information may be provided voluntarily.
The Servicing Disclosure Statements should indicate whether the percentages provided include assignments, sales
or transfers to affiliates or subsidiaries.

Disclosure Statements to each applicant for mortgage servicing loans. Each applicant or co-applicant must sign
an Acknowledgement of receipt of the Servicing Disclosure Statement before settlement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) In the case of a face-to-face interview with one or more applicants, the Servicing Disclosure Statement shall

Statement on behalf of the other applicants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If there is no face-to-face interview, the Servicing Disclosure Statement shall be delivered by placing it in

If the terms of any mortgage servicing loan require the borrower to make payments to the servicer of the loan for deposit
into an escrow account for the purpose of assuring payment of taxes, insurance premiums, and other charges with respect
to the mortgaged property, the servicer shall make payments from the escrow account in a timely manner for the taxes,
insurance premiums, and other charges as the payments become due, as governed by the requirements in &sect;3500.17(k).

A lender who makes a mortgage servicing loan or a servicer shall be considered to have complied with the provisions
of any State law or regulation requiring notice to a borrower at the time of application for a loan or transfer of servicing
of a loan if the lender or servicer complies with the requirements of this section. Any State law requiring notice to
the borrower at the time of application or at the time of transfer of servicing of the loan is preempted, and there shall
be no additional borrower disclosure requirements. Provisions of State law, such as those requiring additional
notices to insurance companies or taxing authorities, are not preempted by Section 6 of RESPA or this section, and
this additional information may be added to a notice prepared under this section, if the procedure is allowable under
State law.

On November 15, 1994, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 59070&hyph;59071, Docket No. 94&hyph;116&hyph;1) an advance notice of proposed rulemaking and a notice of
public meetings concerning the possible importation of fresh Hass avocado fruit grown in approved orchards in approved
municipalities in Michoacan, Mexico, into certain areas in the United States. The two public meetings were held on
November 28 and 29. Interested persons were invited to present either written or oral comments at the public meetings
on the Mexican proposal. The notice stated that copies of the Mexican proposal were available by calling or writing
Mr. Victor Harabin. All written comments on the advance notice and Mexican proposal were required to be received on
or before December 13, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the public meetings, copies of the Mexican proposal were also made available. A number of persons in attendance
at both public meetings stated that this was their first opportunity to review the Mexican proposal and that the copies
of the proposal provided were incomplete because Appendices I, II, and III were not included. They requested that
the Appendices be provided and that the comment period closing date be extended to allow time for review of the complete
proposal and comment. APHIS has forwarded copies of these Appendices to those interested persons who requested copies
of the Mexican proposal pursuant to the November 15, 1994,

time to prepare and submit comments on the Mexican proposal, APHIS is reopening and extending the public comment period
on Docket No. 94&hyph;116&hyph;1 until January 3, 1995. APHIS will consider all comments received between November
15, 1994, and January 3, 1995.

 In the notice of receipt for PRM&hyph;35&hyph;12 published on December 2, 1994 (59 FR 61831), the paragraph under
the heading, ``Benefits of the Test,'' revised to read as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner states that under the current regulations, the test is 95 percent accurate and quite inexpensive because
of its simplicity. The test would permit doctors to determine easily whether or not ulcer patients have been cured
of their infection. By providing the public with an inexpensive, easily accessible diagnostic test, more individuals
would be accurately diagnosed and treated for H.pylori infection. This would save the United States an estimated
$500 million per annum over conventional therapy.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice revises an earlier proposed airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D series
turbofan engines, that would have amended an existing AD by eliminating an optional on-wing ultrasonic inspection
of the 10th stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disk, and by including an engine model inadvertently omitted. That
proposal was prompted by a report of an uncontained failure of a 10th stage HPC disk that was previously inspected using
the on-wing ultrasonic inspection method. This action revises the proposed rule by removing the reference to the
inadvertently omitted engine model, as the FAA has remedied this discrepancy in an earlier correction to the AD, and
changing the proposed action from amending AD 81&hyph;08&hyph;02 R2 to superseding that AD. The actions specified
by this proposed AD are intended to prevent uncontained fractures of 9th through 12th stage HPC disks and engine failure.

Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 7, 1984, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued airworthiness directive (AD) 81&hyph;08&hyph;02
R2, Amendment No. 39&hyph;4817 (49 FR 7361; February 29, 1984), to require initial and repetitive inspections of
9th through 12th stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disks at the tierod holes in Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) JT8D series
turbofan engines. That action was prompted by cracks in the tierod holes in HPC disks that resulted in engine failures.
That condition, if not corrected, can result in uncontained fractures of 9th through 12th stage HPC disks and engine
failure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 30, 1984, the FAA issued a correction to AD 81&hyph;08&hyph;02 R2, Amendment 39&hyph;4817 (49 FR 35618;
September 11, 1984), to include an engine model that had been inadvertently omitted from the AD.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since issuance of AD 81&hyph;08&hyph;02 R2, the FAA received a report of an uncontained fracture of a 10th stage HPC
disk. This disk had been subjected to three previous on-wing ultrasonic inspections prior to fracture. This method
has since been determined as inadequate for detecting tierod hole cracking.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 8, 1989, the FAA issued an NPRM that was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (54 FR 22306; May 23, 1989), that would have amended the existing AD by eliminating the optional on-wing ultrasonic
inspection of the 10th stage HPC disk, and by including an engine model inadvertently omitted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the issuance of that NPRM, the FAA has determined that the reference to the inadvertently omitted engine model
was unnecessary, as the FAA had remedied this discrepancy in the August 30, 1984, correction. Also, the FAA now utilizes
a revised format that supersedes existing AD's by publishing a complete document rather than only amending applicable
paragraphs of the compliance section. This document, therefore, reprints the corrected AD compliance section text
in its entirety for clarity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the FAA has changed the format of the proposed rule, the FAA has determined that it is desirable to reopen the comment
period to provide additional opportunity for public comment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are approximately 200 engines which would be affected by this AD, and the FAA has determined that eliminating
the optional on-wing ultrasonic inspection would have negligible economic impact, since most operators use uninstalled
tenth stage disk inspections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action''
under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44
FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative,
on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft
regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document proposes to supersede AD 88&hyph;11&hyph;05, which currently requires repetitively inspecting
the wing spar of Alexander Schleicher Models ASW&hyph;15 and ASW&hyph;15B gliders for wood rot, and replacing any
wing spar where wood rot is found. Alexander Schleicher 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Models ASW&hyph;12 and ASW&hyph;17 gliders are of a similar type 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design of the models affected by the current AD, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in working 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the Civil Aviation Authority of Germany, has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided that the actions referenced in AD 88&hyph;11&hyph;05 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should also apply to these glider models. The actions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
failure of the wing spar caused by wood rot, which, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not detected and corrected, could result in loss of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control of the glider.

A report of an in-flight wing failure because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
box spar wood rot on a Model ASW&hyph;15 glider that was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificated for operation in Australia prompted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA to issue AD 88&hyph;11&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;5997. This AD 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires repetitively inspecting the wing spar for wood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rot on Alexander Schleicher Models ASW&hyph;15 and ASW&hyph;15B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gliders that are certificated for operation in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States, and replacing any wood wing spar where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wood rot is found. These actions are accomplished in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with Alexander Schleicher ASW&hyph;15 Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note (TN) No. 23, dated April 21, 1988. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wing configuration of these gliders includes a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wood box wing spar. Water can penetrate the box spar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interior, which permits the growth of wood destroying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mold fungus. This fungus could destroy the balsa wood 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spar webs and plywood blocks of the spar to the point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the residual spar strength would no longer be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA), which is the airworthiness authority for Germany, recently notified the FAA that
Alexander Schleicher Models ASW&hyph;12 and ASW&hyph;17 gliders contain a similar wing configuration. The LBA
advises that, if periodic inspections are not accomplished on the wing spar of the referenced gliders, then wood rot
could occur. This condition, if not detected and corrected, could result in failure of the wing spar and subsequent
loss of control of the glider.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alexander Schleicher has issued ASW&hyph;12 TN No. 4, dated May 10, 1989, and ASW&hyph;17 TN No. 12, dated May 8, 1989,
which specify procedures for repetitively inspecting the wing spar on the Models ASW&hyph;12 and ASW&hyph;17 gliders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This airplane model is manufactured in Germany and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the
provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness
agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the LBA has kept the FAA informed of the situation
described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the LBA, reviewed all available information, and determined
that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Alexander Schleicher Models
ASW&hyph;12, ASW&hyph;15, ASW&hyph;15B, and ASW&hyph;17 gliders of the same type design, the proposed AD would
supersede AD 88&hyph;11&hyph;05, Amendment 39&hyph;5997, with a new AD that would (1) retain the requirement of
repetitively inspecting the wing spar for wood rot on the Models ASW&hyph;15 and ASW&hyph;15B gliders, and replacing
the wing spar if wood rot is found; and (2) extend these repetitive inspections and possible replacement to Models
ASW&hyph;12 and ASW&hyph;17 gliders. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance with either
Alexander Schleicher ASW&hyph;15 TN No. 23, dated April 21, 1988; Alexander Schleicher ASW&hyph;12 TN No. 4, dated
May 10, 1989; or Alexander Schleicher ASW&hyph;17 TN No. 12, dated May 8, 1989, as applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The compliance time presented in the proposed AD is based upon calendar time instead of hours time-in-service. Rotting
of the wood wing box spar is caused by moisture and the condition could exist or develop regardless of whether the glider
is in actual operation. For this reason, the FAA has determined that the compliance time of the proposed AD action should
be in calendar time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 50 gliders (7 ASW&hyph;12's, 27 ASW&hyph;15's, 6 ASW&hyph;15B's, and 10 ASW&hyph;17's) in
the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 6 workhours to accomplish
the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $60 an hour. Parts cost approximately $110 per
glider, and the proposed core analysis would cost $185. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed
AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $32,750. This figure is based upon the assumption that no affected glider owner/operator
has accomplished the proposed inspection, nor does it account for repetitive inspections. The FAA has no way of determining
the number of repetitive inspections an owner/operator may incur.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, AD 88&hyph;11&hyph;05 required the same actions as is proposed on 33 airplanes. With this in mind, the
cost impact of the proposed AD upon U.S. operators is reduced $21,615 from $32,750 to $11,135.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial
number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation
prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice proposes to establish Class E airspace at Colorado City, AZ. A Nondirectional Radio Beacon (NDB) standard
instrument approach procedures (SIAP) has been developed for the Colorado City Municipal Airport. Controlled airspace
extending from 700 feet and 1200 feet above the surface is needed for aircraft executing the NDB approach. The intended
effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations at Colorado
City Municipal Airport.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class
E airspace at Colorado City, AZ. The effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for IFR operators
executing the NDB approach at Colorado City, AZ. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American
Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as transition areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA
Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1.
The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. Therefore, this proposed
regulation_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant
rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 10034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation
of a Regulatory Evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect
air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposal would modify the Class E airspace at Red Bluff, CA, and Redding, CA. Additional controlled airspace
designated as a surface area for an airport and extending from 700 feet or more above the surface is necessary for three
Standard Instrument Approach Procedures (SIAPs) at the Red Bluff Municipal Airport. These three SIAPs are being
amended to incorporate the use of the Redding altimeter setting for part-time use. This proposal would provide the
controlled airspace necessary for the VHF Omnidirectional Range/Distant Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME), VHF Omnidirectional
Range (VOR), and Nondirectional Radio Beacon (NDB) SIAPs at the Red Bluff Municipal Airport.

The Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class
E airspace areas at Red Bluff, CA, and Redding, CA. This proposed action would provide additional controlled airspace
for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) procedures at the Red Bluff Municipal Airport, specifically, the VOR RWY 33, VOR/DME
RWY 15, and NDB RWY 33 approach to Red Bluff, CA. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American
Datum 83. Class E airspace areas designated as transition areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 and Paragraph
6005 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference
in 14 CFR 71.1. The Class E airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations
for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. Therefore, this proposed
regulation_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant
rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 10034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation
of a Regulatory Evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect
air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
OSM is announcing receipt of a proposed amendment to the Alabama abandoned mine land reclamation plan (hereinafter
referred to as the ``Alabama plan'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed
amendment consists of revisions and additions to the Alabama plan pertaining to the incorporation of contractor
bidder eligibility screening under OSM's Applicant Violator System for the reclamation of coal and noncoal sites;
exclusion of certain noncoal sites from reclamation; requirement of submission of Form OSM&hyph;76 upon project
completion; and, removal of the fourth priority for noncoal reclamation sites. These changes would be applicable
to reclamation of both nonemergency and emergency Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) projects. The amendment
is intended to revise the Alabama plan to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations.

I. Background on the Alabama Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title IV of SMCRA established an AMLR program for the purposes of reclaiming and restoring lands and water resources
adversely affected by past mining. This program is funded by a reclamation fee imposed upon the production of coal.
As enacted in 1977, lands and waters eligible for reclamation were those that were mined or affected by mining and abandoned
or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there was no continuing reclamation
responsibility under State or Federal law. The AML Reclamation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, title VI, Subtitle
A, Nov. 5, 1990, effective Oct. 1, 1991) amended SMCRA, 30 U.S.C. 1231 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to provide changes in the eligibility of project sites for AML expenditures. Title IV of SMCRA now provides for reclamation
of certain mine sites where the mining occurred after August 3, 1977. These include interim program sites where bond
forfeiture proceeds were insufficient for adequate reclamation and sites affected any time between August 4, 1977,
and November 5, 1990, for which there were insufficient funds for adequate reclamation due to the insolvency of the
bond surety. Title IV provides that a State with an approved AMLR plan has the responsibility and primary authority
to implement the program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 20, 1982, the Secretary of the Interior approved the Alabama plan. Background information on the Alabama plan,
including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and the approval of the plan can be found in the May
20, 1982, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (47 FR 22062). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and amendments to the plan can be found at
30 CFR 901.25.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary adopted regulations at 30 CFR Part 884 that specify the content requirements of a State reclamation
plan and the criteria for plan approval. The regulations provide that a State may submit to the Director proposed amendments
or revisions to the approved reclamation plan. If the amendments or revisions change the scope of major policies followed
by the State in the conduct of its reclamation program, the Director must follow the procedures set out in 30 CFR 884.14
in approving or disapproving an amendment or revision.

II. Description of the Proposed Amendment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By letter dated December 5, 1994 (Administrative Record No. AL&hyph;512), Alabama submitted a proposed amendment
to its plan pursuant to SMCRA. Alabama submitted the proposed amendment in response to a September 26, 1994, letter
(Administrative Record No. AL&hyph;511) that OSM sent to Alabama in accordance with 30 CFR 884.15(d). The provisions
of the Alabama plan proposed for revision are ``Administrative and Management Structure of the Alabama Abandoned
Mine Land Reclamation Program Pursuant to 30 CFR Part 884.13(d)'' to incorporate contractor bidder eligibility
screening under OSM's Applicant Violator System for the reclamation of coal and noncoal sites; and ``Ranking and
Selection Procedures Pursuant to 30 CFR Part 884.13(c)(2)'' to exclude certain noncoal sites from reclamation;
to require submission of Form OSM&hyph;76 upon project completion; and, to remove the fourth priority for noncoal
reclamation sites. The changes would be applicable to reclamation of both nonemergency and emergency AMLR projects.

Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory
Planning and Review).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12778
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined
that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section.
However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State and Tribal abandoned mine land reclamation
plans and revisions thereof since each such plan is drafted and adopted by a specific State or Tribe, not by OSM. Decisions
on proposed State and Tribal abandoned mine land reclamation plans and revisions thereof submitted by a State or Tribe
as based on a determination of whether the submittal meets the requirements of Title IV of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1231&hyph;1243)
and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Parts 884 and 888.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

.). The submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon corresponding Federal regulations for which an economic
analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect
upon a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously
promulgated by OSM will be implemented. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant
economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions in the analyses for the corresponding Federal
regulations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
for the chemical substance described generically as polyalkylene polyamine which is the subject of premanufacture
notice (PMN) P&hyph;89&hyph;963 and which is subject to a TSCA section 5(e) consent order issued by EPA. This proposal
would require certain persons who intend to manufacture, import, or process this substance for a significant new
use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing, importing, or processing activities for a
use designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice would provide EPA with the opportunity to
evaluate the intended use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity before it can occur.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed SNUR would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import,
or processing of P&hyph;89&hyph;963 for the significant new uses designated herein. The required notice would provide
EPA with information with which to evaluate an intended use and associated activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Authority 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed
in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B)
of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical
substance for that use. Section 26(c) of TSCA authorizes EPA to take action under section 5(a)(2) with respect to a
category of chemical substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters
of premanufacture notices under section 5(a)(1) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information
submission requirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3),
and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives a SNUR notice, EPA may take regulatory action under
section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities for which it has received a SNUR notice. If EPA does not take action,
section 5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its reasons for not taking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are subject to the export notification
provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Applicability of General Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs are codified at 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. On July 27, 1988 (53 FR
28354), and July 27, 1989 (54 FR 31298), EPA promulgated amendments to the general provisions which apply to this SNUR.
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31252), EPA promulgated a ``User Fee Rule'' (40 CFR part 700) under the authority of TSCA section
26(b). Provisions requiring persons submitting significant new use notices to submit certain fees to EPA are discussed
in detail in that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document. Interested persons should refer to these documents for further information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA published a direct final SNUR for the chemical substance, which was the subject of PMN P&hyph;89&hyph;963 and
a TSCA section 5(e) consent order issued by EPA, in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of June 8, 1993 (58 FR 32227). EPA received a notice of intent to submit adverse comments for this chemical substance
following publication. Therefore, as required by &sect;721.160, the final SNUR for P&hyph;89&hyph;963 is being
withdrawn elsewhere in this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and this proposed rule on the substance is being issued.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is not soliciting and will not respond to comments on any of the other SNURs that were published in the June 8, 1993,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because those rules became effective August 7, 1993, or are being withdrawn and proposed in separate actions. The
supporting rationale and background to this proposal are more fully set out in the preamble to the direct final SNUR
for this substance and in the preamble to EPA's first direct final SNURs published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376). Consult that preamble for further information on the objectives, rationale, and procedures
for the proposal and on the basis for significant new use designations including provisions for developing test data.

IV. Substance Subject to This Rule
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing significant new use and recordkeeping requirements for the following chemical substance under
part 721 subpart E. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=82 g=1 f=1 -->
PMN Number P&hyph;89&hyph;963 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Chemical name:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (generic) Polyalkylene polyamine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
CAS Number:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Not available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Effective date of section 5(e) consent order:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 June 27, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Basis for section 5(e) consent order:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The order was issued under section 5(e)(1)(A)(i), (ii)(I), and (ii)(II) of TSCA based on a finding that this substance
may present an unreasonable risk of injury to the environment, and that this substance is expected to be produced in
substantial quantities and there may be significant or substantial human exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Toxicity concern:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PMN substance and similar chemicals have been shown to cause acute toxicity to aquatic organisms at low levels
of exposure. Specifically, based on data submitted on the PMN substance, the fish acute LC50 value is 780 ppm, the daphnid
acute LC50 value is 10 ppm, and the algal acute EC50 value is 2.9 ppm. Applying an assessment factor of 100 to the daphnid
acute value, EPA predicts that chronic toxicity to aquatic life may occur at concentrations as low as 100 ppb. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Recommended testing:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has determined that the results of a 28&hyph;day repeated dose oral study in rats (OECD Guideline No. 407) would
help characterize possible human health effects posed by the substance. The PMN submitter has agreed not to exceed
the production volume limit without performing this test.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Applicability of SNUR to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final SNUR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as
of the date of proposal rather than as of the effective date of the rule. Because this SNUR was first published on June
8, 1993, as a direct final rule, that date will serve as the date after which uses will be considered to be new uses. If
uses which had commenced between that date and the effective date of this rulemaking were considered ongoing, rather
than new, any person could defeat the SNUR by initiating a significant new use before the effective date. This would
make it difficult for EPA to establish SNUR notice requirements. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture,
import, or processing of the substance for uses regulated through this SNUR after June 8, 1993, will have to cease any
such activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, such persons would have to comply
with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires. EPA, not wishing to disrupt the activities of persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing
for a proposed significant new use before the effective date of the SNUR unnecessarily, has promulgated provisions
to allow such persons to comply with this proposed SNUR before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet the conditions
of advance compliance as codified at &sect;721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the requirements
of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the
substance between proposal and the effective date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they
must cease that activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have
to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires.

VI. Economic Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing significant new use notice requirements for potential manufacturers,
importers, and processors of the chemical substance at the time of the direct final rule. The analysis is unchanged
for the substance in this proposed rule. The Agency's complete economic analysis is available in the public record
for this proposed rule (OPPTS&hyph;50608B).

VII. Comments Containing Confidential Business Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any person who submits comments claimed as CBI must mark the comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or other
appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission will be placed in the public
file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2. Any party
submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a nonconfidential public version in triplicate
of the comments that EPA can place in the public file. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
VIII. Rulemaking Record
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS&hyph;50608). The record includes
basic information considered by the Agency in developing this proposed rule. EPA will supplement the record with
additional information as it is received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will accept additional materials for inclusion in the record at any time between this proposal and designation
of the complete record. EPA will identify the complete rulemaking record by the date of promulgation. A public version
of the record without any CBI is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA NCIC is located in Rm. NE&hyph;B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington,
DC 20460.

IX. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is not ``significant''
and is therefore not subject to OMB review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this proposed rule would not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected
by this proposed rule would likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUR notices for the substance.
Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by the rule would not be substantial, even if
all of the SNUR notice submitters were small firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in this rule under the provisions of the Paperwork
Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and has assigned OMB control number 2070&hyph;0012.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response,
with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2131), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401
M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,
Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public
comments on the information requirements contained in this proposal.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA is proposing a significant new use rule (SNUR) under section 5(a)(2) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
for the chemical substance described generically as an alkenyl ether of alkanetriol polymer, which is the subject
of premanufacture notice (PMN) P&hyph;93&hyph;458. This proposal would require certain persons who intend to manufacture,
import, or process this substance for a significant new use to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing any manufacturing,
importing, or processing activities for a use designated by this SNUR as a significant new use. The required notice
would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use and, if necessary, to prohibit or limit that activity
before it can occur.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed SNUR would require persons to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing the manufacture, import,
or processing of P&hyph;93&hyph;458 for the significant new uses designated herein. The required notice would provide
EPA with information with which to evaluate an intended use and associated activities.

I. Authority 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 5(a)(2) of TSCA (15 U.S.C. 2604(a)(2)) authorizes EPA to determine that a use of a chemical substance is a ``significant
new use.'' EPA must make this determination by rule after considering all relevant factors, including those listed
in section 5(a)(2). Once EPA determines that a use of a chemical substance is a significant new use, section 5(a)(1)(B)
of TSCA requires persons to submit a notice to EPA at least 90 days before they manufacture, import, or process the chemical
substance for that use. Section 26(c) of TSCA authorizes EPA to take action under section 5(a)(2) with respect to a
category of chemical substances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons subject to this SNUR would comply with the same notice requirements and EPA regulatory procedures as submitters
of premanufacture notices under section 5(a)(1) of TSCA. In particular, these requirements include the information
submission requirements of section 5(b) and (d)(1), the exemptions authorized by section 5(h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(3),
and (h)(5), and the regulations at 40 CFR part 720. Once EPA receives a Significant New Use Notice (SNUN), EPA may take
regulatory action under section 5(e), 5(f), 6, or 7 to control the activities for which it has received a SNUN. If EPA
does not take action, section 5(g) of TSCA requires EPA to explain in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 its reasons for not taking action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons who intend to export a substance identified in a proposed or final SNUR are subject to the export notification
provisions of TSCA section 12(b). The regulations that interpret section 12(b) appear at 40 CFR part 707.

II. Applicability of General Provisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General regulatory provisions applicable to SNURs are codified at 40 CFR part 721, subpart A. On July 27, 1988 (53 FR
28354), and July 27, 1989 (54 FR 31298), EPA promulgated amendments to the general provisions which apply to this SNUR.
In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of August 17, 1988 (53 FR 31252), EPA promulgated a ``User Fee Rule'' (40 CFR part 700) under the authority of TSCA section
26(b). Provisions requiring persons submitting SNUNs to submit certain fees to EPA are discussed in detail in that

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 document. Interested persons should refer to these documents for further information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA published a direct final SNUR for the chemical substance, which was the subject of PMN P&hyph;93&hyph;458 in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of October 4, 1993 (58 FR 51672). EPA received adverse comments following publication for this chemical substance.
Therefore, as required by &sect;721.160, the final SNUR for P&hyph;93&hyph;458 is being withdrawn elsewhere in
this issue of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and this proposed rule on the substance is being issued. EPA is not soliciting and will not respond to comments on any
of the other SNURs that were published in the October 4, 1993, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because those rules became effective on December 3, 1993, or are being withdrawn and proposed in a separate action.
The supporting rationale and background to this proposal are more fully set out in the preamble to the direct final
SNUR for this substance and in the preamble to EPA's first direct final SNURs published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of April 24, 1990 (55 FR 17376). Consult that preamble for further information on the objectives, rationale, and procedures
for the proposal and on the basis for significant new use designations including provisions for developing test data.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SNUR for P&hyph;93&hyph;458 stated that EPA was concerned for potential environmental effects of the substance
at concentrations as low as 1 ppb (part per billion) (the concern level) based on the submitted test data and by analogy
to nonionic surfactants. The SNUR also stated that use of the substance as a thickening agent for textile printing
does not present an unreasonable risk due to the fact that the material would not be released to surface waters at concentrations
greater than 1 ppb. As a result, EPA proposed that the significant new use for this material is any use which may result
in release of the substance to surface waters at concentrations greater than 1 ppb. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter was the submitter of P&hyph;93&hyph;458. The commenter stated that the substance is not comparable
to nonionic surfactants because the class of nonionic detergents have different proportions of hydrophobic and
hydrophilic groups and that the determination to regulate this substance should be based on the data provided within
the PMN. EPA used the toxicity data supplied in the PMN to evaluate the acute effects of the substance. However, EPA
also used data from chronic toxicity tests on similar chemicals to evaluate potential chronic toxicity of the substance.
The substance is classified as a nonionic surfactant by EPA because it has the chemical structural characteristics
of nonionic surfactants. The class of nonionic surfactants which EPA has the most data for are the alcohol ethoxylates.
EPA realized that this approach may overestimate the toxicity of the substance, but when evaluating potential chronic
toxicity in the absence of chronic toxicity data on the specific substance, EPA will use the best relevant data set,
even if this may predict higher toxicity, and err on the side of safety rather than underestimate toxicity. Classifying
the substance as a nonionic surfactant does not assume that the PMN substance will be a strong detergent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter stated that on the basis of the acute toxicity studies provided in the PMN, where no mortality or immobilization
were found in the fish and daphnids, a high assessment factor should not be used and the maximum environmental concentration
of 1 ppb is too conservative. EPA agrees that no effects were observed during fish and daphnid acute toxicity tests.
However, the hardness of the dilution water in the acute tests was 250.0 and 246.0 mg/L as CaCO
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, for fish and daphnids, respectively. Hard water is known to decrease the effectiveness of detergents and surfactants.
EPA recommends a hardness of less than 180 mg/L for freshwater fish, and daphnid acute and chronic toxicity tests.
It is possible that if the hardness of the dilution water had been less than 180 mg/L, toxic effects would have been observed.
In addition, effects were observed for green algae. EPA has evaluated toxicity data for chemicals which produce no
effects at saturation during short-term exposures, but do have toxic effects at longer exposures during the fish
early life stage toxicity test and the daphnid reproduction test. EPA has reviewed the submitted acute toxicity and
its analogue data. Based on predicted chronic toxicity values of 1 ppm for fish and daphnids, a measured chronic toxicity
value of 1 ppm for algae and an assessment factor of 10, the revised concern concentration is 100 ppb. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter stated that EPA had not established that release to surface waters above 1 ppb was indeed a new use. The
commenter noted that a Notice of Commencement (NOC) had been filed for the substance on June 16, 1993. The commenter
and its customers have been using the substance since that time without the determination required under 40 CFR 721.90(a)(4),
(b)(4), and (c)(4). The commenter also stated that release of the substance to surface waters at a concentration greater
than 1 ppb did not constitute a change in the type and extent of exposures, production volume, or the manufacturing
process specified in the PMN as required under section 5(a)(2) of TSCA. The commenter asserted that the data submitted
in the PMN does not indicate that the uses other than that submitted in the PMN may be a significant risk to the environment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA disagrees with these assertions. Based on information in the PMN supplied by the commenter, EPA estimated reasonable
worst case water releases during processing and use. None of these estimated water releases were expected to exceed
1 ppb under even reasonable worst case assumptions. The basis for the assumptions made by EPA, including the information
in the PMN and EPA's exposure estimates can be found in the public docket for this substance (OPPTS&hyph;50612). If
any interested parties have data demonstrating releases to surface waters above 1 ppb (or the new concern level of
100 ppb), they should furnish that data with their comments. The mere fact that an NOC has been received or that the determination
required under 40 CFR 721.90(a)(4), (b)(4), and (c)(4) has not been made by the submitter or its customers is not evidence
that releases exceeding the concern level have occurred. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA identified several other uses for the substance including use as a paper binder, a flocculation aid for paper manufacturing,
and a surfactant intermediate. In addition, the commenter noted on the PMN that they intended to import the substance.
The commenter or any other manufacturer could elect to manufacture the substance in the United States. Any manufacturer,
importer, or processor could use or distribute the substance in commerce for the other uses cited in this paragraph.
If domestic manufacture or the other uses of the substance occur, it is possible that a change in the projected volume
of manufacturing and processing, the type, form, magnitude, and duration of exposure, or the reasonably anticipated
manner and methods of manufacturing, processing, distribution in commerce, and disposal could also occur, resulting
in surface water concentrations above the concern level of 100 ppb.

Basis for action:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PMN substance will be used as a thickening agent for textile printing. Based on analogy to nonionic surfactants
and on the submitted acute aquatic toxicity data, EPA is concerned that toxicity to aquatic organisms may occur at
a concentration as low as 100 ppb of the PMN substance in surface waters. EPA determined that use of the substance as
described in the PMN did not present an unreasonable risk because the substance would not be released to surface waters
at concentrations above 100 ppb. EPA has determined that other uses of the substance may result in releases to surface
water at concentrations above 100 ppb. Based on this information, the PMN substance meets the concern criteria under
&sect;721.170(b)(4)(iii). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Recommended testing:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA has determined a chronic 60&hyph;day fish early life stage toxicity test in rainbow trout (40 CFR 797.1600) and
a 21&hyph;day chronic daphnid toxicity test (40 CFR 797.1330), where the dilution water hardness is less than 180
mg/L, would help characterize the environmental effects of the PMN substance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
V. Applicability of SNUR to Uses Occurring Before Effective Date of the Final SNUR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has decided that the intent of section 5(a)(1)(B) is best served by designating a use as a significant new use as
of the date of proposal rather than as of the effective date of the rule. Because this SNUR was first published on October
4, 1993, as a direct final rule, that date will serve as the date after which uses will be considered to be new uses. If
uses which had commenced between that date and the effective date of this rulemaking were considered ongoing, rather
than new, any person could defeat the SNUR by initiating a significant new use before the effective date. This would
make it difficult for EPA to establish SNUR notice requirements. Thus, persons who begin commercial manufacture,
import, or processing of the substance for uses regulated through this SNUR after October 4, 1993, will have to cease
any such activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, such persons would have to comply
with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires. EPA, not wishing to unnecessarily disrupt the activities of persons who begin commercial manufacture,
import, or processing for a proposed significant new use before the effective date of the SNUR, has promulgated provisions
to allow such persons to comply with this proposed SNUR before it is promulgated. If a person were to meet the conditions
of advance compliance as codified at &sect;721.45(h), the person would be considered to have met the requirements
of the final SNUR for those activities. If persons who begin commercial manufacture, import, or processing of the
substance between proposal and the effective date of the SNUR do not meet the conditions of advance compliance, they
must cease that activity before the effective date of the rule. To resume their activities, these persons would have
to comply with all applicable SNUR notice requirements and wait until the notice review period, including all extensions,
expires.

VI. Economic Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has evaluated the potential costs of establishing SNUN requirements for potential manufacturers, importers,
and processors of the chemical substance at the time of the direct final rule. The analysis is unchanged for the substance
in this proposed rule. The Agency's complete economic analysis is available in the public record for this proposed
rule (OPPTS&hyph;50612D).

Any person who submits comments claimed as CBI must mark the comments as ``confidential,'' ``trade secret,'' or other
appropriate designation. Comments not claimed as confidential at the time of submission will be placed in the public
file. Any comments marked as confidential will be treated in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR part 2. Any party
submitting comments claimed to be confidential must prepare and submit a nonconfidential public version in triplicate
of the comments that EPA can place in the public file.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA has established a record for this rulemaking (docket control number OPPTS&hyph;50612D). The record includes
basic information considered by the Agency in developing this proposed rule. EPA will supplement the record with
additional information as it is received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA will accept additional materials for inclusion in the record at any time between this proposal and designation
of the complete record. EPA will identify the complete rulemaking record by the date of promulgation. A public version
of the record without any CBI is available in the TSCA Nonconfidential Information Center (NCIC) from 12 noon to 4 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. The TSCA NCIC is located in Rm. NE&hyph;B607, 401 M St., SW., Washington,

IX. Regulatory Assessment Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements
of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that
is likely to result in a rule: (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially
affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or
State, local or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating
serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially
altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's
priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is not ``significant''
and is therefore not subject to OMB review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), EPA has determined that this proposed rule would not have
a significant impact on a substantial number of small businesses. EPA has not determined whether parties affected
by this proposed rule would likely be small businesses. However, EPA expects to receive few SNUNs for the substance.
Therefore, EPA believes that the number of small businesses affected by the rule would not be substantial, even if
all of the SNUN submitters were small firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
OMB has approved the information collection requirements contained in this proposed rule under the provisions of
the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), and has assigned OMB control number 2070&hyph;0012.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to vary from 30 to 170 hours per response,
with an average of 100 hours per response, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources,
gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions
for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch (2131), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St.,
SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget,
Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public
comments on the information requirements contained in this proposed rule.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Under the corporate average fuel economy program, certain incentives are provided for the manufacture of alternative
fuel vehicles, including dual fuel vehicles. Among other things, dual fuel passenger automobiles which meet a minimum
driving range qualify for special treatment in the calculation of fuel economy. In order to implement a new statutory
requirement, NHTSA is proposing to amend its existing regulation concerning minimum driving range. The minimum
driving range for all dual fuel passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles would be set at 200 miles. The agency
is also proposing to establish gallons equivalent measurements for certain gaseous fuels. These measurements are
needed to calculate the fuel economy of alternative fueled vehicles.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 6 of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 amended the fuel economy provisions of the Motor Vehicle Information
and Cost Savings Act (Cost Savings Act) by adding a new section 513, ``Manufacturing Incentives for Automobiles.''
Section 513 contained incentives for the manufacture of vehicles designed to operate on alcohol or natural gas, including
dual fuel vehicles, i.e., vehicles capable of operating on one of those alternative fuels and either gasoline or diesel
fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 513 provided that dual fuel vehicles meeting specified criteria qualify for special treatment in the calculation
of their fuel economy for purposes of the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards. The fuel economy of a qualifying
vehicle is calculated in a manner that results in a relatively high fuel economy value, thus encouraging its production
as a way of facilitating a manufacturer's compliance with the CAFE standards. One of the qualifying criteria for passenger
automobiles was to meet a minimum driving range, which was to be established by NHTSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA was required to establish two minimum driving ranges, one for ``dual energy'' (alcohol/gasoline or diesel
fuel) passenger automobiles when operating on alcohol, and the other for ``natural gas dual energy'' (natural gas/gasoline
or diesel fuel) passenger automobiles when operating on natural gas. In establishing the driving ranges, NHTSA was
required to consider the purposes of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act, consumer acceptability, economic practicability,
technology, environmental impact, safety, driveability, performance, and any other factors deemed relevant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Alternative Motor Fuels Act and its legislative history made it clear that the driving ranges were to be low enough
to encourage the production of dual fuel passenger automobiles, yet not so low that motorists would be discouraged
by a low driving range from actually fueling their vehicles with the alternative fuels. Section 513(h)(2)(C) provided
that the minimum driving range for ``dual energy'' passenger automobiles may not be less than 200 miles. Section 513(h)(2)(B)
allowed passenger automobile manufacturers to petition the agency to set a lower range for a particular model or models
than the range established by the agency for all models. However, the minimum driving range could not be reduced to
less than 200 miles for any model of ``dual energy'' passenger automobile.

B. Establishment of Part 538 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On April 26, 1990, NHTSA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (55 FR 17611) a final rule establishing 49 CFR part 538, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Driving Ranges for Dual Energy and Natural Gas Dual Energy Passenger Automobiles.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The agency established a minimum driving range of 200 miles for ``dual energy'' passenger automobiles, and a minimum
driving range of 100 miles for ``natural gas dual energy'' passenger automobiles. NHTSA did not specify higher ranges
because it was concerned that such ranges could discourage manufacturers from producing dual fueled vehicles, since
the manufacturers would need to redesign their vehicles to accommodate additional or larger fuel tanks in order to
meet the higher ranges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In part 538, NHTSA also established procedures by which manufacturers may petition the agency to establish a lower
driving range for a specific model or models of ``natural gas dual energy'' passenger automobiles and by which the
agency may grant or deny such petitions.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Energy Policy Act of 1992 amended section 513 of the Cost Savings Act to expand the scope of the alternative fuels
it promotes. The amended section provided incentives for the production of vehicles using, in addition to alcohol
and natural gas, liquified petroleum gas, hydrogen, coal derived liquid fuels, fuels (other than alcohol) derived
from biological materials, electricity (including electricity from solar energy), and any fuel NHTSA determines,
by rule, is substantially not petroleum and would yield substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental
benefits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 513 continued to provide incentives for the production of dual fuel vehicles, i.e., vehicles that operate
on one of a now expanded list of alternative fuels and on gasoline or diesel fuel. NHTSA notes that some statutory terminology
was changed by the 1992 amendments. Among other things, the terms ``dual energy'' and ``natural gas dual energy''
were dropped, and the terms ``alternative fueled automobile,'' ``dedicated automobile,'' and ``dual fueled automobile''
were added. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 513 also continued to require dual fueled passenger automobiles to meet specified criteria, including meeting
a minimum driving range, in order to qualify for the special treatment in the calculation of their fuel economy for
purposes of the CAFE standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One change made by the 1992 amendments concerning driving ranges was that, under section 513(h)(2), the minimum driving
range set by NHTSA may not be less than 200 miles for dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles.
The amendments also provided that the agency may not, in response to petitions from manufacturers, set an alternative
range for a particular model or models that is lower than 200 miles, except for electric vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1992 amendments necessitate amending part 538. First, the existing 100 mile minimum driving range for vehicles
previously categorized as ``natural gas dual energy'' vehicles must be raised to at least 200 miles. Also, NHTSA must
establish a minimum driving range for the expanded scope of dual fueled vehicles. Part 538's petition procedures
also need to be amended to conform to the new statutory provisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to necessitating amendments to part 538's driving range provisions, the 1992 amendments also require
NHTSA to ``determine the appropriate gallons equivalent measurement for gaseous fuels other than natural gas *&blank;*&blank;*.''
Such a measurement is needed to carry out the special fuel economy calculations that apply to alternative fuel vehicles.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this document, NHTSA is proposing to amend part 538 to make it consistent with the 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings
Act. As discussed below, the agency is proposing to set the minimum driving range for all dual fueled passenger automobiles
other than electric vehicles at 200 miles. NHTSA is also proposing to remove the petition procedures until it sets
a minimum driving range for electric dual fueled passenger automobiles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency notes that, due to the complexity of the issues relating to establishment of a minimum driving range for
electric dual fueled passenger automobiles, otherwise known as hybrid electric vehicles, it is addressing that
issue in a separate rulemaking. On September 22, 1994, NHTSA published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 48589) a request for comments seeking information that would help it develop a proposal in that area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency is also proposing in this document to add 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to Part 538, gallons equivalent measurements for compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum
gas, hydrogen, and hythane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that, on July 5, 1994, the Cost Savings Act was revised and codified ``without substantive change.'' The
provisions formerly found in section 513 of the Cost Savings Act are now at 49 U.S.C. 32901, 32905, and 32906.

A. Minimum Driving Range for Dual Fueled Passenger Automobiles Other Than Electric Vehicles
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In light of the 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings Act, NHTSA is proposing to set the minimum driving range for dual
fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles at 200 miles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As before, the agency is required to consider the following factors in prescribing a minimum driving range: The purposes
of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, consumer acceptability, economic practicability, technology, environmental
impact, safety, driveability, performance, and any other factors considered relevant. Moreover, given the purposes
of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act and its legislative history, NHTSA continues to believe that the minimum driving
ranges should be low enough to encourage the production of dual fueled passenger automobiles, yet not so low that motorists
would be discouraged by a low driving range from actually fueling their vehicles with the alternative fuels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed above, NHTSA addressed the appropriate level for minimum driving range in April 1990. The agency believes
that the only relevant changed conditions since that time are: (1) the decision by Congress to require the minimum
driving range for dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles to be at least 200 miles, and (2)
the expanded scope of dual fueled passenger automobiles for which a minimum driving range must be established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 538 currently specifies a minimum driving range of 200 miles for alcohol dual fueled passenger automobiles.
The agency does not believe that any relevant events have occurred since that range was established that should lead
to a different range. NHTSA notes that alcohol dual fueled vehicles are designed so that the same fuel tank is used for
either alcohol or gasoline. The available space in a passenger automobile for fuel tanks is limited. In setting a driving
range of 200 miles for these vehicles, the agency was concerned that a higher minimum range could require some automobiles
to be redesigned to accommodate larger fuel tanks, thereby discouraging the production of such vehicles.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA believes that the same considerations that apply to alcohol dual fueled vehicles also apply to ones fueled by
other liquids. The agency is unaware of any other potentially available liquid alternative fuels that would have
a significantly higher energy content than alcohol on a volume basis. Assuming that other liquid alternative fuels
do not have a significantly higher energy content, a driving range greater than 200 miles for dual fueled passenger
automobiles using any liquid fuel could necessitate redesign of the vehicles to accommodate a larger fuel tank. The
agency requests comments on whether there are any potentially available liquid alternative fuels that do have a significantly
higher energy content than alcohol on a volume basis, and, if so, whether a driving range higher than 200 miles should
be set for such fuels. Depending on the comments, the agency may set a higher driving range for such vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The above discussion assumes that the same fuel tank could be used for both the alternative liquid fuel and gasoline,
as is the case for alcohol dual fueled vehicles. If a separate fuel tank were required for the alternative liquid fuel,
the limited available space in a passenger automobile for such an additional tank would be an even more critical reason
not to set the minimum driving range above 200 miles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gaseous fuels always require a separate fuel tank from gasoline or diesel fuel. In the previous rulemaking concerning
minimum driving range, the agency's concerns about the limited available space in a passenger automobile for additional
fuel tanks led it to establish a 100 mile minimum driving range for natural gas dual fueled vehicles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings Act, NHTSA has tentatively concluded that the minimum driving range
for these vehicles should be increased to 200 miles. As discussed above, the agency cannot set a lower minimum driving
range for these vehicles. Moreover, NHTSA believes that the minimum range should not be greater than 200 miles because
such a range could discourage manufacturers from producing natural gas dual fueled vehicles, given the limited available
space for additional fuel tanks. The agency notes that the concerns it expressed in 1990 about a driving range greater
than 100 miles for these vehicles would be of even greater significance for ranges above 200 miles. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same considerations that apply to natural gas dual fueled vehicles also apply to dual fueled vehicles using other
gaseous fuels, since all of these vehicles require a separate fuel tank from gasoline or diesel fuel. Therefore, the
agency is proposing to establish a 200 mile driving range for these vehicles as well.

B. Proposed Gallon Equivalents for Gaseous Fuels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to carry out the special procedures for fuel economy calculations that apply to alternative fuel vehicles,
it is necessary, for gaseous fuel vehicles, to have a gallons equivalent measurement. The 1992 amendments to the Cost
Savings Act specified that 100 cubic feet of natural gas is deemed to contain 0.823 gallon equivalent of gasoline.
The 1992 amendments required NHTSA to determine the appropriate gallons equivalent measurement for gaseous fuels
other than natural gas, and a gallon equivalent of such gaseous fuel shall be considered to have a fuel content of 15
one-hundredths of a gallon of fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of determining appropriate gallons equivalent measurements for gaseous fuels, NHTSA consulted with the
Department of Energy (DOE) Fuels Utilization Data and Analysis Division. NHTSA and DOE agreed that the following
gaseous fuels could be potential transportation fuels by 2008: liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG), and hydrogen. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to a contract with DOE, Abacus Technology Corporation prepared a report titled ``Energy Equivalent Values
of Three Alternative Fuels: Liquefied Natural Gas, Liquefied Petroleum Gas, and Hydrogen.'' This report is available
for review at the docket number cited in the heading of this notice. The Abacus report develops gallons equivalent
measurements for LNG, LPG, and hydrogen gaseous fuels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the Abacus report, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Mobile Sources recommended
adding hythane fuel (a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas (principally methane)) as a gaseous fuel for which a gallon
equivalent should be calculated. EPA stated that although hythane is currently being used and evaluated on a limited
basis, there is a possibility that hythane fuel may become commercially available as a gaseous fuel. In a follow-up
report, which is also available in the docket, Abacus developed an appropriate gallon equivalent measurement for
hythane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA notes that Abacus recommended using lower heating values for deriving the gallons equivalent measurements
for gaseous fuels because this value represents the energy available from combustion in an engine.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The first Abacus report noted that the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 included natural gas as an alternative fuel,
but did not specify its physical state as a compressed gas or a liquefied gas. The report assumed that the Act was referring
to compressed natural gas, which was the more familiar technology when the Act was passed. The Abacus report recommended
that the same 0.823 gallon equivalent of natural gas established in the Alternative Motor Fuels Act be applied to LNG
based on energy content in British Thermal Unit (BTU)/Standard Cubic Feet (SCF), because LNG composition and heat
of combustion are similar to compressed natural gas.

The Gas Processors Association Standard 2140&hyph;92 specifies four grades of LPG. They are commercial propane,
commercial butane, commercial butane-propane mixtures, and propane HD&hyph;5. Propane HD&hyph;5 is recognized
as the most suitable fuel for internal combustion engines operating at moderate to high engine severity. The Abacus
report concluded that one gallon of LPG, grade HD&hyph;5, is equivalent to 0.732 gallon of gasoline, using a lower
heating value.

4. Hythane
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hythane is a combination of two gaseous fuels: hydrogen and natural gas. Most of the experimental engine work involves
the mixtures of 85 volume percent natural gas and 15 volume percent hydrogen (Hy5). The maximum concentration of hydrogen
that can be used without potentially causing engine problems, such as backfiring, is 15 percent (5 percent energy
content). The second Abacus report concluded that the gallon equivalent of 100 SCF of this hythane mixture is 0.725
using the lower heating value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is proposing to adopt the gallons equivalent measurements for LNG, LPG, hydrogen, and hythane recommended
by the Abacus reports. The agency requests comments on the methodology used to determine the proposed gallons equivalent
measurements. NHTSA also requests comments on whether any other gaseous fuel may potentially be used in automobiles
in the foreseeable future, and thus, whether gallons equivalents for any other gaseous fuels should be established.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA plans to add the gallons equivalent measurements to Part 538. The agency is proposing a new name for this part
to reflect its expanded scope.

A. Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice has not been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking
action and has determined that the action is not ``significant'' under the Department of Transportation's regulatory
policies and procedures. In this NPRM, the agency proposes to set the minimum driving range for all dual fueled passenger
automobiles other than electric vehicles at 200 miles and to establish gallon equivalents for specified gaseous
fuels. None of the proposed changes will result in an additional burden on manufacturers. They would not impose any
mandatory requirements but would instead implement statutory incentives to encourage the manufacture of alternative
fuel vehicles. For these reasons, NHTSA believes that any impacts on manufacturers will be so minimal as not to warrant
preparation of a full regulatory evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify
that this proposed rule, if made final, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. The rationale for this certification is that, to the extent that any passenger automobile manufacturers
qualify as small entities, their number would not be substantial. Moreover, conversion of vehicles to dual fuel status
with the minimum ranges that would be established by this regulation would be voluntarily undertaken in order to achieve
beneficial CAFE treatment of those vehicles. Therefore, no significant costs would be imposed on any manufacturers
or other small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. National Environmental Policy Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The agency has also analyzed this rule for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act, and determined that
it would not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment. Increased evaporative emissions
due to added fuel volume would be the most important environmental impact of this rulemaking if it induced manufacturers
to enlarge the size of existing fuel tanks in order to produce dual fuel vehicles operating on alcohol or other liquid
fuel. However, the proposed minimum range would not make it necessary for these dual fuel vehicles to have enlarged
fuel tanks. Natural gas and other gaseous dual fueled automobiles will not expect to increase evaporative emissions
since gaseous tanks do not normally vent to the atmosphere.

D. Paperwork Reduction Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The procedures in this proposed rule for passenger automobile manufacturers to petition for lower driving ranges
are considered to be information collection requirements as that term is defined by the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) in 5 CFR part 1320. The information collection requirements for part 538 have been submitted to and approved
by the OMB, pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.) This collection of information has been assigned OMB Control No. 2127&hyph;0554. (Minimum Driving Ranges for
Dual Energy Passenger Automobiles) and has been approved for use through June 30, 1996.

E. Federalism
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612,
and it has been determined that the rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation
of a Federalism Assessment.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule would not have any retroactive effect and it does not preempt any State law. 49 U.S.C. 32909 sets
forth a procedure for judicial review of automobile fuel economy regulations. That section does not require submission
of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of this part is to specify one of the criteria in 49 U.S.C. chapter 329 ``Automobile Fuel Economy'' for identifying
dual fueled passenger automobiles that are manufactured in model years 1993 through 2004. The fuel economy of a qualifying
vehicle is calculated in a special manner so as to encourage its production as a way of facilitating a manufacturer's
compliance with the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards set forth in part 531 of this chapter. The purpose is
also to establish gallon equivalent measurements for gaseous fuels other than natural gas.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
. With respect to Standard No. 303, the notice proposes additional labeling requirements for compressed natural
gas (CNG) vehicles. With respect to Standard No. 304, the notice proposes to specify additional performance requirements
that would ensure a CNG fuel container's integrity. The proposes tests include environmental cycling tests, an impact
test, a gunfire test, a flaw tolerance test, a pendulum impact test, and a drop test. Along with the vehicle labeling
requirements, the notice proposes additional labeling requirements for CNG containers. These tests and performance
requirements, which are based on the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition's voluntary standard, NGV2, are intended to ensure
the structural integrity of CNG containers.

Natural gas is a vapor that is lighter than air at standard temperature and pressure.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 When used as a motor fuel, natural gas is typically stored on-board a vehicle in cylindrical containers at a pressure
of approximately 20,684 kPa pressure (3,000 psi). Natural gas is kept in this compressed state to increase the amount
that can be stored on-board the vehicle. This in turn serves to increase the vehicle's driving range. Since natural
gas is a flammable fuel and is stored under high pressure, natural gas containers pose a potential risk to motor vehicle
safety.

Vehicles powered by CNG have not been numerous to date, although they are increasing. The number of CNG vehicles in
the United States has more than doubled from 10,300 in 1990 to 23,800 at the end of 1992. The number of CNG vehicles is
projected to again double to an estimated 50,800 vehicles in 1994. As discussed in detail in a final rule published
on April 22, 1994, establishing Standard No. 303,

On October 12, 1990, NHTSA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to explore whether the agency
should issue Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSSs) applicable to CNG fuel containers and the fuel systems
of motor vehicles using CNG or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a motor fuel. (55 FR 41561). The ANPRM sought comment
about the crash integrity of vehicle fuel systems, the integrity of fuel storage containers, and pressure relief
for such containers.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On January 21, 1993, NHTSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in which the agency proposed to establish
a new FMVSS specifying performance requirements for vehicles fueled by CNG. (58 FR 5323). The proposal was based on
comments received in response to the ANPRM and other available information.The NPRM was divided into two segments:
(1) vehicle requirements that focused on the integrity of the entire fuel system, and (2) equipment requirements
that focused on the fuel containers alone. In that notice, the agency proposed specific requirements applicable
to the initial strength, durability, and pressure relief characteristics of CNG containers. In addition, the agency
sought comments about the effects of corrosion and cold temperature extremes on CNG containers, and their rupture
without fragmentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA received a large number of comments to the docket addressing the January 1993 proposal. The commenters included
manufacturers of CNG containers, vehicle manufacturers, trade associations, other CNG-oriented businesses,
research organizations, State and local governments, the United States Department of Energy, and energy companies.
In addition, NHTSA met with the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) and the Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition (NGVC) and
had telephone conversations meetings with some of the commenters. A record of each of these contacts may be reviewed
in the public docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenters generally believed that a Federal safety standard regulating the integrity of CNG fuel systems and
fuel containers is necessary and appropriate. In fact, some commenters, including the CGA, the NGVC, and CNG container
manufacturers stated that NHTSA should issue a Federal standard as soon as possible to facilitate the safe and expeditious
introduction of CNG fueled vehicles. With respect to the equipment requirements, the commenters generally believe
that Federal requirements about the CNG fuel container integrity are needed and should be implemented as quickly
as possible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to comments addressing the proposed requirements for durability, strength, and pressure relief, some
commenters favored the promulgation of requirements about corrosion resistance, high and low temperature extremes,
damage tolerance, and rupture characteristics of CNG containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As noted above, NHTSA recently established Standard No. 303. It specifies vehicle performance requirements for
the fuel system of vehicles fueled by CNG. The Standard enhances the fuel system integrity of CNG vehicles by subjecting
the vehicles to crash testing and placing a limit on the post-crash pressure drop in the fuel system. The Standard specifies
frontal, rear, and lateral barrier crash tests for light vehicles and a moving contoured barrier crash test for school
buses with a GVWR over 10,000 pounds.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has also issued a final rule that establishes a new Federal motor vehicle safety standard, Standard No. 304,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Compressed Natural Gas Fuel Containers,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 that specifies tests and performance requirements applicable to a CNG fuel container's durability, strength, and
pressure relief. A pressure cycling test evaluates a container's durability by requiring a container to withstand
without any leakage, 18,000 cycles of pressurization and depressurization. This requirement helps to ensure that
a CNG container is capable of sustaining the cycling loads imposed on the container during refuelings over its service
life. A burst test evaluates a container's initial strength and resistance to degradation over time. This requirement
helps to ensure that a container's design and material are appropriately strong over the container's life. A bonfire
test evaluates a container's pressure relief characteristics when pressure builds in a container, primarily due
to temperature rise. In addition, the final rule specifies labeling requirements for CNG fuel containers. These
requirements are based on specifications in NGV2, a voluntary industry standard addressing CNG fuel containers
which was adopted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)

NGV2 specifies four types of container designs. A Type 1 container is a metallic noncomposite container. A Type 2 container
is a metallic liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass is applied in a hoop wrapped pattern over
the liner's cylinder wall. A Type 3 container is a metallic liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass
is applied in a full wrapped pattern over the entire liner, including the domes. A Type 4 container is a non-metallic
liner over which an overwrap such as carbon fiber or fiberglass is applied in a full wrapped pattern over the entire
liner, including the domes.

Based on comments to the January 1993 NPRM and other available information, NHTSA has decided to issue this supplemental
notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM), to propose additional performance requirements and tests to ensure a CNG
container's structural integrity. Among the proposed tests are environmental cycling tests, a low temperature
impact test, a gunfire test, a flaw tolerance test, a pendulum impact test, and a drop test. One environmental cycling
test would evaluate a container's resistance to internal corrosion and high humidity as well as the effects of high
and low temperatures on a container. A second environmental test would evaluate a container's resistance to road
salt and other acidic chemicals. The impact test, known as the Charpy test, would evaluate a metal container's brittle
fracture characteristics under low temperatures. The gunfire test would evaluate container fragmentation. Three
tests, the flaw tolerance test, the pendulum impact test, and the drop test, would evaluate a container's resistance
to external damage. Specifically, the flaw tolerance test would evaluate a container's exterior resistance to abrasion;
the pendulum impact test would evaluate a container's ability to withstand a sharp external blow; and the drop test
would evaluate a container's ability to withstand a blunt external blow. This notice also proposes labeling requirements
applicable to CNG vehicles and labeling requirements for CNG containers in addition to those required by the CNG container
final rule.

Each of the proposed performance requirements and test procedures are modeled after provisions in NGV2 or are similar
to those requirements. The agency tentatively concludes that modeling the Federal standard after NGV2 would be the
best way to regulate how a CNG container reacts to such conditions as corrosive substances, temperature extremes,
external damage, and rupture. In some instances, the agency departed from NGV2's performance requirements and test
criteria to be consistent with 49 U.S.C. 30111 (formerly section 103 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act, 15 U.S.C. &sect;1392). That statute commands the agency to issue ``motor vehicle safety standards'' that are
practicable, meet the need for motor vehicle safety, and are stated in objective terms. One example of such a departure
can be found in the environmental cycling performance requirement for internal corrosion. Instead of stating that
there shall be no ``evidence of distortion, deterioration, or failure,'' the proposal states that the container
``shall not leak or be distorted.'' Another example can be found in the gunfire test conditions. Instead of stating
that ``(t)he distance from firing location to test container is not to exceed 46 meters,'' the proposal states that
``(t)he distance from firing location to test container is 46 meters.'' The most significant differences between
the proposal and NGV2 are discussed below.

Section 1&hyph;18(d)(2) of NGV2 includes an environmental cycling test to prevent the unreasonable corrosion of
a CNG container's internal surface. In addition, this test evaluates the effect that high humidity as well as high
and low temperatures have on the CNG containers.

are susceptible to brittle fracture at low temperatures.

In the ANPRM and NPRM, NHTSA noted that the level of impurities in CNG (i.e., gas quality) could influence the fuel container's
integrity. Specifically, certain compounds in CNG could lead to stress corrosion cracking, corrosion, fatigue
or other internal harm to the container's integrity. Such harm could cause the CNG containers to fail. The agency initially
decided not to propose a performance test to address a CNG container's ability to withstand corrosion, since the agency
was not aware of any readily available performance test that would address the failure modes at issue. Nevertheless,
in the NPRM, NHTSA requested comments about the need for a requirement addressing corrosion and, if so, what tests
and performance levels are most appropriate. In particular, the agency requested comment about the practicability
of using the NGV2's environmental cycling test. In the NPRM, the agency specifically asked whether, instead of adopting
the first sentence of the test verbatim, the agency should say ``One representative container free of any protective
coating shall be cycle tested as follows, and shall not leak *&blank;*&blank;*''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commenters on the NPRM stated that there are two principal ways to regulate containers to prevent unreasonable internal
corrosion: (1) Regulating the gas quality or (2) regulating container performance. NGVC, Pressed Steel Tank Co.,
EDO, the National Fire Protection Association, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA), Tecogen,
and Ontario recommended that the agency adopt gas quality requirements for CNG such as those set forth in a Society
of Automotive Engineers (SAE's) Recommended Practice SAE J1616, ``Fuel Composition for Natural Gas Vehicles,''
February 1994. That recommended practice addresses internal corrosion by limiting the amount of water and other
impurities in CNG.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the comments and other available information. NHTSA has decided to propose a corrosion resistance
requirement for CNG containers. The agency notes that under 49 U.S.C. 30101 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (formerly the Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. 1381 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), NHTSA is authorized to regulate the manufacture of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment. However, it has
no authority to regulate fuel quality since fuel is not considered to be motor vehicle equipment. Therefore, NHTSA
cannot issue standards regulating the quality of CNG. Nevertheless, the agency encourages the industry to improve
gas quality for CNG vehicles through voluntary standards such as SA J1616.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has decided to propose a performance requirement to ensure that a CNG container resists corrosion. Such a requirement
would prevent catastrophic failures of CNG containers due to internal corrosion. This is particularly important
since the agency only has statutory authority to issue safety standards that regulate the condition and performance
of vehicles prior to their first consumer purchase. The agency does not have any authority to require periodic inspection
of containers for corrosion. NHTSA is proposing to adopt an environmental cycling performance requirement and test
procedure patterned after the ones in NGV2. The proposed performance requirement is set forth in S7.5, and the proposed
test conditions and procedures, in S8.5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGV2 states that a ``container free of any protective coating shall be cycle tested, without showing evidence of distortion,
deterioration or failure *&blank;*&blank;*'' The agency believes that while the term ``without distortion'' appears
to be objective, the terms ``without deterioration or failure'' are too ambiguous and broad to permit their incorporation
in a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard. Therefore, the agency has decided not to include the terms ``deterioration''
and ``failure'' in its proposal. Instead, the agency is proposing that its pass/fail criteria for the environmental
cycling test depart from NGV2 and state that, when cycle tested, the CNG container ``shall not leak or permanently
change in external configuration or dimensions.'' NHTSA has added the prohibition against leakage, since the absence
of leakage can be objectively determined. Further, the prohibition is consistent with the environmental cycling
test's safety goal and with the pressure cycling test and hydrostatic burst test that the agency adopted when it issued
Standard No. 304.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under today's proposal, the phrase ``shall not .&blank;.&blank;. permanently change in external configuration
or dimensions'' throughout the test is intended to serve the same purpose as the NGV2 ``no distortion'' criterion.
Thus, if there were a slight bulge in one location or if there were a change in the container's volume by even one tenth
of one percent, the container would be considered to be distorted. A pass/fail gauge could be adjusted to fit the container
before the test, and then used again after the test to verify that a container's dimensions had not changed. NHTSA requests
comments about this ``zero distortion'' requirement, and whether some amount of distortion should be allowed. If
so, how should the permissible amount of distortion be quantified and measured? The agency also invites comments
on how the no distortion criterion might otherwise be objectively expressed. In addition, the agency requests comments
on whether there are other terms, such as fiber delamination, which should be incorporated and how they could be objectively
defined.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As an alternative, NHTSA is considering a no leakage criterion as the sole pass/failure performance requirement.
However, under this alternative, the agency would increase the two sets of 5,000 cycles to 9,000 cycles each. Thus,
the standard would specify a total of 18,000 cycles instead of the 10,000 cycles currently specified in NGV2. The agency
tentatively concludes that the additional cycles would be necessary since this alternative proposal would otherwise
be less stringent than NGV2 which contains additional criteria to disqualify substandard containers, i.e., distortion,
deterioration, and failure. The agency further notes that 18,000 cycles is consistent with the ambient pressure
cycling in NGV2 and in FMVSS No. 304. That cycling represents severe service, i.e., four refuelings per day, 300 days
per year for 15 years. The agency requests comments on this alternative, and on other approaches that might be more
appropriate. In addition, the agency requests that commenters suggesting other approaches include measurable
pass/fail performance criteria and a proposed test procedure.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section S8.5 sets forth the procedures and conditions for the environmental cycling test. As with the proposed performance
requirements, these provisions are modeled after NGV2. The agency has tentatively adopted modified versions of
certain provisions in order to be consistent with the criteria that are within the agency's authority.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGV2 further specifies that during the environmental cycling test the container is pressurized ``using natural
gas or methane.'' This is part of the test's preconditioning phase in which a corrosive material is introduced inside
the container to determine its corrosion resistance. The agency is proposing that only automotive grade natural
gas be used in the environmental cycling test. The agency believes that specifying only one test gas would make the
test more repeatable for enforcement purposes. Further, although the major constituent of natural gas is methane,
natural gas does contain other minor constituents which could make the test performed with natural gas more severe
than if only pure methane were used. Therefore, the use of natural gas would represent a more severe scenario that is
closer to real world use. NHTSA requests comment on the appropriateness of using only natural gas in the environmental
cycling test, rather than specifying both fuels.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has decided to propose language addressing the use of protective coatings that it believes is consistent with
NGV2. Specifically, S8.5.2 states that ``A CNG fuel container 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
free of any protective coating
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' is cycle tested in a specified manner. The agency believes that the phrase ``free of any protective coating'' refers
to temporary coatings such as oil and grease, so as not to inhibit action from the corrosive materials during subsequent
testing. The agency further believes that it would be inappropriate for the agency to preclude permanent coatings
such as paint or other materials, since this would discourage manufacturers from applying permanent coatings that
increase corrosion resistance. The agency requests comments on how best to describe this concept. An alternative
to the proposal to specify ``free of any protective coating,'' would be to specify ``The container shall be in the as
manufactured condition.''

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is also proposing relative humidity conditions during the environmental cycling test. Specifically, under
the proposal, S8.5.2.2 would specify ``Condition the container for 48 hours at zero pressure, 60
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C (140
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F) and 95 percent relative humidity. To obtain the specified temperature and relative humidity, spray with
a fine spray or mist of water at 60
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C (140
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F) in a chamber held at 60
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C (140
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F).'' NHTSA requests comments on how the phrase ``fine spray or mist of water'' could be made more objective,
since different rates of spray might influence the humidity level. As an alternative, the agency is considering a
rate of spray consistent with ANSI standard Z26.1&hyph;1977, which is referenced in FMVSS NO. 205, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Glazing Materials
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. That provision specifies that ``The fine spray of water shall be under a pressure of 172 to 207 kPa (25 to 30 psi) at the
nozzle and in sufficient volume to wet the container immediately upon impact.'' Another alternative would be to specify
a relative humidity level of 95 percent. This would allow manufacturers and test facilities the flexibility to determine
how that level is achieved. The agency requests comments on how best to specify relative humidity in the environmental
cycling test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In comments to the NPRM, Norris and NGV Systems supported an alternative corrosion test issued by the National Association
of Corrosion Engineers (NACE), NACE Standard TM0177&hyph;90. The NACE voluntary standard includes several test
methods for determining the sulfide stress cracking resistance of steels. Sulfide stress cracking corrosion can
result from the presence of too much hydrogen sulfide in natural gas. NHTSA requests comments on the appropriateness
of using the NACE test either in conjunction with or in lieu of NGV2's environmental cycling test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NACE test provides a laboratory method but does not specify acceptable results. If the agency were to incorporate
the NACE test in an FMVSS, it would be necessary to specify performance requirements. The agency believes that this
could be done by making the performance requirements consistent with the ones already contained in the draft International
Standards Organization (ISO) standard for CNG containers (Section A13). If the agency decides to adopt the NACE test,
the NACE Standard Tensile Test method would be used and subsized tensile specimens (gauge diameter 2.54 mm) would
be machined from the wall of a finished container, placed under constant tensile load, and immersed in the NACE test
solution. Tests would be conducted to demonstrate that the threshold stress exceeds 20 percent of the specified minimum
yield strength of the steel, where threshold stress is the maximum stress at or below which no specimen fails the test
for a period of 720 hours. NHTSA requests comments on the need for the NACE test and various aspects of the test, including
the appropriateness of setting threshold stress at 20 percent above the yield strength and the number of tests which
should be conducted to demonstrate this.

C. Road Salt Environmental Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has decided to propose a road salt environmental test for CNG fuel containers to address the potential for container
degradation due to road salt and other acidic chemicals. The proposed test is in addition to the environmental cycling
test already discussed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has decided to propose this requirement after learning of two CNG fiberglass fuel container failures which
occurred in early 1994. NHTSA is concerned about the exposure of container exterior surfaces to acidic fluids, which
may lead to stress corrosion cracking and container failure. Depending on the environmental conditions present,
road salt or salt spray while driving in wet conditions, can be acidic in nature. Therefore, the agency proposes this
road salt environmental test to address these potential safety problems.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The number of test cycles and the pass/fail criterion are the same as those proposed for the environmental cycling
test discussed earlier. However, prior to cycling, the fuel container would be exposed to salt spray in accordance
with American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) B117&hyph;73, ``Method of Salt Spray (Fog) Testing.'' This
method of salt spray testing is used in FMVSS NO. 108, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 for testing the corrosion resistance of headlamps.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposal, a CNG fuel container would be exposed to the salt spray for 240 hours, consisting of ten successive
24 hours periods. Within each period, the container would be exposed to the spray for 23 hours. During the 24th hour,
the salt spray would not be activated. Following the 240 hours of salt spray exposure, the container would then be cycled
for 5,000 cycles, through hydrostatic pressurization, from not more than 10 percent of service pressure to service
pressure. Then it would be hydrostatically pressure cycled for another 5,000 cycles from not more than 10 percent
of the service pressure to 125 percent of the service pressure. When tested in this way, the container would be prohibited
from leaking or permanently changing in external configuration or dimensions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA requests comments on the appropriateness of using this test to address exterior environmental degradation
of CNG fuel containers due to road salt and other acidic chemicals. The agency specifically requests comments on whether
the proposed test would adequately address the potential for stress corrosion cracking of fiberglass overwrap in
CNG fuel containers, and whether it should be applied to all types of CNG fuel containers, including all metal, hoop
wrapped with metal liner, full wrapped with metal liner, and all composite for both fiberglass and carbon fiber. NHTSA
also requests comments on whether the 240 hours of salt spray exposure appropriately reflects the amount of exposure
which can reasonable be expected during the life of a CNG fuel container.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, NHTSA requests comments on the pH level of the salt solution used in the proposed test method. Under ASTM
B&hyph;117, the pH level of the salt solution is in the range of 6.5 to 7.2 at 35
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;C, although the method provides for an upward or downward adjustment in pH. A downward adjustment of pH level
would make the solution more acidic, thereby representing more severe road chemicals which CNG containers may encounter.
It appears possible that stress corrosion cracking of fiberglass may be accelerated with decreasing pH. Therefore,
the agency requests comments on whether a lower pH range for the salt solution should be specified in the test method,
such as three to four.

NHTSA also requests comments on whether to specify the pass/fail criterion for the salt spray test to ``no leakage''
in lieu of ``shall not leak or be permanently changed in external configuration or dimensions.'' Concurrently, the
agency would also increase the number of cycles during testing from two sets of 5,000 cycles each to two sets of 9,000
cycles each. The agency requests comments on whether these modifications in the number of cycles would be appropriate
for the road salt test as well as the environmental cycling test discussed earlier. The agency also requests comments
on the estimated cost of the salt spray test and the extent to which current CNG containers would comply with the requirements.

Section 1&hyph;12(d) and 1&hyph;13(e) of NGV2 set forth an impact test, known as the Charpy test, and performance
criteria to address brittle fracture of steel CNG containers and liners under low temperatures. NGV2 states that
this test is an indicator of the performance of heat treated steels.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 The Charpy test evaluates marginal heat treating performance which can lead to poor fracture performance, degraded
resistance to stress corrosion cracking, and lessened fatigue resistance.

In the NPRM, NHTSA requested comments on whether there is a safety problem sufficiently serious to warrant establishing
a requirement for low temperature testing of CNG container materials. The agency requested these comments due to
its concern that certain materials such as high strength steels can lose their ductility at low temperatures, a situation
that could lead to a container's catastrophic failure. The agency requested specific comments on the Charpy impact
test set forth in NGV2.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGV Systems, ARC, Comdyne, Pressed Steel Tank, EDO, Fiber Dynamics, AAMA, Minnesota Gas, Amoco, Navistar, CNG Pittsburgh,
and Manchester commented about the need for cold temperature testing. All but Manchester believed that the standard
should include some sort of cold temperature testing for containers. Manchester stated that the container's service
environment should be examined to determine if such cold temperature testing is needed. Most commenters stated that
temperature extremes should be accounted for in the standard but did not elaborate about the specific test. PST recommended
that the agency include the Charpy impact test in the Federal standard. AAMA and EDO recommended that the containers
be cycled at ^40
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C (^40
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F) and ^50
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C (^58
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F), respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided to propose amending Standard No. 304 to include a low temperature
test patterned after the Charpy impact test. This test is set forth in sections 1&hyph;12(d) and 1&hyph;13(e) of NGV2,
which references

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methods for Notched Bar Impact Testing of Metallic Materials
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, ASTM E 23. Section 1&hyph;13(e) states that the average energy absorbed by the three test specimens shall not be less
than 100 J/cm2. The minimum value for any one specimen shall not be less than 80 J/cm2. Under the test, a pendulum swings
down and hits a specimen. The test device then measures the amount of energy transmitted into the specimen needed to
break it. If the specimen breaks at low levels of energy, then it would fail the test. To illustrate, while a substance
such as glass would break at very low energy levels, a non-brittle metal would break only at relatively high energy
levels. Specifically, the purpose of this test is to determine the brittle fracture behavior of steels. It also evaluates
the performance of steels which have been heat treated as part of the manufacturing process. An improper heat treatment
process can result in the material being brittle and thus more susceptible to fatigue and stress corrosion cracking.
Non-steel containers and liners need not be tested to comply with the Charpy test because they are not heat treated
this way. The agency requests comments about the agency's decision to propose the Charpy impact test. Is it appropriate
to only apply these requirements to Type 1 containers and Type 2 and Type 3 containers with steel liners? In addition,
NHTSA requests comments on applicable performance tests for fracture and fatigue assessment of liner materials
other than steel, if such materials perform a structural function, e.g., aluminum liners or containers. Along with
this information, commenters should include a description of the specific performance tests recommended, along
with objective pass/fail criteria.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

NHTSA agrees with the recommendations by AAMA and EDO that containers be pressure cycled at low temperatures (e.g.,
^40
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C (^40
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; F)). The agency notes that this low temperature is consistent with test conditions in NGV2 and NHTSA standards,

In response to Manchester's comment that the service environment should be examined to determine if cold temperature
testing is needed for a particular container, NHTSA notes that it would be impracticable to determine what type of
environment each individual container would encounter. In establishing a requirement, the agency believes that
it is appropriate to test CNG containers in a worst case scenario, such as the low temperature levels being proposed.

Section 1&hyph;18(j) of NGV2 includes a gunfire test that evaluates whether a fully pressurized container fragments
upon suffering a high impact puncture. A similar puncture could occur in a motor vehicle crash, causing the propulsion
of container fragments at high speeds. The gunfire test assures that a container will instead essentially remain
in one piece.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, the agency discussed a specific test criterion in which the container would be permitted to rupture only
if there were no fragmentation. The container industry refers to this situation as ``leak before burst.'' Containers
that leak before bursting are designed to release their contents through the sidewall without explosive fragmentation
when the container becomes overpressurized. The industry tests for this characteristic by piercing the pressurized
container with a gunshot. The area around the container is then examined for fragmentation. The container is supposed
to be designed so that no fragments will break off during this failure. In the NPRM, the agency requested comments about
how to define the term ``without fragmenting'' for regulatory and compliance purposes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Brunswick, NGV Systems, PST, EDO, CNG Pittsburg, and AAMA commented about container fragmentation. These commenters
stated that in the event of a rupture, the CNG fuel containers should be designed to release their contents through
their sidewalls without fragmentation. Brunswick, AAMA, NGV Systems, EDO, and PST commented about how to define
the phrase ``without fragmenting.'' EDO recommended that the container be required to remain ``in one piece.'' NGV
Systems stated it should be defined as ``no separation of parts such that projectiles are possible.'' AAMA stated
that it should be defined as ``no separation of pieces exceeding one gram in mass from the fuel tank.'' Brunswick stated
that it should be defined as loss of small pieces not exceeding 30 grams (one ounce) in weight. PST also indicated that
30 grams (one ounce) is an acceptable size.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the comments and other available information, NHTSA has decided to propose amending Standard No. 304 to include
a gunfire test similar to the one set forth in NGV2, with some modifications. The agency believes that if a CNG container
is punctured in a crash, the failure should result in a controllable situation, e.g., fuel leakage, rather than a catastrophic
explosion of the container. A catastrophic failure would present a much more serious failure mode than fuel leakage
through the sidewall, since fragments could be propelled in all directions at high speeds and with tremendous force.
Such fragments could pose a significant safety risk to vehicle occupants and others near the vehicle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the performance criteria for the gunfire test, NGV2 states that ``The tested container shall reveal
no evidence of a fragmentation failure'' and ``Loss of small pieces of composite material which would not have sufficient
momentum to penetrate sheet metal typically found in automobile construction shall not constitute failure of the
test.'' Under the second phrase, NGV2 allows the fragmentation of small pieces, even though the gunfire test is intended
to prevent fragmentation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has tentatively concluded that some of NGV2's performance requirements and test conditions are insufficiently
objective for use in a FMVSS. In order to establish objective, safety criteria, NHTSA has decided to propose incorporating
the recommendations by Brunswick and PST to prohibit fragments exceeding 30 grams (one ounce) in mass. Although the
intent of the gunfire test is to demonstrate no fragmentation, the agency understands that small composite pieces
or fragments are considered normal. Therefore, the agency has tentatively concluded that to prohibit all fragmentation,
as recommended by EDO and NGV Systems would not be practicable. Similarly, the agency believes that AAMA's recommendation
to prohibit the separation of pieces exceeding one gram (0.035 ounce) would not be practicable and would involve very
small pieces that could be difficult to measure. NHTSA has tentatively concluded that prohibiting pieces in excess
of 30 grams would provide for a practicable, objective, and safe performance criterion for the gunfire test. However,
the agency requests comments on the proposed size, and whether the standard should prohibit all fragmentation or
whether some smaller level of fragmentation would be measurable and safe. What is the lightest container fragment
that would be readily measurable and would not pose an unreasonable risk to the safety of motorists? NHTSA also seeks
comment on whether the container should be pressurized with nitrogen or air, since only one gas should be used to assure
consistency of testing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has tentatively determined that it is necessary to depart from certain aspects of the gunfire test in NGV2 to
make the agency's proposed requirement objective and ensure repeatable test results. As proposed in this notice,
these modifications include specifying the precise muzzle velocity, the projectile's path, and the precise distance.

1. General Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NGV2 addresses damage tolerance with three separate tests: a flaw tolerance test, a pendulum impact test, and a drop
test. In general, the damage tolerance tests serve to evaluate damage caused by incidental contact with other objects.
Such contact can occur in a variety of ways. For instance, containers mounted underneath the vehicle could be damaged
by road debris. Similarly, containers mounted in the bed of a pickup truck could be damaged by cargo or tools being thrown
on them. The flaw tolerance test evaluates abrasive damage to composite overwraps such as scratches and small cuts
on the container. If the overwraps are cut or gouged, they may unravel or delaminate, possibly causing container failure.
The pendulum impact evaluates sharp blows to the container. The drop test evaluates blunt impacts to the container.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA did not address damage tolerance in the January 1993 NPRM. Nevertheless, CGA, Tecogen, Comdyne, ARC, and Brunswick
commented that a container's resistance to mechanical damage from incidental contact or road debris should be tested.
Of these commenters, only Brunswick suggested a specific test procedure to determine container damage tolerance.
Brunswick stated that NGV2 adequately addresses resistance to mechanical damage with the flaw tolerance, pendulum
impact, and drop tests. In addition, it stated that the effects of more severe damage, such as a puncture, are addressed
with the gunfire test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has decided to propose the three damage tolerance tests in NGV2 because the agency has tentatively concluded
that, during normal use, CNG containers may be exposed to each type of external damage addressed by these tests. This
may be especially true for containers sold in the aftermarket, since vehicle manufacturers would presumably be more
likely than vehicle converters to design their vehicles to protect containers from exposure to road debris and other
damage. This is so because vehicle manufacturers can design a CNG vehicle with container placement in mind. Converters
are not involved in the original designing of the vehicles they convert and may have to place a container in a relatively
vulnerable location given space limitations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is proposing to subject Type 1 containers to the drop test, but not to the other two tests, since noncomposite
metal containers are generally not affected by the proposed damage evaluated by those tests. Type 2, 3, and 4 composite
containers would be subject to all three damage tolerance tests. The agency requests comments about the appropriateness
of applying the proposed damage tolerance tests to the different types of CNG containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In NGV2, the criterion for each damage tolerance test is that the container, after having a cut made into the container
or being impacted, must sustain 1,500 pressure cycles without evidence of failure such as distortion or leakage.
The only exception to this is the drop test. The drop test in NGV2 requires two alternative sets of cycling tests. If
the container sustains damage that would cause its rejection at a three year inspection interval specified by NGV2,
the container is tested for 1,500 cycles. In contrast, if the container sustains damage that would cause it not to be
rejected at a three year inspection, it is tested for 18,000 cycles. The 1,500 cycles in NGV2 apparently corresponds
to the maximum number of fills expected during the three year inspection interval. Because NGV2 requires reinspection
every three years, it is structured to permit a level of damage to the container that would keep it in service until the
maximum inspection interval of three years is completed. In contrast, NHTSA has no statutory authority to require
container inspection after the first consumer purchase of the container.

In today's notice, NHTSA is proposing 1,500 cycles for the flaw tolerance and pendulum impact tests, and the more severe
alternative of 18,000 cycles for the drop test. This is consistent with the manner of cycles specified in NGV2, after
which the agency is patterning its proposal. However, since NHTSA has no authority to require the periodic inspection
of CNG containers, the agency requests comments on whether 1,500 cycles is adequate to assure the safety of a CNG container
throughout its life. As a alternative, the agency is considering requiring 18,000 cycles for the flaw tolerance and
pendulum impact tests. This is consistent with the pressure cycling test in FMVSS No. 304 and with the drop test where
no inspection would be involved. It would also represent the worst case scenario for a container which sustains damage
early in its service life, but may not be subsequently inspected, since 18,000 cycles represents four refuelings
per day, 300 days per year for 15 years. The agency requests comments on the appropriate number of cycles for the flaw
tolerance, pendulum impact, and drop tests to assure the safety of the traveling public.

2. Flaw Tolerance Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1&hyph;18(f)(1) of NGV2 sets forth a flaw tolerance test, which evaluates a container's ability to withstand
external damage caused by abrasive material scratching a container, NHTSA is proposing to adopt the flaw tolerance
test in NGV2 with some minor modifications. The agency's adaptation of these performance requirements and test conditions
and procedures is set forth in sections S7.8 and S8.8 of this notice's regulatory text.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGV2's flaw tolerance test specifies that the container shall be tested ``without evidence of distortion, deterioration
or failure'' and ``show no evidence of flaw propagation
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 or other physical damage likely to weaken the container appreciably.'' as explained in the earlier discussion on
the environmental cycling test, these performance requirements contain subjective criteria that the agency believes
need to be modified to be objective and enforceable. The agency believes that the terms ``without deterioration or
failure'' and ``other physical damage likely to weaken the container appreciably'' are unreasonably ambiguous
and broad. Therefore, the agency has decided not to include, in the proposed requirement, the terms ``deterioration''
and ``failure'' and the phrase ``other physical damage likely to weaken the container appreciably'' since these
terms are not sufficiently objective to include in a Federal standard and would not provide measurable criteria for
enforcement. The agency welcomes comments about ways to refine terms to make them objective. In addition, the agency
requests comments on whether there are other terms, such as fiber delamination, which should be incorporated and
how they could objectively be defined.

Instead, the agency is proposing a modified version of the NGV2 pass/fail criteria for the flaw tolerance test that
states that when cycle tested, the CNG container ``shall not leak or permanently change in external configuration
or dimension.'' In addition, NHTSA is proposing an additional performance provision to prohibit the growth of a longitudinal
cut made in the container. NHTSA has added the prohibitions against leakage and increase in the size of cut since compliance
with them can be objectively determined. It is also consistent with the flaw tolerance test's safety goal and with
the performance requirements for the presence cycling test and the hydrostatic burst test in Standard No. 304. The
agency previously discussed the no distortion criterion in the environmental cycling section and request similar
comments here. In addition, the other requirement being proposed for the flaw tolerance test is that the ``cut made
in accordance with S8.8 for the purpose of this test shall not increase in length, width or depth as a result of this test.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has tentatively determined that it is also necessary to depart from certain aspects of NGV2's flaw tolerance
test procedures and conditions to make agency's flaw tolerance test objective and repeatable. As proposed in this
notice, these modifications include specifying the precise dimensions and location of the flaw.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGV2 specifies that a cut be made in the other wall at approximately midlength and that the cut be not less than 0.75 mm
(0.030 inches) in depth. The agency is proposing additional provisions to make the proposed FMVSS more precise, thereby
increasing the test procedure's objectivity and repeatability. For instance, the agency is proposing to amend the
standard to specify that the cut be 0.75 mm wide. The agency tentatively believes that these dimensions represent
abrasions that containers may experience as a result of contacting road debris. However, the agency requests comments
on the cut's dimensions, including the appropriate width, and whether the length, width, and number of such cuts should
be increased.

3. Pendulum Impact Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1&hyph;18(f)(2) of NGV2 sets forth a pendulum impact test which evaluates a container's ability to withstand
a sharp external blow. NHTSA is proposing to adopt the pendulum impact test in NGV2 with some minor modifications.
The agency's adoption of these performance requirements and test conditions is set forth in sections S7.9 and S8.9
of this notice's regulatory text.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGV2 specifies that ``The tests shall be made on the points of the container which are regarded as vulnerable. The points
regarded as vulnerable are those which are most exposed or weakest having regard to the shape of the container and/or
the way in which it is installed on the vehicle.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has decided to propose modifying this provision since it is not objective. Instead, the agency is proposing
to require that the pendulum impact test be conducted at ``any point and any angle.'' NHTSA anticipates that to be able
to certify compliance with the requirement, manufacturers would direct the test impacts to the container's most
vulnerable points. Such a test procedure would be consistent with the regulatory language specified in Standard
No. 301's moving contoured barrier test. The agency requests comments about whether such a test condition would be
appropriate for pendulum impact testing of CNG containers.

4. Drop Test
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Section 1&hyph;18(g) of NGV2 sets forth a drop test, which evaluates a container's ability to withstand a blunt external
blow. NHTSA is proposing to adopt the drop test in NGV2 with some minor modifications. The agency's adoption of these
performance requirements and test procedures is set forth in sections S7.10 and S8.10 of this notice's regulatory
text.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with NGV2, NHTSA is proposing to specify that a container be dropped at ambient temperature without internal pressurization
or attached valves. In the test, the container is held in a horizontal position with the container's bottom 3.05 meters
(10 feet) above the surface onto which it is dropped.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's proposal, consistent with NGV2, specifies that the surface onto which the CNG container is dropped ``shall
be a smooth, horizontal concrete pad or flooring.'' NHTSA notes that this definition of the surface is not fully objective.
As an alternative, the agency is considering specifying that the surface be made of concrete that is at least four inches
thick. NHTSA requests comments on this alternative, and on how the surface could otherwise be more objectively defined.

G. Bonfire Test Fuel
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed that the fire for the bonfire tests be generated by No. 2 diesel fuel. This fuel type was proposed
so that the standard would be consistent with the bonfire test in NGV2, which specifies this type of fuel.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NGVC, CGA, AAMA, and Norris commented that the agency should specify a different fuel to generate a bonfire that is
more environmentally sound. CGA stated that the large amounts of smoke that would be created by burning diesel fuel
are contrary to the environmental objectives of developing CNG vehicles. NGVC and Norris suggested using a CNG or
propane grill for the test.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, NHTSA decided to specify the use of No. 2 diesel fuel. The agency explained that it was aware of the
environmental problems associated with this type of fuel and would further study whether other fuels should be used
to generate the bonfire test. However, the agency stated that until it could determine that a different fuel is an appropriate
(e.g., generates a fire of comparable heat and intensity) replacement for No. 2 diesel fuel, that fuel will be specified
for generating the bonfire.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has decided to propose to amend the bonfire test conditions to allow alternative types of fuel, given the environmental
difficulties resulting from No. 2 diesel fuel. One alternative would be to allow manufacturers to conduct the test
with any fuel that generates a flame temperature equivalent to that of No. 2 diesel fuel. Under this alternative, any
fuel that generates a flame temperature of 850
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to 900
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C (the flame temperature of No. 2 diesel fuel) for the duration of the test, would be permitted. To verify the flame
temperature of 850
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; to 900
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir; C for a period of 20 minutes, or until the container is fully vented or fails, three thermocouples would be located
on the container's bottom, 102 mm above the fuel surface, as measured before the fire is started. The thermocouples
would be placed so that one would be at the center of the container's bottom and one on each side of the container where
the dome and sidewall intersect. NHTSA requests comments about the appropriateness of this alternative, including
the use of flame temperature to define ``equivalence'' among fuel types. Would a different fuel characteristic such
as Btu/lb be more appropriate? If a commenter believes that an alternative approach would be more appropriate, it
should submit the test procedures associated with such an alternative.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
a. Labeling information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the NPRM, NHTSA proposed to require that container manufacturers certify that each of their containers comply
with the proposed equipment requirements by permanently labeling the container with the following information:
The symbol ``DOT'' to constitute a certification by the manufacturer that the container conforms to all requirements
of the standard; the date of manufacture of the container; the name and address of the container manufacturer; and
the maximum service pressure. The agency stated that labeling the container would provide vehicle manufacturers
and consumers with assurance that they are purchasing containers that comply with the Federal safety standards.
In addition, the agency believed that the proposed requirement would facilitate the agency's enforcement efforts
by providing a ready means of identifying the container and its manufacturer.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EDO, NGVC, Thomas, NYCFD, and Volvo GM addressed the proposed labeling requirements. EDO and NYCFD stated that the
label should include the maximum fill pressure at a location close to the fill receptacle. NGVC recommended that a
blank area for the container installation date be included in the label to be filled in by the installer. Volvo GM stated
that only containers manufactured after the standard's effective date should be entitled to display the DOT symbol.
Thomas stated, without elaboration, that the labeling requirements of NGV2 should be adopted. NHTSA's proposal
did not include certain information specified in NGV2, including the type of container, inspector symbols, trademarks,
manufacturers's part number, and serial numbers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the CNG container final rule, NHTSA decided to adopt the proposed labeling requirements with a slight modification
from the proposed format. In item (a), the agency modified the proposal which states ``The tank manufacturer's name
and address'' to state the following: include the statement that ``If there is a question about the proper use, installation,
or maintenance of this container, contact [
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
manufacturer's name, address, and telephone number
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
].'' In the final rule, the agency decided not to require the other additional items of information in NGV2 since the
agency had not proposed requiring such information. Notwithstanding the agency's decision not to require this additional
information, the agency explained that a manufacturer may list such information on the label, provided that the additional
information does not obscure or confuse the required information. In particular, NHTSA urged manufacturers to include
the container type, e.g., Type 1, 2, 3 or 4, since the agency had adopted NGV2's design and material specifications
in the final rule. The agency believed that specifying the type of container would facilitate oversight of compliance
tests since each type of container is required to undergo a hydrostatic burst test with a safety factor unique to that
type.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the final rule, NHTSA also explained that it anticipated proposing additional requirements about the CNG fuel
container's label. The agency is now proposing to amend S7.4 to specify that CNG containers be labeled with the following
additional information:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The container designation (Type 1, 2, 3, or 4),
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The statement ``CNG ONLY,''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The statement: ``This container should be visually inspected after a motor vehicle accident or fire and at least
every 36 months for damage and deterioration in accordance with the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) guidelines
C&hyph;6 and C&hyph;6.1 for Type 1 containers and C&hyph;6.2 for Types 2, 3, and 4 containers.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The statement: ``Do Not Use After 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->
XXXXXX
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
,'' inserting the year that is the 15th year beginning after the year in which the container is manufactured.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA believes that it would be in the interest of motor vehicle safety to add this information to the CNG container
label. Adding information about container type, e.g., Type 1, 2, 3 or 4 would be consistent with the agency's adoption
of NGV2's design and material specifications in the CNG final rule. The agency believes that specifying the type of
container would facilitate oversight of compliance tests since each type of container is required to undergo a hydrostatic
burst test with a safety factor unique to that type. Adding the phrase ``CNG ONLY'' would assure that CNG containers
are used only for CNG and are not used for other fuels for which the containers were not designed, such as liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since NHTSA has no statutory authority to require the periodic inspection of CNG containers after the first consumer
purchase, adding information about periodic inspections would help assure their safe use after this time. Such statements
would alert owners to the desirability for reinspection over time or in the event of an accident. The agency notes that
the proposed requirement is consistent with NGV2's guidelines for visual inspection of CNG containers every 36 months.
Reference to the CGA guidelines would provide standardized criteria by which to inspect containers built by different
manufacturers. The agency is proposing use of the visual inspection guidelines contained in CGA C&hyph;6, C&hyph;6.1,
and C&hyph;6.2, and not those for hydrostatic testing. In addition to the proposal that the container be inspected
after an accident or at least every 36 months, NHTSA requests comments about the need to specify both a time interval
and a mileage interval (e.g., the agency could require the following statement: ``This container should be visually
inspected after a motor vehicle accident or fire, and for damage or deterioration at least every 36 months or 36,000
miles, whichever comes first, in accordance with .&blank;.&blank;.''). What time and mileage intervals would be
most appropriate? Would an agency requirement for inspection every 12 months be appropriate?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA is proposing to require information about the container's service life in the belief that this information
would help assure that a CNG container is removed from service after its design service life expires. As commenters
on the NPRM stated, this is especially important since there is a finite period during which CNG containers can be used
safely. The agency is proposing 15 years because CNG containers built to follow NGV2 have a design service life of 15
years. Nevertheless, since containers may be built for a service life other than 15 years, the agency would allow a
manufacturer to specify the service life length appropriate to its containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency requests comments about the need for each of these proposed items of information and alternative ways to
specify this information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Label location. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the NPRM, EDO and NYCFD stated that the label should include certain labeling information such as the
maximum fill pressure at a location close to the fill receptacle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NHTSA has decided to propose requirements related to the label's location. Accordingly, the agency has decided to
propose that the containers be installed in a manner that ensures the visibility of the container labeling. Specifically,
the agency is proposing to require the label to be near the end of the container containing the outlet valve, since such
a location would help ensure that the label would be more visible during refueling. The agency notes that NGV2 contains
a similar requirement.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CNG vehicle final rule did not specify requirements for the labeling of CNG fueled vehicles. In this SNPRM, the
agency is proposing to amend Standard No. 303 to include two items of information.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
S5.3.1&blank;The statement: ``Maximum service pressure 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
S5.3.2&blank;The statement ``See instructions on fuel container for inspection and service life.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency believes that the first item of information would help assure that CNG containers are not overfilled during
refueling. The second item is intended to assure that vehicle owners and operators are informed about the important
safety information on container inspection. In addition, the agency is proposing that for vehicles manufactured
or converted prior to the first sale to the consumer, the manufacturer provide this information in writing to the consumer,
either in the owner's manual or on a one page statement. The agency requests comments about the need for vehicle labeling
and written information bearing this and other information.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA requests comments on the following additional issues related to the safe performance of CNG containers. What
are the safety implications of fast-filling CNG containers during refueling, which can result in pressure levels
of 125 percent of service pressure due to the heat of pressurization? Do the initial permeation rates of CNG containers
constructed of nonmetallic liners remain constant over the life of the container? What are the consequences of gas
permeation from vehicles fueled by multiple CNG containers? What are the degradation characteristics of vinyl esters
and thermoplastic resins for composite material? Should containers and container liners have longitudinal or circumferential
welds?

J. Leadtime
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA is proposing to make the requirements in this notice effective one year after publication of the final rule in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The agency believes this would be a reasonable time period for container manufacturers to test their containers
and certify compliance to the additional tests being proposed in this notice. The agency anticipates that container
manufacturers would readily be able to certify compliance to the proposed requirements. This is because container
manufacturers already certify compliance with NGV2, which is essentially consistent with the proposed requirements.
The one exception is the proposed salt spray test. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The agency requests comments about the leadtime. Does one year provide sufficient time for manufacturers to certify
compliance to the proposed requirements? Would the addition of the proposed salt spray test require a longer leadtime
than one year?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the meantime, prior to the standard's effective date, the industry is free to advertise containers as meeting the
CNG equipment standard that will take effect in one year. Manufacturers have sought to achieve early compliance with
other agency requirements
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 such as those relating to dynamic side impact protection and air bags. The agency encourages manufacturers to seek,
to the extent feasible, to manufacture their CNG containers to meet these new requirements before the date the standard
takes effect.

However, the agency emphasizes that a manufacturer may not certify a container as meeting the equipment standard
until the standard goes into effect. Under the statte, a certification is a statement that a vehicle or item of equipment
meets all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Standards that are then in effect. Therefore, until a standard is effective,
manufacturers may not certify compliance with it.

K. Benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As explained earlier, NHTSA anticipates that the number of CNG fuel vehicles will increase greatly in the near future,
in light of directives by the Clinton Administration and legislation by Congress to develop vehicles powered by cleaner
burning fuels. This notice will enhance the safety of this growing population of vehicles, since CNG containers will
be required to comply with the tests in Standard No. 304. The necessity for certifying compliance with the Federal
requirements will provide added assurance that the containers are safe. The benefits of the proposal to issue additional
requirements applicable to CNG containers are to provide assurances of the structural integrity of the CNG containers.
The agency is adding one test not currently part of NGV2 (the salt spray test) to simulate environmental roadway conditions.
In addition, by helping to minimize any safety concerns associated with CNG vehicles, this rule should result in positive
environmental impacts.

 L. Costs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For six of the seven tests proposed, there would be no additional costs of upgrading current containers to comply with
the proposed requirements, since CNG container manufacturers already comply with NGV2. Similarly, there would
be no additional compliance test costs for these six tests, since the manufacturers already meet the NGV2 tests. Testing
and container costs for these six tests are estimated to range from $13,800 to $30,650 per container size and type.
The agency does not know whether existing containers can meet the proposed salt spray test, and what costs might be
incurred if the containers do not meet the proposed test. The agency estimates that the testing and container cost
for the salt spray test to range from $1,220 to $4,130. Total testing and container cost for the proposal are $15,020
to $34,780. The agency has made the criteria in some of the tests more objective than NGV2 by changing unacceptably
subjective and broad terms to more measurable and therefore more objective criteria.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has considered the impact of this rulemaking action under Executive Order 12866 and the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. This rulemaking document was not reviewed under E.O. 12866, ``Regulatory Planning
and Review.'' This action has been determined to be ``nonsignificant'' under the Department of Transportation's
regulatory policies and procedures. NHTSA has estimated the costs of the amendments in a Preliminary Regulatory
Evaluation (PRE) which has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking. As discussed in that document, NHTSA estimates
that total testing and container costs for this proposal are $15,020 to $34,780 per container size and type. The agency
believes that a CNG container which meets the current industry standard, NGV2, would also comply with the requirements
of this proposal, with the exception of the salt spray test.

NHTSA has also considered the effects of this rulemaking action under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Based upon
the agency's evaluation, I certify that this rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number
of small entities. For six of the seven tests, there will be no small business impacts since the proposed standards
are already being met. Comments are requested on current compliance with the salt spray test and whether this would
have small business impacts. Information available to the agency indicates that the businesses manufacturing CNG
fuel containers are not small businesses.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
NHTSA has analyzed this rulemaking action in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the national Environmental Policy Act of 1969, NHTSA has considered the environmental impacts
of this rule. The agency has determined that this rule would have no adverse impact on the quality of the human environment.
On the contrary, because NHTSA anticipates that ensuring the safety of CNG vehicles would encourage their use, NHTSA
believes that the rule would have positive environmental impacts since CNG vehicles are expected to have near-zero
evaporative emissions and the potential to produce very low exhaust emissions as well.

The proposal does not have any retroactive effect. Under 49 U.S.C. 30103, whenever a Federal motor vehicle safety
standard is in effect, a State may not adopt or maintain a safety standard applicable to the same aspect of performance
which is not identical to the Federal standard, except to the extent that the State requirement imposes a higher level
of performance and applies only to vehicles procured for the State's use. 49 U.S.C. 30161 sets forth a procedure for
judicial review of final rules establishing, amending or revoking Federal motor vehicle safety standards. That
section does not require submission of a petition for reconsideration or other administrative proceedings before
parties may file suit in court.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes endangered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
status pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Act) for four plants: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Lasthenia conjugens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (Contra Costa 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
goldfields), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Navarretia leucocephala
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 ssp. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
pauciflora
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (few-flowered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
navarretia), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Navarretia leucocephala
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 ssp. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
plieantha
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (many-flowered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
navarretia), and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
Parvisedum leiocarpum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(Lake County stonecrop). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These species grow in and around the margins of vernal pools and in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seasonally wet areas in northern California. Habitat loss and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degradation imperil the continued existence of these plants. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal, if made final, would implement the protection of the Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these plants.

Lasthenia conjugens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is a showy spring annual in the aster 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
family (Asteraceae) that grows 10 to 30 centimeters (cm) (4 to 12 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inches (in)) tall and is usually branched. The leaves are opposite, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
light green, and usually have a feather-like arrangement with narrow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clefts extending more than halfway toward the stem. The flowers are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in terminal yellow heads. The phyllaries are one-third to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one-half fused; the achenes are less than 1.5 millimeters (mm) (0.06 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Lasthenia conjugens
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 consists of vernal pools in

open grassy areas in woodland and valley grassland communities at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
elevations of 1 to 445 meters (m) (3 to 1,460 feet (ft)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Historically found in such habitats in Alameda, Contra Costa, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mendocino, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Napa, and Solano Counties, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
California, this species is now apparently restricted to five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
localized populations in Napa and Solano Counties (California Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Plant Society (CNPS) 1978). One population is located on Travis Air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Force Base, Solano County, California. All other populations are on

is a prostrate, spreading, and much-branched annual herb in the phlox family (Polemoniaceae). This plant grows 1
to 4 cm (0.4 to 1.6 in) in height. The nearly hairless leaves are linear and entire, or parted into a few linear lobes,
and 1 to 2.5 cm (0.4 to 1.0 in) long. The inflorescence is a head of 2 to 15 blue or white (fading to blue) flowers. A few spiny,
leaf-like bracts below each head extend out 1.5 to 3 times the radius of the head; bracts within the head are shorter.
The funnel-shaped corollas are 5 to 7 mm (0.2 to 0.3 in) long with five lobes 1.5 mm (0.06 in) long. Each corolla lobe has
a single unbranched vein. The stigma has two minute lobes.

20 to 50 white or blue flowers. Each head is 1.5 to 2 cm (0.6 to 0.8 in) across and is subtended by 3 to 4 leaf-like bracts
that are simple-pinnate or compound-pinnate and extend out 1 to 2 times the radius of the head. The bracts within the
head are shorter. The funnel-shaped corolla is 5 to 6 mm (0.2 to 0.24 in) long with five lobes each 2 mm (0.7 in) long. The
stigma is two-cleft or entire.

Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended in 1982, requires the Secretary to make certain findings
on pending petitions within 12 months of their receipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that
all petitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newly submitted on that date. This was the case
for

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Parvisedum leiocarpum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
because the 1975 Smithsonian report had been accepted as a petition. On October 13, 1982, the Service found that the
petitioned listing of these species was warranted, but precluded by other pending listing actions, in accordance
with section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act; notification of this finding was published on January 20, 1984 (49 FR 2485).
Such a finding requires the petition to be recycled, pursuant to section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Act. The finding was
reviewed in October of 1983 through 1993. Publication of this proposal constitutes the final finding for the petitioned
action.

consist of activities that result in the destruction of the plants or hydrologic changes in their vernal pool habitats.
Such activities include urbanization, industrial development, agricultural land conversion, off-highway vehicle
use, horseback riding, trampling by grazing cattle, and road widening. Damage or destruction of vernal pool habitat
happens quickly and easily due to the extremely friable nature of the soil and the dependency of the pool upon an intact
durapan or impermeable subsurface soil layer.

to decline due to anthropogenic activities. Two population sites have been adversely affected by drainage or, in
one case, by the attempt to create a more permanent water source (CDFG 1989b). One partially drained site, Manning
Flat in Lake County, has experienced significant accelerated soil erosion, reducing the amount of available habitat
and the plant population (McCarten 1985; CDFG 1989b). Off-highway vehicle use has damaged several population sites
in Lake County (CDFG 1989b; CNDDB 1993). Agricultural land conversion to a rice field adversely affected another
population site in Lake County (CDFG 1989b). Pond construction for cattle watering partially destroyed the population

resulted in the destruction of plants and habitat of this subspecies at one location in Sonoma County, and at four population
sites in Lake County (CDFG 1991a). Urbanization threatens one population site in Lake County and the extant population
site in Sonoma County (CNDDB 1993). Attempted drainage of a pool in Lake County containing

of two of the three remaining vernal pools containing populations of this plant (CNPS 1990b). Drainage attempts at
one of the sites resulted in severe erosion and a reduction of habitat and plant numbers (CNPS 1990b). Widening of Highway
29 by California Department of Transportation also threatens to impact this population (CNPS 1990b). Discing has
occurred at the third population site (CNDDB 1993). All population localities occur on privately owned, flat land
next to major roads. This makes them vulnerable to urban development and agricultural land conversion (CDFG 1989a,
CNPS 1990b). Off-highway vehicle use has occurred at two of the three

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of the California Fish and Game Code and Title 14 California Code of Regulations 670.2 ). The California Fish and Game
Commission also has listed

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) as threatened. Listing by the State of California requires individuals to obtain a memorandum of understanding
with the CDFG to possess or ``take'' a listed species. Although the ``take'' of State-listed plants is prohibited
(California Native Plant Protection Act, Chapter 10 Section 1908 and California Endangered Species Act, Chapter
1.5 Section 2080), State law exempts the taking of such plants via habitat modification or land use changes by the owner.
After CDFG notifies a landowner that a State-listed plant grows on his or her property, State law requires that the
land owner notify the agency ``at least 10 days in advance of changing the land use to allow salvage of such a plant''
(Native Plant Protection Act, Chapter 10 Section 1913). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Environmental Quality Act ((CEQA) Public Resources Code Sections 21000&hyph;21177) requires a
full disclosure of the potential environmental impacts of proposed projects. The public agency with primary authority
or jurisdiction over the project is designated as the lead agency, and is responsible for conducting a review of the
project and consulting with the other agencies concerned with the resources affected by the project. Section 15065
of the CEQA Guidelines, as amended, requires a finding of significance if a project has the potential to ``reduce the
number or restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal.'' Species that are eligible for listing as rare,
threatened, or endangered, but are not so listed, are given the same protection as those species that are officially
listed with the State or Federal governments. Once significant effects are identified, the lead agency has the option
to require mitigation for effects through changes in the project or to decide that overriding considerations make
mitigation infeasible (CEQA Section 21002). In the latter case, projects may be approved that cause significant
environmental damage, such as destruction of endangered species. Protection of listed species through CEQA is,
therefore, dependant upon the discretion of the agency involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because vernal pools are generally small and scattered, they are treated as isolated wetlands or waters of the United
States for regulatory purposes by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Clean Water Act regulates discharge of fill material into wetlands but does not itself protect the plants. Nationwide
Permit No. 26 (33 CFR part 330.5 (a)(26)) was established by the Corps to facilitate issuance of permits for discharge
of fill into wetlands up to 4 ha (10 ac). For project proposals falling under Nationwide Permit No. 26, the Corps has
been reluctant to withhold authorization unless a federally listed threatened or endangered species is known to
be present, regardless of the significance of other wetland resources. The section 404 regulations require an applicant
to obtain an individual permit to fill isolated wetlands or waters greater than 4 ha (10 ac). A project proponent affecting
wetland fill of less than one acre is only required to notify the Corps of their intent to fill wetlands. Compensatory
mitigation generally is not required for projects affecting less than one acre. In either case, candidate species
receive no special consideration. Additionally and equally important, upland watersheds are not provided any protection.
Disturbance to or loss of pool hydrological conditions has damaged populations and habitat as discussed previously
in Factor A. Reductions in water volume and inundation adversely affect all four plants. Thus, as a consequence of
the small scale of vernal pools and lack of protection of associated uplands, these vernal pools receive insufficient
protection.

Parvisedum leiocarpum
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 from three sites. All four species occupy highly restricted and vulnerable habitats. The combination of low populations,
narrow range, and restriction and vulnerability of habitat make these plants susceptible to destruction of all or
a significant part of any population from random natural events such as flood, drought, disease, or other natural
occurrences. Low population numbers also make the populations vulnerable to genetic variations. Changes in gene
frequency, inbreeding, and genetic drift can result from populations becoming genetically depauperate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past,
present, and future threats faced by these species in determining to propose this rule. Based on this evaluation,
the preferred action is to list

 as endangered. Endangered status is appropriate for these four species due to the vulnerability of their restrictive
habitats, threats posed to those habitats by urbanization, agricultural land conversion, drainage, road widening,
off-highway vehicle use, stochastic events, and inadequate regulatory mechanisms. Critical habitat is not proposed
for these species for reasons discussed below.

Critical Habitat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate
critical habitat concurrently with determining a species to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that
the designation of critical habitat is not prudent for these species at this time. Because the four species face numerous
anthropogenic threats (see Factors A, B, and E in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species'') and occur predominantly
on private land, Federal actions affecting these species are limited. Designating critical habitat would not provide
any additional protection to the species. The publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in
the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 may make the plants even more vulnerable to incidents of vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to the decline
of the four plant species. Thus, designation of critical habitat would not be beneficial and is accordingly, not prudent.
Responsible agencies will be notified of the importance of protecting the habitat of the species. Protection of the
species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery process and, under limited circumstances, through the section
7 consultation process.

Available Conservation Measures

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Act include recognition,
recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition
through listing encourages and results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies, groups,
and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the State and requires that
recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions
against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7(a) of the Act requires Federal agencies to evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed
or listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations
implementing this interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(4) of
the Act requires Federal agencies to confer informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize
the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical
habitat. If a species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities
they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy
or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or its critical habitat,
the responsible Federal agency must enter into formal consultation with the Service.

 as endangered would provide for development of a recovery plan (or plans) for them. Such plan(s) would bring together
both State and Federal efforts for conservation of the plants. The recovery plan(s) would establish a framework for
agencies to coordinate activities and cooperate with each other in conservation efforts. The plan(s) would set recovery
priorities and estimate costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish them. It also would describe site-specific
management actions necessary to achieve conservation and survival of these four plants. Additionally, pursuant
to section 6 of the Act, the Service would be more likely to grant funds to affected states for management actions promoting
the protection and recovery of these species.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62, and 17.63 for endangered plant species set forth
a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangered plants. With respect to the four plants
from the four counties in northern California, all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) of the Act, implemented
by 50 CFR 17.61, would apply. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction
of the United States to import or export; deliver, receive, carry, transport, or ship in interstate or foreign commerce
in the course of a commercial activity; sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce; or remove and reduce
to possession federally listed plant species from areas under Federal jurisdiction; maliciously damage or destroy
any such plant species on any area under Federal jurisdiction; or remove, cut, dig up, damage, or destroy any such plant
species on any other area in knowing violation of any State law or regulation or in the course of any violation of a State
criminal trespass law. Seeds from cultivated specimens of threatened plant taxa are exempt from these prohibitions
provided that a statement ``of cultivated origin'' appears on the shipping containers. Certain exceptions apply
to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance
of permits to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered or threatened plant species under
certain circumstances. The Service anticipates few trade permits would ever be sought or issued for the four species
because the plants are not common in cultivation or in the wild. Requests for copies of the regulations on listed plants
and inquiries regarding them may be addressed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Ecological Services, Endangered
Species Permits, 911 N.E. 11th Avenue, Portland, Oregon 97232&hyph;4181 (503/231&hyph;6241; FAX 503/231&hyph;6243).

The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;355, provides authorities that streamline the
acquisition process and minimize burdensome Government-unique requirements. Major changes that can be expected
in the acquisition process as a result of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act implementation include changes
in the areas of Commercial Item Acquisition, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Truth in Negotiations Act,
and Introduction of the Federal Acquisition Computer Network.
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice announces proposed FAR revisions developed under FAR Case 94&hyph;751, Penalties on Unallowable Indirect
Costs, involving Sections 2101 and 2151 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 which change the contract
value threshold for assessment of penalties on unallowable costs from $100,000 to $500,000 and expand the coverage
from only the Department of Defense to all executive agencies. The proposed rule applies to all executive agencies
and recognizes the increase in the contract value threshold for inclusion of the contract clause. With the exception
of the threshold value, the penalty provisions in the new law are the same as those implemented in the current Defense
Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement. Since there are interactions between this proposed rule and the new
rule proposed under FAR case 94&hyph;752 to create a new subsection 42.703&hyph;2, the two rules should be read together
to fully understand the changes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAR Council is interested in an exchange of ideas and opinions with respect to the regulatory implementation of
the Act. For that reason, the FAR Council is conducting a series of public meetings. However, the FAR Council has not
scheduled a public meeting on this rule (FAR case 94&hyph;751) because of the clarity and non-controversial nature
of the rule. If the public believes such a meeting is needed with respect to this rule, a letter requesting a public meeting
and outlining the nature of the requested meeting shall be submitted to and received by the FAR Secretariat (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 caption) on or before January 18, 1995. The FAR Council will consider such requests in determining whether a public
meeting on this rule should be scheduled.

B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitles
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., because most contracts awarded to small businesses are awarded through sealed bidding on a firm-fixed price basis.
The penalty provisions apply only to contracts which are not firm-fixed price. Also, the proposed rule would only
apply to contracts in excess of $500,000, eliminating the impact on contracts below that threshold. An Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected
FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately
and should cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (FAR case 94&hyph;751), in correspondence.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information
collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which
require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Certain contracts require certification of the indirect cost rates proposed for progress or billing payment purposes.
If unallowable costs are included in final indirect cost settlement proposals, penalties may be assessed. See 42.703&hyph;2
and 42.709 for administrative procedures regarding the certification and penalty assessment provisions and for
related contract clause prescriptions.

(a) The following penalties apply to contracts covered by this section:
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) If the indirect cost is expressly unallowable under a cost principle in the FAR, or an executive agency supplement
to the FAR, that defines the allowability of specific selected costs, the penalty is equal to_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The amount of the disallowed costs allocated to contracts that are subject to this section for which an indirect
cost proposal has been submitted, plus
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Interest on the paid portion, if any, of the disallowance.
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) If the indirect cost was determined to be unallowable for that contractor before proposal submission, the penalty
is two times the amount in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) These penalties are in addition to other administrative, civil, and criminal penalties provided by law.
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) A DCAA Form 1, Notice of Contract Costs Suspended and/or Disapproved (see 48 CFR 242.705&hyph;2 [Defense FAR Supplement,

notice;
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A contracting officer final decision which was not appealed;
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A prior executive agency Board of Contract Appeals or court decision involving the contractor, which upheld the
cost disallowance; or
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A determination or agreement of unallowability under 31.201&hyph;6.
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Issue a final decision (see 33.211) which includes a demand for payment of any penalty assessed under paragraphs
(a) or (b) of this section. The letter shall state that the determination is a final decision under the Disputes clause
of the contract. (Demanding payment of the penalty is separate from demanding repayment of any paid portion of the
disallowed cost.)

For 42.709&hyph;1(a)(1)(ii), compute interest on any paid portion of the disallowed cost as follows:
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Consider the overpayment to have occurred, and interest to have begun accumulating, from the midpoint of the contractor's
fiscal year. Use an alternate equitable method if the cost was not paid evenly over the fiscal year.
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Use the interest rate specified by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to Pub. L. 92&hyph;41 (85 Stat. 97).
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Compute interest from the date of overpayment to the date of the demand letter for payment of the penalty.
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The cognizant contracting officer shall waive the penalties at 42.709&hyph;1(a) when_
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The contractor withdraws the proposal before the Government formally initiates an audit of the proposal and the
contractor submits a revised proposal (An audit will be deemed to be formally initiated when the Government provides
the contractor with written notice that audit work on a specific final indirect cost proposal has begun or the Government
holds an audit entrance conference with the contractor.);
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The amount of the unallowable costs under the proposal which are subject to the penalty is $10,000 or less (i.e.,
if the amount of expressly or previously determined unallowable costs allocable to the contracts specified in 42.709(b)
is $10,000 or less); or
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The contractor demonstrates, to the cognizant contracting officer's satisfaction, that_
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) It has established policies and personnel training and an internal control and review system that provide assurance
that unallowable costs subject to penalties are precluded from being included in the contractor's final indirect
cost rate proposals (e.g., the types of controls required for satisfactory participation in the Department of Defense
sponsored self-governance programs, specific accounting controls over indirect costs, compliance tests which
demonstrate that the controls are effective, and Government audits which have not disclosed recurring instances
of expressly unallowable costs); and
<!-- PJG 0011 horztab -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The unallowable costs subject to the penalty were inadvertently incorporated into the proposal; i.e., their
inclusion resulted from an unintentional error, notwithstanding the exercise of due care.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This proposed rule is issued pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (the Act) to implement the
requirements for contractor certification of indirect costs. Section 2151 of the Act amended Section 306 of the Federal
Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 256). This provision extended to the civilian agencies
the same certification of indirect costs which is currently applicable to Department of Defense (DoD) contracts,
pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2324(h). This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under
Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993.

A. Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Act, Pub. L. 103&hyph;355, provides authorities that streamline the acquisition process and minimize burdensome
government-unique requirements. Major changes that can be expected in the acquisition process as a result of the
Act's implementation include changes in the areas of Commercial Item Acquisition, Simplified Acquisition Procedures,
the Truth in Negotiations Act, and introduction of the Federal Acquisition Computer Network (FACNET).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice announces FAR revisions developed under FAR case 94&hyph;752, which was based on provision in the Act
that extended to the civilian agencies the same certification of indirect costs which is currently applicable to
DoD contracts, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2324(h).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAR Council is interested in an exchange of ideas and opinions with respect to the regulatory implementation of
the Act. For that reason, the FAR Council is conducting a series of public meetings. However, the FAR Council has not
scheduled a public meeting on this rule (FAR case 94&hyph;752) because of the clarity and non-controversial nature
of the rule. If the public believes such a meeting is needed with respect to this rule, a letter requesting a public meeting
and outlining the nature of the requested meeting shall be submitted to and received by the FAR Secretariat (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 caption, above) on or before January 18, 1995. The FAR Council will consider such requests in determining whether
a public meeting on this rule should be scheduled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities
within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., because the percentage of actions awarded to small business that will be affected by this rule is estimated to be
less than 1% of the total of such actions. Most actions awarded to small business are firm-fixed price actions awarded
on a competitive basis. The cost principles and requirements to submit indirect cost rate proposals generally apply
only when certified cost or pricing data are required. The vast preponderance of actions awarded to small business
do not require submittal of either cost or pricing data nor an indirect cost rate proposal. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subparts
will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and should
cite 5 U.S.C. 601, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

C. Paperwork Reduction Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose additional recordkeeping
or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members
of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to a request by a petitioner and a respondent, the Department of Commerce (the Department) is conducting
an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on chrome-plated lug nuts from Taiwan. The review covers seven
firms and the period September 1, 1992, through August 31, 1993. The review indicates the existence of margins for
the firms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of this review, we preliminarily determine to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between
United States price and foreign market value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.

On September 20, 1991, the Department published the antidumping duty order on chrome-plated lug nuts from Taiwan.
The Department published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' on September 7, 1993 (58 FR
47116). The petitioner, Consolidated International Automotive, Inc. (Consolidated), and a respondent, Gourmet
Equipment (Taiwan) Corporation (Gourmet), requested that we conduct an administrative review for the period September
1, 1992, through August 31, 1993. We published a notice of ``Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative
Review'' on October 18, 1993 (58 FR 53710), for the following firms: Buxton International, Gourmet, Chu Fong Metallic
Industrial Corporation (Chu Fong), San Chien Electric Industrial Works, Ltd. (San Chien), Everspring Plastic Corp.
(Everspring), Kuang Hong Industries Co., Ltd. (Kuang), and Transcend International Co. (Transcend). Questionnaires
were sent to Buxton, Everspring, Kuang, Transcend, Gourmet, Chu Fong, and San Chien. Everspring responded that it
has never sold the subject merchandise. Only Gourmet and Buxton responded to the questionnaire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has now conducted the administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930,
as amended (the Tariff Act).

Scope of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise covered by this review is one-piece and two-piece chrome-plated lug nuts, finished or unfinished,
which are more than 11/16 inches (17.45 millimeters) in height and which have a hexagonal (hex) size of at least 3/4
inches (19.05 millimeters). The term ``unfinished'' refers to unplated and/or unassembled chrome-plated lug nuts.
The subject merchandise is used for securing wheels to cars, vans, trucks, utility vehicles, and trailers. Zinc-plated
lug nuts, finished or unfinished, and stainless-steel capped lug nuts are not in the scope of this review. Chrome-plated
lock nuts are also not in the scope of this review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the period of review (POR), chrome-plated lug nuts were provided for under subheading 7318.16.00.10 of the
Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Although the HTS subheading is provided for convenience and Customs purposes,
our written description of the scope of this review is dispositive.

Use of Best Information Available (BIA)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In deciding what to use as BIA, the Department's regulations provide that the Department may take into account whether
a party refuses to provide requested information (19 CFR 353.37(b)). Thus, the Department determines, on a case-by-case
basis, what constitutes BIA. For the purposes of these preliminary results, we applied the following two-tier BIA
analysis where we were unable to use a company's response for purposes of determining a dumping margin (

1. When a company refuses to cooperate with the Department or otherwise significantly impedes these proceedings,
we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest of the rates found for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in
the same country of origin in the less than fair value investigation (LTFV) or prior administrative reviews; or (2)
the highest rate found in this review for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise in the same country of origin.

2. When a company substantially cooperates with our requests for information and, substantially cooperates in verification,
but fails to provide the information requested in a timely manner or in the form required or was unable to substantiate
it, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the highest rate ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise
from either the LTFV investigation or a prior administrative review or if the firm has never before been investigated
or reviewed, the all others rate from the LTFV investigation; or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for
the class or kind of merchandise for any firm from the same country of origin.

Chu Fong, Kuang, Transcend, and San Chien failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire. Accordingly, for
these companies we applied the first-tier BIA rate of 10.67 percent, which is the highest rate the Department found
in the original LTFV investigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Gourmet and Buxton provided us with responses to our questionnaires. However, the Department determined that the
data Gourmet submitted could not be reconciled to its audited financial statements. Reliance on the accounting system
used for the preparation of the audited financial statements is a key and vital part of the Department's determination
that a company's sales and constructed value data are credible. An ``in-house'' system which has not been audited
and is not used for the preparation of the financial statements or for any purpose other than internal deliberations
of the company does not assure the Department that such costs have been stated in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, or that all sales and costs have been appropriately captured by the ``in-house'' system (

to each firm.

Everspring responded that it never sold the subject merchandise, and we have no information to contradict this claim.
If Everspring begins to sell the subject merchandise, it entries will receive the ``all other rate'' cash deposit
rate until we conduct an administrative review upon request.

firms will be those firms' rates established in the final results of this administrative review; (2) for previously
reviewed or investigated companies not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific
rate published for the most recent period; (3) if the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a previous review,

to apply the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical
errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders for the purposes of establishing
cash deposit in all current and future administrative reviews. The ``all others'' rate in the LTFV investigation
was 6.93 percent.

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The review covers one exporter, the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board (NZKMB), and the period November 27, 1991,
through May 31, 1993. The Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results on May 6, 1994
(59 FR 23691) and the final results on September 22, 1994 (59 FR 48596) of its administrative review of the antidumping
duty order on fresh kiwifruit from New Zealand.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Review
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The product covered by the order under review is fresh kiwifruit. Processed kiwifruit, including fruit jams, jellies,
pastes, purees, mineral waters, or juices made from or containing kiwifruit, are not covered under the scope of the
order. The subject merchandise is currently classifiable under subheading 0810.90.20.60 of the Harmonized Tariff
Schedule (HTS). Although the HTS number is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description
of the scope of this review is dispositive.

Amendment of Final Results
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 18, 1994, NZKMB alleged that the Department made clerical errors in its final results of review. First,
NZKMB argued that the Department used an incorrect data set when calculating third-country weighted-average prices.
Second, NZKMB argued that in calculating foreign market value the Department used an incorrect amount for third-country
packing costs. Third, NZKMB argued that the Department failed to use the correct quantity adjustment information
for U.S. sales in its calculations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitioners, the California Kiwifruit Commission, have argued that the respondent's allegation of clerical errors
submitted on October 18, 1994, was untimely because it was based on a computer program provided at the disclosure on
October 5, 1994 (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
see
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 19 CFR 353.28(b)).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We disagree with petitioners that the respondent's submission alleging clerical error was untimely. The disclosure
documents released by the Department to the respondent on October 5, 1994, did not include the computer program for
the calculation of the weighted-average third-country price and therefore were incomplete. This computer program
was then provided to the respondent on October 11, 1994. Thus, full disclosure occurred on October 11, 1994. Therefore,
in accordance with 19 CFR 353.28(6), the deadline for submission of allegations of clerical errors regarding our
calculations was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
October 18, 1994. We received the respondent's allegation of clerical errors in a timely fashion on October 18, 1994,
and have therefore analyzed it and amended our calculations accordingly. Specifically, we: (1) Amended the calculations
to use the correct data set in the calculation of third-country weighted-average prices, (2) revised third-country
packing costs, (3) corrected the results for the quantity adjustment information for U.S. sales.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to a request by a respondent, the Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the
antidumping finding on racing plates from Canada. The review covers one firm and the period February 1, 1993, through
January 31, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have preliminarily determined that sales have been made below the foreign market value (FMV). If these preliminary
results are adopted in our final results of administrative review, we will instruct U.S. Customs to assess antidumping
duties equal to the difference between the United States price (USP) and the FMV.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On February 27, 1974 (39 FR 7579), the Department of Treasury published the antidumping finding of racing plates (aluminum
horseshoes) from Canada. The Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request
Administrative Review'' on February 4, 1994 (59 FR 5390). The respondent, Equine Forgings Limited, requested that
we conduct an administrative review for the period February 1, 1993, through January 31, 1994. We published a notice
of ``Initiation of Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Administrative Review'' on March 14, 1994 (59 FR 11769) for
Equine Forgings Limited. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department has now conducted the administrative review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930,
as amended (the Tariff Act).

Scope of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by the review are shipments of racing plates (horseshoes) that are made of aluminum, may have cleats
or caulks, and come in a variety of sizes. They are used on race horses, polo, jumping, hunting, and other performing
horses, as differentiated from pleasure and work horses. During the review period such merchandise was classifiable
under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number 7616.90.00. This HTS item number is provided for convenience
and customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In calculating USP, the Department used purchased price, as defined in section 772 of the Tariff Act, since sales to
the first unrelated purchaser were made prior to the date of importation. Purchase price was based on the packed f.o.b.
price to unrelated purchasers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for inland freight, U.S.
duty, and brokerage/handling charges. We adjusted USP for taxes in accordance with our practice as outlined in

In calculating FMV, we used home market price, as defined in section 773 of the Tariff Act, since sufficient quantities
of such or similar merchandise were sold in the home market to provide a basis for comparison. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Home market price was based upon the packed f.o.b. price to unrelated purchasers in Canada, with appropriate deductions
for rebates. We adjusted for Canadian value-added tax in accordance with our decision

The Ad Hoc Committee of AZ&hyph;NM&hyph;TX&hyph;FL Producers of Grey Portland Cement v. United States, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
No. 93&hyph;1239, (January 5, 1994), we no longer deduct home market movement expenses from FMV pursuant to the Department's
inherent power to fill in gaps in the antidumping statute. Accordingly, we now adjust for such expenses under the circumstance-of-sale
provision of 19 CFR 352.56 and the ESP offset provision of 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1)(2), as appropriate. As a result, we have
not adjusted for Equine Forging's reported home market inland freight as movement expenses. Rather, we have treated
Equine Forging's reported post-sale inland freight as a direct selling expense, which we have deducted from FMV.

The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries.
Upon completion of this review, the Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to the U.S. Customs
Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the following deposit requirements will be effective for all shipments of the subject merchandise,
entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the publication date of the final results of this
administrative review, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act: (1) The cash deposit rate for the reviewed
firm will be that firm's rate established in the final results of this administrative review. If the rate in the final
results of review for Equine Forgings Limited is 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
de minimis,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 there will be no cash deposits required on shipments from this firm. (2) For previously reviewed or investigated companies
not listed above, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate published for the most recent
period. (3) If the exporter is not a firm covered in this review, a previous review, or the original less than fair value
(LTFV) investigation, but the manufacturer is, the cash deposit rate will be the rate established for the most recent
period for the manufacturer of the merchandise.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
United States,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Slip Op. 93&hyph;83, decided that once an ``all others'' rate is established for a company, it can only be changed through
an administrative review. The Department has determined that in order to implement these decisions, it is appropriate
to apply the original ``all others'' rate from the LTFV investigation (or that rate as amended for correction of clerical
errors or as a result of litigation) in proceedings governed by antidumping duty orders for the purposes of establishing
cash deposits in all current and future administrative reviews. In proceedings governed by antidumping findings,
unless we are able to ascertain the ``all others'' rate from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the Department has determined
that it is appropriate to adopt the ``new shipper'' rate established in the first final results of administrative
review published by the Department (or that rate amended for correction of clerical errors or as a result of litigation)
as the ``all others'' rate for the purpose of establishing cash deposits in all current and future administrative
reviews.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this proceeding is governed by an antidumping finding and we are unable to ascertain the ``all others'' rate
from the Treasury LTFV investigation, the ``all others'' rate for purposes of this review will be 6.77 percent, the
``new shipper'' rate established in the final results of administrative review published by the Department (47 FR
51779, November 17, 1982). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These deposit requirements, when imposed, shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next
administrative review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice, and a hearing within
10 days of the date of publication. Any hearing requested will be held as early as convenient for parties but no later
than 44 days after the date of publication, or the first workday thereafter. Case briefs, or other written comments,
from interested parties may be submitted not later than 30 days after the date of publication of this notice. Rebuttal
briefs and rebuttal comments, limited to issues raised in the case briefs, may be filed not later than 37 days after
the date of publication. The Department will publish the final results of review, including its results of its analysis
of issues raised in any such written comments or at a hearing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1))
and 19 CFR 353.22.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 49643) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on steel wire nails from New Zealand (52 FR 37196; October
5, 1987). Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest
to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation and no interested
party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Within the specified time frame, we received objections from domestic interested parties to our intent to revoke
this countervailing duty order. Therefore, because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met,
we will not revoke this order.

new limit established for Categories 352/652 for the period December 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994 has been adjusted

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Interagency Coordinating Council (FICC) is established under section 685 of the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act, as amended (20 U.S.C. 1484a). The Council is established to: (1) Minimize duplication across Federal,
State and local agencies of programs and activities relating to early intervention services for infants and toddlers
with disabilities and their families and preschool services for children with disabilities; (2) ensure effective
coordination of Federal early intervention and preschool programs, including Federal technical assistance and
support activities; and (3) identify gaps in Federal agency programs and services and barriers to Federal interagency
cooperation. To meet these purposes, the FICC seeks to: (1) Identify areas of conflict, overlap, and omissions in
interagency policies related to the provision of services to infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with disabilities;
(2) develop and implement joint policy interpretations on issues related to infants, toddlers, and preschoolers
that cut across Federal agencies, including modifications of regulations to eliminate barriers to interagency
programs and activities; and (3) coordinate the provision of technical assistance and dissemination of best practice
information. The FICC is chaired by the Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Oak Ridge Operations Office, announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2),
it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on acceptance of an unsolicited application meeting
the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1) under Cooperative Agreement Number DE&hyph;FC05&hyph;950R22363 to the United
States Automotive Materials Partnership (USAMP). USAMP is a consortium of Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company,
and General Motors Corporation. The proposed cooperative agreement will provide estimated funding in the amount
of $1,660,000 by the DOE for a project entitled, ``Automotive Lightweight Materials Program''. The purpose of this
effort is to define and conduct pre-competitive, vehicle-related research and development (R&amp;D) in materials
and materials processing which will improve the competitiveness of the U.S. automotive industry. USAMP goals are
to develop several families of automotive materials that will impact strategic needs of the industry. These funds
will be matched equally by USAMP under this cooperative agreement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The DOE has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f), that the unsolicited application for financial assistance
submitted by USAMP, is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and that the proposed
project represents a unique idea, that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or
planned solicitation. The applicant is a consortium of the three largest automotive manufacturers in the United
States. These competitive companies have come together as several consortia under the United States Council for
Automotive Research (USCAR) to work together to jointly advance ``precompetitive'' automotive technologies.

Take notice that on December 9, 1994, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company (Williston Basin), tendered for
filing in response to the November 30, 1994, Letter Order issued in the above-referenced docket, Substitute First
Revised Sheet No. 243 to Second Revised Volume No. 1 of its FERC Gas Tariff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Williston Basin states that in the November 30 Letter Order, the Commission rejected Williston Basin's proposed
deletion of certain language in First Revised Sheet No. 243. Williston Basin states that on the apparent assumption
that the only change contained in First Revised Sheet No. 243 was the deletion of that language, the Letter Order rejected
the entirety of the sheet. However, it states, that sheet also contained changes that were necessitated by the changes
made to the tariff sheets that were accepted by the Letter Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Williston Basin states that it is resubmitting the tariff sheet in question with the previously stricken language
included along with the changes necessary to conform Sheet No. 243 with the accepted tariff sheets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825
North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice
and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before December 20, 1994. Protests will be considered
by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make the protestants parties
to the proceeding. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order set
out below. The Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute
a total of $10,700,000, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of the Consent Order entered into
with Murphy on July 15, 1994. These funds were paid towards the settlement of alleged violations of the DOE petroleum
price and allocation regulations that were in effect from August 19, 1973, through January 28, 1981. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OHA has proposed to distribute these funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary
Policy in Crude Oil Cases, 51 FR 27,899 (August 4, 1986)(the MSRP). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are
divided between the federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds
to the states would be distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during the price
control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers would be based on the volume of petroleum products they purchased
and the degree to which they can demonstrate injury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting parties
are requested to provide two copies of their submissions. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publication
of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and should be sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. All comments received in this proceeding
will be available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal
holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in Room 1E&hyph;234, 1000 Independence

On October 25, 1994 the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition
for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), to distribute
$10,700,000 remitted by Murphy Oil Corp., Murphy Oil USA, Inc., and Murphy Exploration &amp; Production Co. (collectively
referred to as ``Murphy''), pursuant to the Consent Order entered into between Murphy and the DOE on July 15, 1994.
In accordance with the procedural regulations codified at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V (Subpart V), the ERA requests
in its Petition that the OHA establish special procedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects of alleged
regulatory violations which were resolved by the present Consent Order. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth
the OHA's plan to distribute these funds.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Murphy is a major integrated refiner which produced and sold crude oil and a full range of refined petroleum products
during the period of federal price controls. As such, it was subject to the federal petroleum price and allocation
regulations. During that time, the ERA conducted an extensive audit of Murphy and issued an issue letter to Murphy
on September 29, 1976. ERA issued a Notice of Probable Violation to Murphy on January 28, 1981. ERA issued a Proposed
Remedial Order (PRO) to Murphy on December 15, 1986, which Murphy contested before the OHA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 On February 9, 1987, Murphy and the DOE entered into a Consent Order which resolved disputes regarding Murphy's refined
petroleum product operations during the period the petroleum price and allocation regulations were in effect. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Murphy Oil Corp.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 17 DOE &para;85,782 (1987) (the first Consent Order). The first Consent Order left the issue of Murphy's alleged violations
as a producer of crude oil unresolved. Those issues were decided by the OHA on June 17, 1992 when the OHA issued a modified
version of ERA's PRO as a Remedial Order (RO). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See Murphy Oil Corp.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 22 DOE &para;83,005 (1992). Murphy subsequently appealed the OHA's determination to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC). On January 24, 1994 a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued a Decision and Proposed Order (D&amp;PO)
which modified the RO.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 On July 15, 1994, Murphy and the DOE entered into the present Consent Order, the second between Murphy and the DOE. This
second Consent Order, which does not modify or affect the terms of the first Consent Order, resolves all existing or
potential civil and administrative claims against Murphy for alleged violations of the federal petroleum price
and allocation regulations left unresolved by the first Consent Order. Under the terms of this second Consent Order,
Murphy has remitted $10,700,000 to the DOE, and all outstanding or potential claims by the DOE against Murphy have
been extinguished. These funds are being held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at the Department
of the Treasury pending a determination regarding their proper distribution.

The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing
a plan of distribution for funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart
V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion
procedures to distribute refunds,

We propose to distribute the Murphy funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy
in Crude Oil Cases, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (the MSRP). The MSRP was issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement
Agreement.

 653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para;90,509 (1986) (the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement).
The MSRP establishes that 40 percent of the crude oil overcharge funds will be remitted to the federal government,
another 40 percent to the states, and up to 20 percent may be initially reserved for the payment of claims by injured
parties. The MSRP also specifies that any monies remaining after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid be
disbursed to the federal government and the states in equal amounts.

 Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986). This Order provided a period of 30 days for the filing of
comments or objections to our proposed use of the MSRP as the groundwork for evaluating claims in crude oil refund proceedings.
Following this period, the OHA issued a Notice evaluating the numerous comments which it received pursuant to the
Order Implementing the MSRP. This Notice was published at 52 FR 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April 10 Notice). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The April 10 Notice contained guidance to assist potential claimants wishing to file refund applications for crude
oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. Generally, all claimants would be required to (1) document their purchase
volumes of petroleum products during the August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981 crude oil price control period,
and (2) prove that they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. We also specified that end-users of petroleum
products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry will be presumed to have been injured by the alleged
crude oil overcharges and need not submit any additional proof of injury beyond documentation of their purchase volumes.

See City of Columbus, Georgia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 16 DOE &para;85,550 (1987). Additionally, we stated that crude oil refunds would be calculated on the basis of a per
gallon (or ``volumetric'') refund amount, which is obtained by dividing the crude oil refund pool by the total consumption
of petroleum products in the United States during the crude oil price control period. The OHA has adopted the refund
procedures outlined in the April 10 Notice in numerous cases.

We propose to adopt the DOE's standard crude oil refund procedures to distribute the monies remitted by Murphy. We
have chosen initially to reserve 20 percent of the fund, plus accrued interest, for direct refunds to claimants in
order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for injured parties. This reserve figure may later be reduced
if circumstances warrant.

 It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims at the rate of $.0008 per gallon. While we anticipate that
applicants that filed their claims before June 30, 1988 will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide
in the future whether claimants that filed later applications should receive additional refunds.

Under the terms of the MSRP, we propose that the remaining eighty percent of the alleged crude oil overcharge amounts
subject to this Proposed Decision, plus accrued interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and the
federal government for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum
products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive
is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement, 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines &para;90,509 at 90,687.
When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements as all other crude

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Section 113(g) of the Clean Air Act (``Act''), notice is hereby given of a proposed settlement agreement
concerning litigation instituted against the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') by Edward M. Ober, through
his counsel David S. Baron of the Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest (hereafter ``ACLPI''). The lawsuit
concerns EPA's alleged failure to perform a nondiscretionary duty with respect to promulgating a PM&hyph;10 final
implementation plan (``FIP'') for the Phoenix, Arizona Planning Area. The proposed settlement agreement provides
that EPA shall sign a Notice of Final Rulemaking (``NFRM'' regarding the moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10
State implementation plan (``SIP'') submitted by the State of Arizona for the Phoenix Planning Area, respecting
which a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPRM'') was published at 59 FR 38402 (July 28, 1994), no later than March 1,
1995. If final rulemaking action by EPA results in disapproval of the SIP, in whole or in part, EPA would agree to sign
a NFRM promulgating a FIP that corrects the disapproved portions of the SIP no later than March 1, 1996, unless prior
to that date EPA has fully approved a SIP revision that corrects the deficiency that formed the basis for the disapproval
action. If EPA takes final rulemaking action approving the SIP, in whole or in part, the parties will file a joint motion
to stay litigation in the district court pending the outcome of appellate review. Additionally, it after appellate
review EPA's approval is vacated, the parties will file a joint motion to lift the stay, and plaintiffs would be free
to pursue litigation of their original FIP claims without being required to file an addtional 60-day notice of intent
to sue or a new complaint. If, however, EPA is upheld on appellate review, plaintiffs shall, within 30 days, file a motion
to dismiss or withdraw their complaint. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For a period of thirty [30] days following the date of publication of this notice, the Agency will receive written comments
relating to the settlement agreement. EPA or the Department of Justice may withhold or withdraw consent to the proposed
settlement agreement in the comments disclose facts or circumstances that indicate that such consent is inappropriate,
improper, inadequate, or inconsistent with the requirements of the Act.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Section 4005(c)(1)(B) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid
Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, 42 U.S.C. 6945 (c)(1)(B), requires States to develop and implement regulatory programs
to ensure that municipal solid waste landfill facilities (MSWLFs) which may receive hazardous household waste or
small quantity generator hazardous waste will comply with the revised federal MSWLF criteria, codified at 40 CFR
Part 258 (the Federal MSWLF Criteria). Section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C), requires the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate regulatory programs for MSWLFs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Approved State MSWLF programs provide interaction between the State and MSWLF owners and operators regarding site-specific
approval conditions. Only owners or operators located in States with approved programs can use the site-specific
flexibility provided by 40 CFR Part 258 to the extent the state program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that the
Federal MSWLF Criteria apply to all MSWLFs, regardless of the approval status of any state program or individual facility.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Arizona applied for a determination of adequacy under Section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed Arizona's application and
issued for public comment a tentative determination that Arizona's program is adequate to ensure compliance with
the revised MSWLF criteria. Based on a thorough review of Arizona's MSWLF program and the fact that the only comments
EPA received supported the tentative determination, EPA is today issuing a final determination that Arizona's MSWLF
program is adequate.

A. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated the Federal MSWLF Criteria, codified at 40 CFR part 258. Subtitle D of RCRA, 42 U.S.C.
6941&hyph;6949(a), as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires States to develop
regulatory programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal MSWLF Criteria. Section 4005 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C.
6945, also requires that EPA determine the adequacy of State MSWLF programs to ensure that facilities comply with
the Federal MSWLF Criteria. To facilitate this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing
a State and Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially
approve, State and Tribal landfill regulatory programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has approved, and will continue to approve, State MSWLF programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. Prior to
the promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will continue to be made on the basis of statutory authorities
and requirements. EPA interprets the statutory requirements for States to develop ``adequate'' regulatory programs
to impose several minimum standards. First, each State must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs
that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Next, the State must have the authority to issue
a permit or other notice of prior approval to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State also must provide
for public participation in facility approval and enforcement as required in Section 7004(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6974(b).
Finally, the State must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific
action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA Regions will determine whether a State has submitted an ``adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined
above. EPA expects States to meet all of the criteria for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval
to a MSWLF program. In addition, States may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 6, 1994, Arizona submitted an application for program adequacy determination. On September 15, 1994, EPA published
a tentative determination of adequacy for all portions of Arizona's program. Further background on the tentative
determination of adequacy appears at 59 FR 47332 (September 15, 1994).

Along with the tentative determination, EPA announced the availability of the application for public comment. EPA
received two comments supporting the determination, but no requests for a public meeting.

B. Decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the tentative determination, EPA proposed to fully approve Arizona's MSWLF program. Arizona's application for
adequacy determination meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. The State of
Arizona has the authority to enforce the requirements of its MSWLF program at all MSWLFs in the State, with the exception
of those located on Tribal Lands. Accordingly, Arizona is granted a determination of adequacy for all portions of
its MSWLF program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to enforcement by the States, Section 4005(a) of RCRA provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions
of Section 7002 of RCRA to enforce the Federal MSWLF Criteria at 40 CFR part 258 independent of any state enforcement
program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying
with provisions in a state program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the federal criteria.
See 56 FR 50978, 50995 (October 9, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Today's action takes effect on the date of publication. EPA believes it has good cause under section 553(d) of the Administrative
Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C 553(d), to put this action into effect less than 30 days after publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. All of the requirements and obligations in the State's MSWLF program are already in effect as a matter of state law.
EPA's action today does not impose any new requirements on the regulated community, nor do these requirements become
enforceable by EPA as federal law. Consequently, EPA finds that it does not need to give notice prior to making its approval
effective.

Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic
impact on a substantial number of small entities. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore,
does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This Notice, pursuant to section 6(f)(2) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), 7 U.S.C.
136 et seq., announces that EPA has issued Notices of Intent to Suspend pursuant to sections 3(c)(2)(B) and 4 of FIFRA.
The Notices were issued following issuance of Section 4 Reregistration Requirements Notices by the Agency and the
failure of registrants subject to the Section 4 Reregistration Requirements Notices to take appropriate steps to
secure the data required to be submitted to the Agency. This Notice includes the text of a Notice of Intent to Suspend,
absent specific chemical, product, or factual information. Table A of this Notice further identifies the registrants
to whom the Notices of Intent to Suspend were issued, the date each Notice of Intent to Suspend was issued, the active
ingredient(s) involved, and the EPA registration numbers and names of the registered product(s) which are affected
by the Notices of Intent to Suspend. Moreover, Table B of this Notice identifies the basis upon which the Notices of
Intent to Suspend were issued. Finally, matters pertaining to the timing of requests for hearing are specified in
the Notices of Intent to Suspend and are governed by the deadlines specified in section 3(c)(2)(B). As required by
section 6(f)(2), the Notices of Intent to Suspend were sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each affected
registrant at its address of record.

Dear Sir/Madam:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This letter gives you notice that the pesticide product registrations listed in Attachment I will be suspended 30
days from your receipt of this letter unless you take steps within that time to prevent this Notice from automatically
becoming a final and effective order of suspension. The Agency's authority for suspending the registrations of your
products is section 3(c)(2)(B) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Upon becoming
a final and effective order of suspension, any violation of the order will be an unlawful act under section 12(a)(2)(J)
of FIFRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You are receiving this Notice of Intent to Suspend because you have failed to comply with the terms of the Phase 5 Registration
Eligibility Document Data Call-In Notice imposed pursuant to section 4(g)(2)(b) and section 3(c)(2)(B) of FIFRA.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific basis for issuance of this Notice is stated in the Explanatory Appendix (Attachment III) to this Notice.
Affected products and the requirements which you failed to satisfy are listed and described in the following three
attachments:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attachment I Suspension Report - Product List
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attachment II Suspension Report - Requirement List
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attachment III Suspension Report - Explanatory Appendix
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suspension of the registration of each product listed in Attachment I will become final unless at least one of the
following actions is completed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. You may avoid suspension under this Notice if you or another person adversely affected by this Notice properly request
a hearing within 30 days of your receipt of this Notice. If you request a hearing, it will be conducted in accordance
with the requirements of section 6(d) of FIFRA and the Agency's procedural regulations in 40 CFR part 164.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3(c)(2)(B), however, provides that the only allowable issues which may be addressed at the hearing are whether
you have failed to take the actions which are the bases of this Notice and whether the Agency's decision regarding the
disposition of existing stocks is consistent with FIFRA. Therefore, no substantive allegation or legal argument
concerning other issues, including but not limited to the Agency's original decision to require the submission of
data or other information, the need for or utility of any of the required data or other information or deadlines imposed,
and the risks and benefits associated with continued registration of the affected product, may be considered in the
proceeding. The Administrative Law Judge shall by order dismiss any objections which have no bearing on the allowable
issues which may be considered in the proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3(c)(2)(B)(iv) of FIFRA provides that any hearing must be held and a determination issued within 75 days after
receipt of a hearing request. This 75&hyph;day period may not be extended unless all parties in the proceeding stipulate
to such an extension. If a hearing is properly requested, the Agency will issue a final order at the conclusion of the
hearing governing the suspension of your products.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing pursuant to this Notice must (1) include specific objections which pertain to the allowable
issues which may be heard at the hearing, (2) identify the registrations for which a hearing is requested, and (3) set
forth all necessary supporting facts pertaining to any of the objections which you have identified in your request
for a hearing. If a hearing is requested by any person other than the registrant, that person must also state specifically
why he asserts that he would be adversely affected by the suspension action described in this Notice. Three copies
of the request must be submitted to: Hearing Clerk, Mail Code 1900, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St.,
SW., Washington, DC 20460, and an additional copy should be sent to the signatory listed below. The request must be

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
received
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 by the Hearing Clerk by the 30th day from your receipt of this Notice in order to be legally effective. The 30&hyph;day
time limit is established by FIFRA and cannot be extended for any reason. Failure to meet the 30&hyph;day time limit
will result in automatic suspension of your registration(s) by operation of law and, under such circumstances, the
suspension of the registration for your affected product(s) will be final and effective at the close of business 30
days after your receipt of this Notice and will not be subject to further administrative review.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency's Rules of Practice at 40 CFR 164.7 forbid anyone who may take part in deciding this case, at any stage of the
proceeding, from discussing the merits of the proceeding 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with any party or with any person who has been connected with the preparation or presentation of the proceeding as an
advocate or in any investigative or expert capacity, or with any of their representatives. Accordingly, the following
EPA offices, and the staffs thereof, are designated as judicial staff to perform the judicial function of EPA in any
administrative hearings on this Notice of Intent to Suspend: The Office of the Administrative Law Judges, the Office
of the Judicial Officer, the Administrator, the Deputy Administrator, and the members of the staff in the immediate
offices of the Administrator and Deputy Administrator. None of the persons designated as the judicial staff shall
have any 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ex parte
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 communication with trial staff or any other interested person not employed by EPA on the merits of any of the issues
involved in this proceeding, without fully complying with the applicable regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. You may also avoid suspension if, within 30 days of your receipt of this Notice, the Agency determines that you have
taken appropriate steps to comply with the Section 4 Phase 5 Reregistration Eligibility Document Data Call-In Notice
requirements. In order to avoid suspension under this option, you must satisfactorily comply with Attachment II,
Requirement List, for each product by submitting all required supporting data/information described in Attachment
II and in the Explanatory Appendix (Attachment III) to the following address (preferably by certified mail):
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
Office of Compliance, Agriculture and Ecosystems Division, Mail Code 2225A, Environmental Protection Agency,
401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For you to avoid automatic suspension under this Notice, the Agency must also determine within the applicable 30&hyph;day
period that you have satisfied the requirements that are the bases of this Notice and so notify you in writing. You should
submit the necessary data/information as quickly as possible for there to be any chance the Agency will be able to make
the necessary determination in time to avoid suspension of your product(s).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The suspension of the registration(s) of your company's product(s) pursuant to this Notice will be rescinded when
the Agency determines you have complied fully with the requirements which were the bases of this Notice. Such compliance
may only be achieved by submission of the data/information described in the attachments to the signatory below.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Your product will remain suspended, however, until the Agency determines you are in compliance with the requirements
which are the bases of this Notice and so informs you in writing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After the suspension becomes final and effective, the registrant subject to this Notice, including all supplemental
registrants of product(s) listed in Attachment I, may not legally distribute, sell, use, offer for sale, hold for
sale, ship, deliver for shipment, or receive and (having so received) deliver or offer to deliver, to any person, the
product(s) listed in Attachment I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Persons other than the registrant subject to this Notice, as defined in the preceding sentence, may continue to distribute,
sell, use, offer for sale, hold for sale, ship, deliver for shipment, or receive and (having so received) deliver or
offer to deliver, to any person, the product(s) listed in Attachment I.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this Notice authorizes any person to distribute, sell, use, offer for sale, hold for sale, ship, deliver
for shipment, or receive and (having so received) deliver or offer to deliver, to any person, the product(s) listed
in Attachment I in any manner which would have been unlawful prior to the suspension.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the registrations of your products listed in Attachment I are currently suspended as a result of failure to comply
with another Section 4 Data Requirements Notice or Section 3(c)(2)(B) Data Call-In Notice, this Notice, when it becomes
a final and effective order of suspension, will be in addition to any existing suspension, i.e., all requirements
which are the bases of the suspension must be satisfied before the registration will be reinstated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
You are reminded that it is your responsibility as the basic registrant to notify all supplementary registered distributors
of your basic registered product that this suspension action also applies to their supplementary registered products
and that you may be held liable for violations committed by your distributors. If you have any questions about the requirements
and procedures set forth in this suspension notice or in the subject Section 4 Data Requirements Notice, please contact
Francisca Liem at (202) 564&hyph;2365.

On May 7, 1993, the EPA issued the Phase 5 Reregistration Eligibility Document Data Call-In Notice imposed pursuant
to section 4(g)(2)(B) and 3(c)(2)(B) of FIFRA which required registrants of products containing chlorinated isocyanurate
used as the active ingredient to develop and submit certain data. These data/information were determined to be necessary
to satisfy reregistration data requirements of section 4(g). Failure to comply with the requirements of a Phase 5
Reregistration Eligibility Document Data Call-In Notice is a basis for suspension under section 3(c)(2)(B) of FIFRA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Chlorinated Isocyanurate Phase 5 Reregistration Eligibility Document Data Call-In Notice dated May 7, 1993,
required each affected registrant to submit data/information to the Agency to address each of the data requirements.
Those data/information were required to be received by the Agency within 8 months of the registrant's receipt of the
Notice. Because you have failed to submit appropriate or adequate data/information within the time provided for
the data/information requirements listed in Attachment II, the Agency is issuing this Notice of Intent to Suspend.

 On October 20, 1994, EPA received an application to amend an EUP from Ciba-Geigy Corporation, Seed Division (Ciba
Seeds), P.O. Box 12257, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709&hyph;2257. The EUP application is assigned

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of November 2, 1994 (59 FR 54904), EPA announced issuance of an extension for this EUP. The approved EUP extension allows
the use of 197.1 grams of the Bacillus thuringiensis

-endotoxin (produced by a bacterially derived CryIA(b) gene in corn plants) in seeds planted on 190 acres of corn to
evaluate the control of the European corn borer and other lepidopteran pests. The program is currently authorized
only in the States of California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South
Dakota, and Wisconsin and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The experimental use permit extension is effective for
plantings from April 12, 1994 to March 31, 1995, and associated activities such as collection of field data and harvesting
and processing of seed after last planting. Corn grown under this permit is not permitted to enter commerce. Ciba Seeds
has applied to amend the EUP by diverting plantings of up to 45 acres of transgenic Bt corn from previously authorized
plantings in Hawaii and Illinois to Texas. Thus, the additional test sites will not increase the total acreage authorized
under the current EUP.

Upon review of the Ciba Seeds application, any comments received in response to this notice and any other relevant

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Proposed discharges of dredged or fill material in Great Lakes Waters must be evaluated to determine the potential
environmental impacts of such activities. Specifically, Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
of 1972, Public Law 92&hyph;500, as amended by the CWA, Public Law 95&hyph;217, requires that the discharge of dredged
or fill material into waters of the U.S. be permitted by the CE. EPA has the primary role in developing the environmental
guidelines_the Section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (Guidelines)_in conjunction with the CE, by which permit applications
must be evaluated. The Guidelines are published at 40 CFR Part 230. Fundamental to the Guidelines is the precept that
dredged or fill material should not be discharged into the aquatic ecosystem, unless it can be demonstrated that such
a discharge will not have an unacceptable adverse impact either individually or in combination with known and/or
probable impacts of other activities affecting the ecosystems of concern. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Dredged material testing is part of the larger evaluation of a proposed discharge activity to determine its compliance
with the Guidelines. Sections 230.60 and 230.61 of the Guidelines provide the basis for certain contaminant-related
factual determinations regarding the potential environmental effects of a proposed discharge. The draft Great
Lakes Manual provides regional guidance on the testing provision of the Guidelines, supplementing the draft National
Manual which was noticed for comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 21, 1994 (59 FR 37234). The manuals detail the physical, chemical, and biological evaluation procedures outlined
in &sect;&sect;230.60 and 230.61, including technical guidance on sampling and handling, quality assurance, chemical
and physical analysis, and biological effects testing. The draft Great Lakes Manual contains more specific information
for the Great Lakes system, including detailed bioassay test protocols. Conclusions reached utilizing the manuals
will be used to make factual determinations of the potential environmental effects of a proposed discharge of dredged
material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final Great Lakes Manual will be published in approximately 6 months after review and consideration of the comments
received on this draft and in coordination with the development of the final National Manual.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Public notice is hereby given in accordance with the provisions of section 1413 of the Safe Drinking Water Act as amended,
42 U.S.C. 300g&hyph;2, and 40 CFR part 142, Subpart B_Primary Enforcement Responsibility, that the State of Montana
has revised its Public Water System Supervision (PWSS) Primacy Program. Montana's PWSS program, administered by
the Drinking Water Section of the Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, has adopted regulations for total
coliforms, Phase II (7 inorganic and 26 organic chemicals), Phase IIb (1 inorganic and 4 organic chemicals), Phase
V (5 inorganic and 18 organic chemicals), and lead and copper that correspond to the National Primary Drinking Water
Regulations (NPDWR) in 49 CFR Part 141 for total coliforms (FR Vol. 54, No. 124, June 29, 1989, Pg. 27544&hyph;27568),
Phase II (FR Vol. 56, No. 20, January 30, 1991, Pg. 3526&hyph;3597), Phase IIb (FR Vol. 56, No. 126, July 1, 1991, Pg.
30266&hyph;30281), Phase V (FR Vol. 57, No. 138, July 17, 1992, Pg. 31776&hyph;31849), and for lead and copper (FR
Vol. 56, No. 110, June 7, 1991, Pg. 26460&hyph;26564). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has completed its
review of Montana's primacy revisions and has determined that they are no less stringent than the NPDWRs. EPA therefore
approves Montana's primacy revisions for Total Coliforms, Phase II, IIb, V, and Lead and Copper Rules. This determination
shall become effective January 18, 1995.

 On 11/10/94, the Commission adopted a Sixth Order on Reconsideration, Fifth Report and Order, and Seventh Notice
of Proposed Rulemaking, in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;215, Implementation of Sections of the Cable Television Consumer
Protection and Competition Act of 1992, Rate Regulation. In this Order, we added rules establishing an additional
cable programming service tier (CPST) category which we refer to a new programming tier (NPT). Section 76.987(g)
requires cable operators to file with the Commission, within 30 days of offering a NPT, a copy of the new rate card that
contains the following information on the BSTs (basic service tiers), CPSTs, and NPTs: 1) the names of the programming
services contained on each tier; and 2) the price of each tier. Operators also must file with the Commission, copies
of notifications that were sent to subscribers regarding the initial offering of NPTs. After this initial filing,
cable operators must file updated rate cards and copies of customer notifications with the Commission within 30 days
of rate or service changes affecting the NPT. The information is used by FCC staff to ensure that cable operators are
complying with our conditions for NPTs, i.e., that operators are not making fundamental changes to what they offer
on their tiers of service, and that subscribers are given due notice of NPT introductions.

 On 2/22/94, the Commission adopted a Second Order on Reconsideration, Fourth Report and Order, and Fifth Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking in MM Docket No. 92&hyph;266, Implementation of Sections of the Cable Television Consumer Protection
and Competition Act of 1992, Rate Regulation. Using a more sophisticated economic model, we have recalculated the
competitive differential to reflect a more accurate estimate of the difference between competitive and noncompetitive
cable rates. In addition, we have improved the measure of equipment and installation revenues. On 11/10/94, the Commission
adopted a Sixth Order on Reconsideration, Fifth Report and Order, and Seventh Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, referred
to as the ``Going Forward'' order. This Order further revised its rules for rate adjustments when channels are added
or deleted, or new programming service tier channels are added or deleted, or new programming service tiers are established.
To reflect the new rule sections adopted by the Commission, Section 76.922(e)(1) and (2), we are expanding the Instructions
for FCC Form 1210, to enable cable operators to implement the revised methodology reflected in these rules. It is anticipated
that these additional instructions will be used on an interim basis between January 1, 1995 and March 31, 1995, for
operators who choose to use the new methodology. A revised version of the FCC Form 1210 that is being submitted to OMB
for approval will become effective April 1, 1995.

released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify the proposed
respondents, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint
(in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of the proceeding.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by proposed respondents that
the law has been violated as alleged in the draft of complaint, or that the facts as alleged in the draft of complaint,
other than the jurisdictional facts, are true.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently

without further notice to proposed respondents, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with
the draft of complaint and its decision containing the following order to cease and desist in disposition of the proceeding
and (2) make information public in respect thereto. When so entered, the order to cease and desist shall have the same

for other orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the U.S. Postal Service of the complaint and
decision containing the agreed-to-order to proposed respondents' address as stated in this agreement shall constitute
service. Proposed respondents waive any right they may have to any other manner of service. The complaint may be used
in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation not contained
in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Proposed respondents have read the proposed complaint and order contemplated hereby. They understand that once
the order has been issued, they will be required to file one or more compliance reports showing that they have fully

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to a proposed consent order from Gateway Educational Products,
Ltd. (``Gateway''), and John Shanahan and John Herlihy, officers of Gateway.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested
persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This matter concerns the ``Hooked on Phonics'' reading program (``HOP''). The Commission's proposed complaint
alleges that the respondents represented in their advertisements and promotional materials that HOP will quickly
and easily teach persons with reading problems or disabilities to read, regardless of the nature of the problem or
disability; is effective for teaching persons with learning disabilities, including dyslexia and attention deficit
disorders, to read; will cause users with reading problems or disabilities to achieve significant improvement in
reading levels and classroom grades; is effective for teaching persons in a home setting to read, without the need
for additional assistance such as a teacher or tutor; is effective for teaching reading comprehension skills; has
helped nearly one million students to learn to read at home; and that testimonials or endorsements appearing in the
HOP advertising reflect consumers' typical or ordinary experiences using HOP. The complaint alleges that the respondents
falsely represented that they relied upon a reasonable basis for these representations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to prevent the respondents from engaging in similar acts
and practices in the future. Part I requires respondents to possess adequate substantiation for the HOP efficacy
claims alleged in the complaint, as well as for any claims that any educational program or product will be effective
for teaching reading or provides any other educational benefit. The substantiation level required is competent
and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part II of the proposed order prohibits the respondents, in advertising any educational program or product, from
representing that any endorsement represents the typical experience of consumers who use the program or product,
unless the claim is substantiated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Parts III through VII relate to the respondents' obligations to retain substantiation materials; to notify the Commission
of changes in corporate identity, or in the case of the individuals, employment; to distribute copies of the order
to certain employees; and to file compliance reports with the Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order, and it is not intended to constitute
an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent agreement, accepted subject to final Commission approval, would require, among other things, three
New York-based companies and their officer to divest six supermarkets, within 12 months, to a Commission-approved
acquirer or acquirers. If the respondents fail to satisfy the divestiture requirements, the proposed order would
permit the Commission to appoint a trustee to divest supermarkets to satisfy the terms of the order. The consent agreement
also would prohibit the respondents, for ten years, from acquiring, without prior Commission approval, any supermarket
or any interest in an entity that owns or operates a supermarket in New York County south of 116th Street. In addition,
the respondents, for ten years, would be prohibited from entering into or enforcing any agreement that restricts
the ability of any person acquiring any supermarket owned or operated by any respondent in New York County south of
116th Street.

have not opposed, in writing, including the reasons for opposing, the selection of any proposed trustee within ten
(10) days after written notice by the staff of the Commission to respondents of the identity of any proposed trustee,
respondents shall be deemed to have consented to the selection of the proposed trustee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Subject to the prior approval of the Commission, the trustee shall have the exclusive power and authority to divest
any of the supermarkets listed in Paragraph II (and all assets, leases, properties, business and goodwill, tangible
and intangible, utilized in the distribution or sale of groceries at the listed locations) that are owned or operated
by any respondent at the time of the appointment of the trustee in order to comply with Paragraph II. of this order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Within ten (10) days after appointment of the trustee, respondents shall execute a trust agreement that, subject
to the prior approval of the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, of the court, transfers to the
trustee all rights and powers necessary to permit the trustee to effect the divestitures required by Paragraph II.
of this order. Such trust agreement may include a confidentiality agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The trustee shall have twelve (12) months from the date the Commission or court approves the trust agreement described

divestiture can be achieved within a reasonable time, the divestiture period may be extended by the Commission, or,
in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court; provided, however, the Commission may extend this 12-month
period only one (1) time for one (1) year.

the supermarkets listed in Paragraph II. (and all assets, leases, properties, business and goodwill, tangible and
intangible, utilized in the distribution or sale of groceries at the listed locations) or to any other relevant information,
as the trustee may request. Respondents shall develop such financial or other information as such trustee may reasonably
request and shall cooperate with the trustee. Respondents shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's
accomplishment of the divestitures. Any delays in divestiture caused by respondents shall extend the time for divestiture
under this Paragraph in an amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission or, for a court-appointed trustee,
by the court.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract
that is submitted to the Commission, subject to respondents' absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at
no minimum price. The divestitures shall be made in the manner and to the acquirer or acquirers as set out in Paragraph
II. of this order; provided, however, if the trustee receives bona fide offers, for any particular supermarket to
be divested, from more than one acquiring entity, and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such acquiring
entity for such supermarket, the trustee shall divest to the acquiring entity or entities selected by respondents
from among those approved by the Commission.

at the cost and expense of respondents, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business
brokers, appraisers, and other representatives and assistants as are necessary to carry out the trustee's duties
and responsibilities. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the sale and all expenses incurred. After
approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account of the trustee,
including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of the respondents, and
the trustee's power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part on
a commission arrangement contingent on the trustee's divesting the assets to be divested to satisfy Paragraph II.
of this order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Respondents shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
or expenses arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties, including all reasonable
fees of counsel and other expenses incurred in connection with the preparation for, or defense or any claim, whether
or not resulting in any liability, except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses
result from misfeasance, gross negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner
as provided in Paragraph III. A. of this order.

Analysis of Proposed Consent Order To Aid Public Comment
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Trade Commission (``Commission'') has accepted for public comment from Red Apple Companies, Inc., John
A. Catsimatidis, Supermarket Acquisition Corporation and Sloan's Supermarkets, Inc. (a/k/a Designcraft Industries,
Inc.) (collectively referred to as the ``Red Apple respondents'') an agreement containing a proposed consent order.
The Commission is placing the agreement containing a proposed consent order on the public record for sixty (60) days
for receipt of comments by interested persons.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission
will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement
or make final the agreement's proposed order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission issued a complaint in this matter on May 27, 1994, stating that it has reason to believe that the Red Apple
respondents' acquisitions of Sloan's supermarkets between 1991 and 1993 in residential neighborhoods in New York
County, New York, located within the Upper East Side, the Upper West Side, Chelsea, and Greenwich Village would substantially
lessen competition in violation of section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and section 5 of the FTC Act,
as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45. The agreement containing a proposed consent order would, if issued by the Commission, settle
the charges alleged in the Commission's complaint.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order requires the Red Apple respondents to divest a combination of six supermarkets from two
lists of supermarkets organized by geographic market. The listed supermarkets are all located in the Upper East Side,
the Upper West Side, Chelsea, and Greenwich Village. Under the proposed consent order, the Red Apple respondents
must divest one supermarket within each of the four geographic markets and two additional supermarkets in those geographic
markets. The proposed consent order gives the Red Apple respondents 12 months to divest these supermarkets to an acquirer
or acquirers that receive the prior approval of the Commission. Under the proposed consent order, if the Red Apple
respondents fail to satisfy the divestiture provisions, the Commission may appoint a trustee to divest supermarkets
to satisfy the terms of the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order also prohibits the Red Apple respondents, for a ten-year period, from acquiring, without
prior approval from the Commission, any supermarket (or leasehold interest in a supermarket, or stock, share capital,
equity or other interest in an entity that owns or operates a supermarket) located in new York County south of 116th
Street. The word ``supermarket'' is defined in the order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed consent order also prohibits the Red Apple respondents, for a ten-year period, from entering into or
enforcing any agreement that restricts the ability of any person acquiring any supermarket owned or operated by any
respondent in New York County south of 116th Street to operate a supermarket or retail food store.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed consent order, the Red Apple respondents are required to provide to the Commission a report of compliance
with the order within sixty (60) days following the date the order becomes final, every sixty (60) days thereafter
until the divestitures are completed, and annually for a period of ten years.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is anticipated that the order will resolve the competitive problems alleged in the complaint. The purpose of this
analysis is to invite public comment on the proposed consent order to aid the Commission in its determination of whether
it should make final the proposed consent order contained in the agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This analysis is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed consent order,
nor is it intended to modify the terms of the agreement and proposed consent order in any way.

In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition,
this consent order requires, among other things, an Ohio-based drugstore chain to divest, within twelve months,
to a Commission approved acquirer, either the pharmacy business that it owns or the pharmacy business acquired from
Hook-SupeRx, Inc. (HSI) in each of three geographic areas in Virginia. If the divestitures are not completed within
twelve months, the order requires the respondent to consent to the appointment of a trustee to divest the assets. In
addition, the consent order requires the respondent to obtain prior Commission approval, for ten years, before acquiring
any similar business interest in any of the three specified geographic areas.

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Title VII of the ``Business Opportunity Development Act of 1988'' (Public Law 100&hyph;656) established the Small
Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program and designated nine (9) agencies, including GSA, to conduct the
program over a four (4) year period from January 1, 1989 to December 31, 1992. The Small Business Opportunity Enhancement
Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&hyph;366) extended the demonstration program until September 1996 and made certain changes
in the procedures for operation of the demonstration program. The law designated four (4) industry groups for testing
whether the competitive capability of the specified industry groups will enable them to successfully compete on
an unrestricted basis. The four (4) industry groups are: Construction (except dredging); architectural and engineering
(A&amp;E) services (including surveying and mapping); refuse systems and related services (limited to trash/garbage
collection); and non-nuclear ship repair. Under the program, when a participating agency misses its small business
participation goal, restricted competition is reinstituted only for those contracting activities that failed
to attain the goal. The small business goal is 40 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for construction, trash/garbage
collection services, and non-nuclear ship repair and 35 percent of the total contract dollars awarded for architect-engineer
services. This notice announces modifications to GSA's solicitation practices under the demonstration program
based on a review of the agency's performance during the period from October 1, 1993 to September 30, 1994. Modifications
to solicitation practices are outlined in the Supplementary Information section below and apply to solicitations
issued on or after January 1, 1995.

During the month of November 1994, the HHS Office of Inspector General imposed exclusions in the cases set forth below.
When an exclusion is imposed, no program payment is made to anyone for any items or services (other than an emergency
item or service not provided in a hospital emergency room) furnished, ordered or prescribed by an excluded party under
the Medicare, Medicaid, Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant and Block Grants to States for Social Services
programs. In addition, no program payment is made to any business or facility, e.g., a hospital, that submits bills
for payment for items or services provided by an excluded party. Program beneficiaries remain free to decide for themselves
whether they will continue to use the services of an excluded party even though no program payments will be made for
items and services provided by that excluded party. The exclusions have national effect and also apply to all other
Federal non-procurement programs.

The Use of Fraud Alerts by the OIG 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Over the years, the OIG has used fraud alerts as a vehicle to identify fraudulent and abusive practices within the health
care industry. The majority of these fraud alerts are disseminated internally to the OIG's Office of Investigations
and other agencies within the Department. However, the OIG has also developed and issued Special Fraud Alerts intended
for extensive distribution directly to the health care provider community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Special Fraud Alerts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since 1988, the OIG has issued 5 ``Special Fraud Alerts'' addressing specific trends of health care fraud and certain
practices of an industry-wide character. Specifically, the OIG Special Fraud Alerts have served to provide general
guidance to the health care industry on violations of Federal law (including various aspects of the anti-kickback
statute), as well as to provide additional insight to the Medicare carrier fraud units in identifying health care
fraud schemes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In developing these Special Fraud Alerts, the OIG relies on a number of sources, such as studies or management and program
evaluations conducted by the OIG's Office of Evaluation and Inspections. In addition, the OIG may consult with experts
in the subject field, including those within the OIG, other agencies of the Department, other Federal and State agencies,
and from those in the health care industry.

The Nature of Past Special Fraud Alerts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the most part, the OIG Special Fraud Alerts have been reserved for national trends in health care fraud and have
addressed potential violations of the Medicare and State health care programs' anti-kickback statute. The Special
Fraud Alerts have addressed the following topic areas that could violate the anti-kickback statute: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Joint venture arrangements;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Routine waiver of Medicare Part B copayments and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deductibles;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Hospital incentives to referring physicians;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Prescription drug marketing practices;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Arrangements for the provision of clinical laboratory services.

II. Federal Register Publication of Special Fraud Alerts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the past, the OIG has always printed and distributed copies of these Special Fraud Alerts directly to all Medicare
program providers. While the OIG Special Fraud Alerts have been designed to be available to all affected program providers,
we believe it is useful to publicize these various issues and concerns involving potential abusive health care industry
practices to a more widespread audience. For this reason, we are using this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice as a vehicle to reprint the substance of the 5 previously-issued Special Fraud Alerts cited above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is our intention to use this same 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 form for publishing future Special Fraud Alerts developed by the OIG. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because each of the previously-developed Special Fraud Alerts contained a similar brief narrative as to the nature
of the OIG and a description of the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, we will first summarize and set out
this material in one section, as it is germane to all 5 subject issuances. Following that will be the main body and content
of each of the Special Fraud Alerts. Lastly, we have provided the general information set forth in each of these Special
Fraud Alerts addressing information on how to report information on suspected violations.

A. General Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Inspector General was established at the Department of Health and Human Services by Congress in 1976
to identify and eliminate fraud, abuse and waste in Health and Human Services programs and to promote efficiency and
economy in departmental operations. The OIG carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations
and inspections. To help reduce fraud in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the OIG is actively investigating violations
of the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute, 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a-7b(b).

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
What Is the Medicare and Medicaid Anti-Kickback Law?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Among its provisions, the anti-kickback statute penalizes anyone who knowingly and willfully solicits, receives,
offers or pays remuneration in cash or in kind to induce, or in return for: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Referring an individual to a person for the furnishing, or arranging for the furnishing, of any item or service payable
under the Medicare or Medicaid program; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Purchasing, leasing or ordering , or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering, any goods,
facility, service or item payable under the Medicare or Medicaid program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Violators are subject to criminal penalties, or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs,
or both. In 1987, section 14 of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act, PL 100&hyph;93, directed
this Department to promulgate ``safe harbor'' regulations, in order to provide health care providers a mechanism
to assure them that they will not be prosecuted under the anti-kickback statute for engaging in particular practices.
The Department published 11 final ``safe harbor'' regulations on July 29, 1991 (42 CFR 1001.952, 56 FR 35952), and
two more on November 5, 1992 (42 CFR 1001.952, 57 FR 52723). The scope of the anti-kickback statute is not expanded by
the ``safe harbor'' regulations; these regulations give those in good faith compliance with a ``safe harbor'' the
assurance that they will not be prosecuted under the anti-kickback statute.

B. Special Fraud Alert: Joint Venture Arrangements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Issued August 1989)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Inspector General has become aware of a proliferation of arrangements between those in a position to
refer business, such as physicians, and those providing items or services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays. Some
examples of the items or services provided in these arrangements include clinical diagnostic laboratory services,
durable medical equipment (DME), and other diagnostic services. Sometimes these deals are called ``joint ventures.''
A joint venture may take a variety of forms: it may be a contractual arrangement between two or more parties to cooperate
in providing services, or it may involve the creation of a new legal entity by the parties, such as a limited partnership
or closely held corporation, to provide such services. Of course, there may be legitimate reasons to form a joint venture,
such as raising necessary investment capital. However, the Office of Inspector General believes that some of these
joint ventures may violate the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these suspect joint ventures, physicians may become investors in a newly formed joint venture entity. The investors
refer their patients to this new entity, and are paid by the entity in the form of ``profit distributions.'' These subject
joint ventures may be intended not so much to raise investment capital legitimately to start a business, but to lock
up a stream of referrals from the physician investors and to compensate them indirectly for these referrals. Because
physician investors can benefit financially from their referrals, unnecessary procedures and tests may be ordered
or performed, resulting in unnecessary program expenditures.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The questionable features of these suspect joint ventures may be reflected in three areas: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The manner in which investors are selected and retained; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The nature of the business structure of the joint venture; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The financing and profit distributions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Suspect Joint Ventures: What To Look For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To help you identify these suspect joint ventures, the following are examples of questionable features, which separately
or taken together may result in a business arrangement that violates the anti-kickback statute. Please note that
this is not intended as an exhaustive list, but rather gives examples of indicators of potentially unlawful activity.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Investor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Investors are chosen because they are in a position to make referrals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Physicians who are expected to make a large number of referrals may be offered a greater investment opportunity
in the joint venture than those anticipated to make fewer referrals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Physician investors may be actively encouraged to make referrals to the joint venture, and may be encouraged
to divest their ownership interest if they fail to sustain an ``acceptable'' level of referrals. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The joint venture tracks its sources of referrals, and distributes this information to the investors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Investors may be required to divest their ownership interest if they cease to practice in the service area,
for example, if they move, become disabled or retire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Investment interests may be nontransferable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Business Structure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The structure of some joint ventures may be suspect. For example, one of the parties may be an ongoing entity
already engaged in a particular line of business. That party may act as the reference laboratory or DME supplier for
the joint venture. In some of these cases, the joint venture can be best characterized as a ``shell.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;In the case of a shell laboratory joint venture, for example:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_It conducts very little testing on the premises, even though it is Medicare certified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The reference laboratory may do the vast bulk of the testing at its central processing laboratory, even though it
also serves as the ``manager'' of the shell laboratory. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Despite the location of the actual testing, the local ``shell'' laboratory bills Medicare directly for these tests.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;In the case of a shell DME joint venture, for example: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_It owns very little of the DME or other capital equipment; rather the ongoing entity owns them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_The ongoing entity is responsible for all day-to-day operations of the joint venture, such as delivery of the DME
and billing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Financing and Profit Distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;The amount of capital invested by the physician may be disproportionately small and the returns on investment
may be disproportionately large when compared to a typical investment in a new business enterprise. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Physician investors may invest only a nominal amount, such as $500 to $1500. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Physician investors may be permitted to ``borrow'' the amount of the ``investment'' from the entity, and pay
it back through deductions from profit distributions, thus eliminating even the need to contribute cash to the partnership.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Investors may be paid extraordinary returns on the investment in comparison with the risk involved, often
well over 50 to 100 percent per year.

C. Special Fraud Alert: Routine Waiver of Copayments or Deductibles Under Medicare Part B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Issued May 1991) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To help reduce fraud in the Medicare program, the Office of Inspector General is actively investigating health care
providers, practitioners and suppliers of health care items and services who (1) are paid on the basis of charges
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 and (2) routinely waive (do not bill) Medicare deductible and copayment charges to beneficiaries for items and services
covered by the Medicare program.

or suppliers who are paid on the basis of costs or diagnostic related groups. The fact that these types of services are
not discussed in this fraud alert should not be interpreted to legitimize routine waiver of deductibles and copayments
with respect to these payment methods. Also, it does not apply to a waiver of any copayment by a Federally qualified
health care center with respect to an individual who qualifies for subsidized services under a provision of the Public
Health Service Act.

What Are Medicare Deductible and Copayment Charges? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Medicare ``deductible'' is the amount that must be paid by a Medicare beneficiary before Medicare will pay for
any items or services for that individual. Currently, the Medicare Part B deductible is $100 per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Copayment'' (``coinsurance'') is the portion of the cost of an item or service which the Medicare beneficiary must
pay. Currently, the Medicare Part B coinsurance is generally 20 percent of the reasonable charge for the item or service.
Typically, if the Medicare reasonable charge for a Part B item or service is $100, the Medicare beneficiary (who has
met his [or her] deductible) must pay $20 of the physician's bill, and Medicare will pay $80.

Why Is it Illegal for ``Charged-Based'' Providers, Practitioners and Suppliers to Routinely Waive Medicare Copayment
and Deductibles? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Routine waiver of deductibles and copayments by charge-based providers, practitioners or suppliers is unlawful
because it results in (1) false claims, (2) violations of the anti-kickback statute, and (3) excessive utilization
of items and services paid for by Medicare. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A ``charge-based'' provider, practitioner or supplier is one who is paid by Medicare on the basis of the ``reasonable
charge'' for the item or service provided. 42 U.S.C. 1395u(b)(3); 42 CFR 405.501. Medicare typically pays 80 percent
of the reasonable charge. 42 U.S.C. 1395l(a)(1). The criteria for determining what charges are reasonable are contained
in regulations, and include an examination of (1) the actual charge for the item or service, (2) the customary charge
for the item or service, (3) the prevailing charge in the same locality for similar items or services. The Medicare
reasonable charge cannot exceed the actual charge for the item or service, and may generally not exceed the customary
charge or the highest prevailing charge for the item or service. In some cases, the provider, practitioner or supplier
will be paid the lesser of his [or her] actual charge or an amount established by a fee schedule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A provider, practitioner or supplier who routinely waives Medicare copayments or deductibles is misstating its
actual charge. For example, if a supplier claims that its charge for a piece of equipment is $100, but routinely waives
the copayment, the actual charge is $80. Medicare should be paying 80 percent of $80 (or $64), rather than 80 percent
of $100 (or $80). As a result of the supplier's misrepresentation, the Medicare program is paying $16 more than it should
for this item. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In certain cases, a provider, practitioner or supplier who routinely waives Medicare copayments or deductibles
also could be held liable under the Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback statute. 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7b(b). The
statute makes it illegal to offer, pay, solicit or receive anything of value as an inducement to generate business
payable by Medicare or Medicaid. When providers, practitioners or suppliers forgive financial obligations for
reasons other than genuine financial hardship of the particular patient, they may be unlawfully inducing that patient
to purchase items or services from them.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At first glance, it may appear that routine waiver of copayments and deductibles helps Medicare beneficiaries. By
waiving Medicare copayments and deductibles, the provider of services may claim that the beneficiary incurs no costs.
In fact, this is not true. Studies have shown that if patients are required to pay even a small portion of their care,
they will be better health care consumers, and select items or services because they are medically needed, rather
than simply because they are free. Ultimately, if Medicare pays more for an item or service than it should, or if it pays
for unnecessary items or services, there are less Medicare funds available to pay for truly needed services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One important exception to the prohibition against waiving copayments and deductibles is that providers, practitioners
or suppliers may forgive the copayment in consideration of a particular patient's financial hardship. This hardship
exception, however, must not be used routinely; it should be used occasionally to address the special financial needs
of a particular patient. Except in such special cases, a good faith effort to collect deductibles and copayments must
be made. Otherwise, claims submitted to Medicare mat violate the statutes discussed above and other provisions of
the law.

What Penalties Can Someone Be Subject to for Routinely Waiving Medicare Copayments or Deductibles? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Whoever submits a false claim to the Medicare program (for example, a claim misrepresents an actual charge) may be
subject to criminal, civil or administrative liability for making false statements and/or submitting false claims
to the Government. 18 U.S.C. 287 and 1001; 31 U.S.C. 3729; 42 CFR 1320a&hyph;7a). Penalties can include imprisonment,
criminal fines, civil damages and forfeitures, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from Medicare and the State
health care programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, anyone who routinely waives copayments or deductibles can be criminally prosecuted under 42 U.S.C.
1320a&hyph;7b(b), and excluded from participating in Medicare and the State health care programs under the anti-kickback
statute. 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7(b)(7). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, anyone who furnishes items or services to patient substantially in excess of the needs of such patients can
be excluded from Medicare and the State health care programs. 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7(b)(6)(B).

&bull;Collection of copayments and deductibles only where the beneficiary has Medicare supplemental insurance
(``Medigap'') coverage (i.e., the items or services are ``free'' to the beneficiary).

&bull;``Insurance programs'' which cover copayments or deductibles only for items or services provided by the entity
offering the insurance. The ``insurance premium'' paid by the beneficiary is insignificant and can be as low as $1

Why Do Hospitals Provide Economic Incentives to Physicians? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As many hospitals have become more aggressive in their attempts to recruit and retain physicians and increase patient
referrals, physician incentives (sometimes referred to as ``practice enhancements'') are becoming increasingly
common. Some physicians actively solicit such incentives. These incentives may result in reductions in the physician's
professional expenses or an increase in his or her revenues. In exchange, the physician is aware that he or she is often
expected to refer the majority, if not all, of his or her patients to the hospital providing the incentives. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
Why Is it Illegal for Hospitals to Provide Financial Incentives to Physicians for Their Referrals? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Inspector General has become aware of a variety of hospital incentive programs used to compensate physicians
(directly or indirectly) for referring patients to the hospital. These arrangements are implicated by the anti-kickback
statute because they can constitute remuneration offered to induce, or in return for, the referral of business paid
for by Medicare or Medicaid. In addition, they are not protected under the existing ``safe harbor'' regulations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These incentive programs can interfere with the physician's judgment of what is the most appropriate care for a patient.
They can inflate costs to the Medicare program by causing physicians to overuse inappropriately the services of a
particular hospital. The incentives may result in the delivery of inappropriate care to Medicare beneficiaries
and Medicaid recipients by inducing the physician to refer patients to the hospital providing financial incentives
rather than to another hospital (or non-acute care facility) offering the best or most appropriate care for that patient.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
How Does the Anti-Kickback Law Relate to Prescription Drug Marketing Schemes? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In recent years, prescription drug companies in the United States have increased their marketing activities among
providers, patients and suppliers such as pharmacies. Many prescription drug marketing activities go far beyond
traditional advertising and educational contacts. Physicians, suppliers and, increasingly, patients are being
offered valuable, non-medical benefits in exchange for selecting specific prescription drug brands. Traditionally,
physicians and pharmacists have been trusted to provide treatments and recommend products in the best interest of
the patient. In an era of aggressive drug marketing, however, patients may now be using prescription drug items, unaware
that their physician or pharmacist is being compensated for promoting the selection of a specific product. Prescription
drugs supplied under one of these programs are often reimbursed under Medicaid. Among the specific activities, which
the OIG has identified, are the following actual cases: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A ``product conversion'' program which resulted in 96,000 brand-name conversions. In this scenario, for
instance, Drug Company A offered a cash award to pharmacies for each time a drug prescription was changed from Drug
Company B's product to Drug Company A's product. The pharmacies were induced to help persuade physicians, who were
unaware of the pharmacies' financial interest, to change prescription. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A ``frequent flier'' campaign in which physicians were given credit toward airline frequent flier mileage
each time the physician completed a questionnaire for a new patient placed on the drug company's product. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;A ``research grant'' program in which physicians were given substantial payments for de minimis recordkeeping
tasks. The physician administered the drug manufacturer's product to the patient and made brief notes, sometimes
a single word, about the treatment outcome. Upon completion of a limited number of such ``studies,'' the physician
received payment from the manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If one purpose of any of these marketing schemes is to induce the provision of a prescription drug item reimbursable
by Medicaid, then the criminal anti-kickback statute is implicated. There is no statutory exception or ``safe harbor''
to protect such activities. Thus a physician, pharmacy or other practitioner or supplier receiving payment under
these activities may be subject to criminal prosecution and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid
programs.

A marketing program that is illegal under the anti-kickback statute may pose a danger to patients because the offering
or payment of remuneration may interfere with a physician's judgment in determining the most appropriate treatment
for a patient. Further, where the patient is a Medicaid beneficiary, these drug marketing practices may increase
the Federal government's costs of reimbursing suppliers for the products. The OIG is investigating various drug
marketing schemes, and enforcing the anti-kickback laws where these practices affect the Federal health care programs.

What To Look For
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Generally, a payment or gift may be considered improper under 42 U.S.C. 1320a&hyph;7b(b) if it is:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Made to a person in a position to generate business for the paying party;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Related to the volume of business generated; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;More than nominal in value and/or exceeds fair market value of any legitimate service rendered to the payer,
or is unrelated to any service at all other than referral of patients.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OIG investigation may be warranted where one or more of the following features is present in prescription drug marketing
activities:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Any prize, gift or cash payment, coupon or bonus (e.g., airline discounts and related travel premiums), offered
to physicians and/or suppliers (including pharmacies, mail order prescription drug companies and managed care
organizations) in exchange for, or based on, prescribing or providing specific prescription products. These items
are particularly suspect if based on value or volume of business generated for the drug company.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Materials which offer cash or other benefits to pharmacists (or others in a position to recommend prescription
drug products) in exchange for performing marketing tasks in the course of pharmacy practice related to Medicare
or Medicaid. The marketing tasks may include sales-oriented ``educational'' or ``counseling'' contacts, or physician
and/or patient outreach, etc.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Grants to physicians and clinicians for studies of prescription products when the studies are of questionable
scientific value and require little or no actual scientific pursuit. The grants may nonetheless offer substantial
benefits based on, or related to, use of the product.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Any payment, including cash or other benefit, given to a patient, provider or supplier for changing a prescription,
or recommending or requesting such a change, from one product to another, unless the payment is made fully consistent
with a ``safe harbor'' regulation, 42 CFR 1001.952, or other Federal provision governing the reporting of prescription
drug prices.

F. Special Fraud Alert: Arrangements for the Provision of Clinical Lab Services
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Issued October 1994)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 -->
How Does the Anti-Kickback Statute Relate to Arrangements for the Provision of Clinical Lab Services?
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Many physicians and other health care providers rely on the services of outside clinical laboratories to which they
may refer high volumes of patient specimens every day. The quality, timeliness and cost of these services are of obvious
concern to Medicare and Medicaid patients and to the programs that finance their health care services. Since the physician,
not the patient, generally selects the clinical laboratory, it is essential that the physician's decision regarding
where to refer specimens is based only on the best interests of the patient.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Whenever a laboratory offers or gives to a source of referrals anything of value not paid for at fair market value, the
inference may be made that the thing of value is offered to induce the referral of business. The same is true whenever
a referral source solicits or receives anything of value from the laboratory. By ``fair market value'' we mean value
for general commercial purposes. However, ``fair market value'' must reflect an arms length transaction which has
not been adjusted to include the additional value which one or both of the parties has attributed to the referral of
business between them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The office of Inspector General has become aware of a number of practices engaged in by clinical laboratories and health
care providers that implicate the anti-kickback statute in this manner. Below are some examples of lab services arrangements
that may violate the anti-kickback statute.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Provision of Phlebotomy Services to Physicians
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When permitted by State law, a laboratory may make available to a physician's office a phlebotomist who collects specimens
from patients for testing by the outside laboratory. While the mere placement of a laboratory employee in the physician's
office would not necessarily serve as an inducement prohibited by the anti-kickback statute, the statute is implicated
when the phlebotomist performs additional tasks that are normally the responsibility of the physician's office
staff. These tasks can include taking vital signs or other nursing functions, testing for the physician's office
laboratory, or performing clerical services.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where the phlebotomist performs clerical or medical functions not directly related to the collection or processing
of laboratory specimens, a strong inference arises that he or she is providing a benefit in return for the physician's
referrals to the laboratory. In such a case, the physician, the phlebotomist, and the laboratory may have exposure
under the anti-kickback statute. This analysis applies equally to the placement of phlebotomists in other health
care settings, including nursing homes, clinics and hospitals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the mere existence of a contract between the laboratory and the health care provider that prohibits
the phlebotomist from performing services unrelated to specimen collection does not eliminate the OIG's concern,
where the phlebotomist is not closely monitored by his [of her] employer or where the contractual prohibition is not
rigorously enforced.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Lab Pricing at Renal Dialysis Centers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Medicare program pays for laboratory tests provided to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) in two different
ways. Some laboratory testing is considered routine and payment is included in the composite rate paid by Medicare
to the ESRD facility which in turn pays the laboratory. Some laboratory testing required by the patient is not included
in the composite rate, and these additional tests are billed by the laboratory directly to Medicare and paid at the
usual laboratory fee schedule price.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OIG is aware of cases where a laboratory offers to perform the tests encompassed by the composite rate at a price
below fair market value of the tests performed. In order to offset the low charges on the composite rate tests, the ESRD
facility agrees to refer all or most of its non-composite rate tests to the laboratory. This arrangement appears to
be an offer of something of value (composite rate tests below fair market value) in return for the ordering of additional
tests which are billed directly to the Medicare program.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If offered or accepted in return for referral of additional business, the lab's pricing scheme is illegal remuneration
under the anti-kickback statute. The statutory exception and ``safe harbor'' for ``discounts'' does not apply to
immunize parties to this type of transaction, since discounts on the composite rate tests are offered to induce referral
of 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
other 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tests. See 42 CFR 1001.952(h)(3)(ii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Waiver of Charges To Managed Care Patients
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Managed care plans may require a physician or other health care provider to use only the laboratory with which the plan
has negotiated a fee schedule. In such situations, the plan usually will refuse to pay claims submitted by other laboratories.
The provider, however, may use a different laboratory and may wish to continue to use that laboratory for non-managed
care patients. In order to retain the provider as a client, the laboratory that does not have the managed care contract
may agree to perform the managed care work free of charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The status of such agreements under the anti-kickback statute depends in part on the nature of the contractual relationship
between the managed care plan and its providers. Under the terms of many managed care contracts, a provider receives
a bonus or other payment if utilization of ancillary services, such as laboratory testing, is kept below a particular
level. Other managed care plans impose financial penalties if the provider's utilization of services exceeds pre-established
levels. When the laboratory agrees to write off charges for the physician's managed care work, the physician may realize
a financial benefit from the managed care plan created by the appearance that utilization of tests has been reduced.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In cases where the provision of free services results in a benefit to the provider, the anti-kickback statute is implicated.
If offered or accepted in return for the referral of Medicare or State health care plan business, both the laboratory
and the physician may be violating the anti-kickback statute. There is no statutory exception or ``safe harbor''
to immunize any party to such a practice because the Federal programs do not realize the benefit of these ``free'' services.
See 42 CFR 1001.952(h)(3)(iii).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Other Inducements
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following are additional examples of inducements offered by clinical laboratories which may implicate the anti-kickback
statute:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Free pick-up and disposal of bio-hazardous waste products (such as sharps) unrelated to the collection of
specimens for the outside laboratory.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Provision of computers or fax machines, unless such equipment is integral to, and exclusively used for, performance
of the outside laboratory's work.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Provision of free laboratory testing for health care providers, their families and their employees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The November 22, 1994 (59 FR 60158) notice of availability and request for comment provided a 30 day period during which
the Department would receive comments regarding its proposed Section 4(e) conditions for the Kerr Hydroelectric
Project. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. 797(e), the proposed conditions provide for the adequate protection
and utilization of the Flathead Indian Reservation and the Fish and Wildlife Service administered Flathead Waterfowl
Production Area. The proposed conditions for the Flathead Indian Reservation provide for the imposition of a base
load operational scenario at the Kerr Project. This operational scenario precludes the use of Kerr Dam as a load regulating
or peak power generation facility, and requires minimum flows, certain restrictions on flow fluctuations (ramping
rates), and a two year ramping rate study. In addition, the proposed conditions provide for non-operational measures
designed to protect and provide for adequate utilization of the Flathead Indian Reservation in conjunction with
operational measures. The non-operational measures include the development of a Fish and Wildlife Implementation
Strategy, development of an operational rule curve, habitat acquisition, habitat development, fishery supplementation
and reintroduction, development of recreational resources, and the identification and protection of cultural
resources on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The proposed conditions for the Flathead WPA provide for the imposition
of erosion control on the north shore of Flathead Lake and the upper Flathead River, island restoration, and habitat
acquisition and development. The costs of all measures will be borne by the project licensees.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The deadline for comment on the proposed Section 4(e) conditions is extended for 45 days by this notice. The comment
period, which began on November 22, 1994, therefore, consists of a total of 75 days. All comments are due to the Department
on or before February 6, 1995. In addition, the Department will be making available two technical reports that further
support the proposed Section 4(e) conditions, the ``Kerr Hydro-electric Project Report'' by Stetson Engineers,
Inc., and ``An Evaluation of the Wildlife Components of the Kerr Dam Project Mitigation and Management Plan and Recommended
Section 4(e) Articles'' by BioSystems Analysis, Inc. The proposed conditions and the above referenced reports are
available for review and copying at the Department of the Interior, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC in room 6443.
Copies of the proposed Section 4(e) conditions and the above referenced reports will be made available to all interested
parties upon request.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Current Federal policy encourages non-Federal development of electrical power resource potential on Federal water
resource projects. The Department of the Interior (Interior), in consultation with the Department of Energy, Western
Area Power Administration (Western), will consider proposals for non-Federal development of hydroelectric power
in the Diamond Fork area of the CUP and the SVP, Utah, consisting of the area from the outlet of the Syar Tunnel to the confluence
of Diamond Fork Creek and the Spanish Fork River. Interior is considering such hydroelectric power development under
a lease of power privilege. No Federal funds will be available for such hydroelectric power development. Western
would have the first opportunity to purchase and/or market the power that would be generated by such development under
a lease of power privilege. The CUP and the SVP are Federal Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) projects. This notice
presents background information, proposal content guidelines, information concerning selection of a non-Federal
entity(s) to develop hydroelectric power in the Diamond Fork area of the CUP and the SVP, and power purchasing and/or
marketing considerations. Interested parties are invited to submit proposals.

Background Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The CUP, Bonneville Unit, located in northern Utah, was authorized for construction, including hydroelectric power,
by the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) Act of April 11, 1956, (70 Stat. 105) (CRSP Act) as a participating project,
and the Central Utah Project Completion Act (Titles II through VI of Public Law 102&hyph;575, 106 Stat. 4605) (CUPCA).
The United States has constructed a portion of the Bonneville Unit of the CUP (initial phase), including, among other
features, Upper Stillwater Dam, Bottle Hollow Dam, Starvation Dam, Currant Creek Dam, Jordanelle Dam, Soldier Creek
Dam for the enlarged Strawberry Reservoir, the Syar Tunnel, and the Sixth Water Aqueduct and Tunnel. The Central Utah
Water Conservancy District (District) is constructing other features of the Bonneville Unit pursuant to CUPCA.
Section 208 of the CUPCA provides that power generation facilities associated with the CUP be developed and operated
in accordance with the CRSP Act, which explicitly embodies all Reclamation law except as otherwise provided in the
CRSP Act. The District, under its contracts with the United States, has certain operation, maintenance, replacement,
and repayment responsibilities and obligations concerning the Bonneville Unit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The United States constructed the SVP, comprising the Strawberry Dam and Reservoir, the Strawberry Tunnel, the Upper
Spanish Fork Powerplant and transmission lines, the High Line Canal, the Mapleton and Springville Lateral and related
collection, diversion, conveyance, and distribution works, all of which were substantially completed in approximately
the year 1915. The Strawberry Water Users Association (Association), under its contracts with the United States,
has the right to lease power privileges (subject to approval by Interior) and has operation, maintenance, replacement,
and repayment responsibilities and obligations concerning the SVP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interior, in consultation with Western, is considering only a consolidated system for hydroelectric power development
in the Diamond Fork area (Project), involving both the CUP and the SVP, through a lease of power privilege. The general
authority for lease of power privilege under Reclamation law includes the Town Sites and Power Development Act of
1906 (43 U.S.C. &sect;522) and the Reclamation Project Act of 1939 (43 U.S.C. &sect;485h(c)) (1939 Act).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A lease of power privilege is an alternative to Federal hydroelectric power development. The lease of power privilege
would grant to a non-Federal entity(s) the right to utilize, consistent with CUP and SVP purposes, water power head
or storage at and/or operationally in conjunction with the CUP and the SVP, for non-Federal electric power generation
and sale by the lessee(s). Any lease of power privilege in the Diamond Fork area of the CUP and SVP must accommodate pre-existing
legal rights of the District and the Association.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interior would be the lead Federal agency for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for any
lease of power privilege to develop the Project. Issuance of a lease(s) of power privilege for hydroelectric power
development in the Diamond Fork area will require compliance with Federal fish, wildlife, recreation, and environmental
laws, as determined by Interior.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western would have the first opportunity to purchase and/or market the power that would be generated by the Project
under a lease(s) of power privilege. Under this process, Western would either purchase and market the power as Salt
Lake City Area_Integrated Projects (SLCA&hyph;IP) power or market the power independently by first offering it
to preference entities and secondly to non-preference entities.

Proposal Content Guidelines
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested parties should submit proposals explaining in as precise detail as is practicable how the Project would
be developed. Factors which a proposal(s) should consider and address include, but are not limited to, the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. Provide qualifications of the proposing entity(s). Include information on preference status, type of organization,
length of time in business, experience in funding and design and construction of similar projects, industry rating(s)
that indicate financial soundness of the potential lessee(s), experience of key management personnel, history
of any reorganizations or mergers with other companies, and any other information that demonstrates the adequacy
of the proposal and financial ability to fund all studies, designs, and construction. The term ``preference,'' as
applied to a lease of power privilege, means an entity qualifying for preference to develop non-Federal hydroelectric
power, under Section 9(c) of the 1939 Act, as a municipality, public corporation or agency, or cooperative or other
nonprofit organization financed in whole or in part by loans made pursuant to the Rural Electrification Act of 1936.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Provide geographical locations and describe principal structures and other important features of the Project
including roads and transmission lines. Estimate and describe installed capacity and the capacity of the power facilities
under dry, average, and wet hydrological conditions. Also describe seasonal or annual generation patterns. Include
estimates of the amount of electrical energy that would be produced from each facility for each month of average, dry,
and wet water years. If capacity and energy can be delivered to another location, either by the proposing entity or
by potential wheeling agents, specify where capacity and energy can be delivered. Include concepts for power sales
and contractual arrangements, involved parties and the proposed approach to wheeling if required.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
C. Indicate title arrangements and the ability for acquiring title to or the right to occupy and use lands necessary
for the Project, including such additional lands as may be required during construction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
D. Identify water rights applicable to the proper operation of the Project, the holder of such rights, and how these
rights would be acquired or perfected.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
E. Explain studies necessary to adequately define impacts on the CUP and the SVP and the environment in order to facilitate
the decision making process. Explain any proposed use of the Project for conservation and utilization of the available
water resources in the public interest. Describe any significant environmental issues and the approach for gathering
data and handling the environmental issues to protect and enhance the quality of the environment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
F. Describe anticipated contractual arrangements with the District and the Association and define how the Project
would operate in harmony with the CUP and the SVP.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. Provide a management plan to accomplish such activities as planning, NEPA compliance, design, construction,
operation, and maintenance. Prepare schedules of these activities as is applicable. Describe what studies are necessary
to accomplish the hydroelectric power development and how the studies would be implemented.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
H. Estimate Project development cost. This cost should include all investment costs such as the cost of studies to
determine feasibility, NEPA compliance, design, construction, and financing as well as the amortized annual cost
of the investment; also, the annual operation, maintenance, and replacement expense for the Project and other expenses
associated with the CUP and the SVP. If there are additional transmission or wheeling expenses associated with the
development of the Project, these should be included. Identify proposed methods of financing the Project. An economic
analysis should be presented that compares the present worth of all benefits and costs of the Project. Additionally,
a financial analysis should be presented that compares monies available to the United States for use of Federal facilities
and costs to the CUP and the SVP.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interior, in consultation with Western, will evaluate proposals received in response to this published notice.
A proposal will be ruled unacceptable if it is not complete, is not consistent with both CUP and SVP purposes, and does
not accommodate pre-existing legal rights of the District and the Association, as determined by Interior.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Selection of a lessee will be based on the following considerations:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. First consideration will be given to preference entities. Interior will give added consideration to proposals
that (1) are especially well-adapted to developing, conserving, and utilizing the water and natural resources;
(2) are harmonious with CUP and SVP purposes; and (3) would provide significant economic benefits to the CUP, the SVP,
and the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Second consideration will be given to non-preference entities. Interior will give added consideration to proposals
that (1) are especially well-adapted to developing, conserving, and utilizing the water and natural resources;
(2) are harmonious with CUP and SVP purposes; and (3) would provide significant economic benefits to the CUP, the SVP,

Power Purchasing and/or Marketing Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Western would have the first opportunity to purchase and/or market the power that would be generated by the Project
under a lease(s) of power privilege. Western will consult with Interior on such power purchasing and/or marketing
considerations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Western would determine its interest in purchasing the electric power from the lessee(s) as a replacement resource
for its Salt Lake City Area Integrated Projects (SLCA/IP) under principles and processes being considered as part
of Western's Replacement Power Process under the Grand Canyon Protection Act. Western would also apply Integrated
Resource Planning principles in comparing this resource with all other potential resource purchases available
to Western. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, Western may market the power available from the Project on a stand-alone basis, first to preference
entities qualified under criteria established by Western and second to non-preference entities, by developing
an individual marketing plan for this power. This marketing plan would be developed through a separate subsequent
public process beginning with a notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of Western's intent to market the power. The marketing plan would include all aspects of marketing the power, including
assignment of power to qualified preference and/or non-preference entities, pricing, transmission, and delivery
of power. Western would recover the costs it would incur in purchasing and/or marketing the power through the rates
charged for the power. Firm power rates would be established through a public process, initiated by a notice in the

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

After Interior selects a lessee, Interior will notify, in writing, all entities submitting proposals of Interior's
decision regarding selection of the potential lessee(s). The selected potential lessee(s) will have five years
from the date of such notification to enter into a lease(s) of power privilege for the site or sites identified in the
proposal. Lease of power privilege negotiation sessions will be public. If Western elects to purchase and/or market
the power, such lease(s) of power privilege will state how Western will be involved in purchasing and/or marketing

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
BLM, in cooperation with the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua &amp; Siuslaw, et al. is considering the construction
of an interpretive center to be located near the Cape Arago Lighthouse on Gregory Point in Coos County, OR (T. 26 S.,
R. 14 W., Sec. 4, Willamette Meridian). The center will be known as the Bal'diyaka Interpretive Center and could feature
the Native American history of the local tribes, as well as the historic use of this site by the U.S. Lifesaving Service
and the U.S. Coast Guard. The proposed action may consist of one or more new buildings to house the interpretive displays,
meeting rooms, offices, a new lighthouse, and related infrastructure needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Potential issues include, but may not be limited to, vehicular access and parking; social and economic values; recreation;
impacts on cultural resources, traditional Native American resources, geology and mineral resources, visual resources,
soil, watershed, and vegetation resources.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The project area will encompass approximately 40 acres, while the area of consideration of impacts will be much larger
and include the communities of Coos Bay, Charleston, North Bend, as well as associated rural areas.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consideration will be given to adjacent Federal and State administered lands as well as County and private lands and
the affect on local land use planning.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific location, design and arrangement is yet to be determined. Alternatives to be considered, other than
the No Action Alternative, are unknown at this time.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bureau of Land Management's scoping process for the EIS will include: (1) Identification of issues to be addressed;
(2) Identification of viable alternatives; and (3) Notifying interested groups, individuals, and agencies so that
additional information concerning these can be obtained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The scoping process will consist of this Federal Register Notice; a legal notice in local newspapers announcing the
scoping meetings; letters of invitation to participate in the scoping process; and a scoping meeting agenda which
further clarifies the proposed action, range of alternatives and previously identified significant issues being
considered, to be distributed to selected parties and available upon request.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the provisions of P.L. 97&hyph;451, a petition for reinstatement of oil and gas lease NDM 62731, Stark County,
North Dakota, was timely filed and accompanied by the required rental accruing from the date of termination.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No valid lease has been issued affecting the lands. The lessee has agreed to new lease terms for rentals and royalties
at rates of $5 per acre and 162/3 percent respectively. Payment of a $500 administration fee has been made.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Having met all the requirements for reinstatement of the lease as contained in Sec. 31 (d) and (e) of the Mineral Lands
Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. 188), the Bureau of Land Management is proposing to reinstate the lease, effective as
of the date of termination, subject to the original terms and conditions of the lease, the increased rental and royalty
rates cited above, and reimbursement for cost of publication of this Notice.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The purpose of the seasonal closure is to significantly reduce human-induced stress on wintering deer and elk in an
area where costs in energy loss are particularly high due to the topography and the concentration of animals. The closure
affects about 1.5 miles of road in lower Garvey Canyon. A sign will be posted before the gate indicating the closure
season and the reason. Information including maps of the restricted area is available in the Resource Area Office
and District Office at the addresses shown below. Persons who are exempt from the restrictions include:

SUMMARY: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice makes available to the public a summary of the Record of Decision (ROD) for the final Master Plan/FEIS for
the Bayou Sauvage National Wildlife Refuge, located in Orleans Parish, Louisiana. Establishment of a 19,000-acre
refuge was authorized by Congress on July 28, 1986. As of 1993, the refuge contained approximately 22,800 acres under
the supervision of the Fish and Wildlife Service (Service). There is a potential for future expansion of the refuge
to include a total of approximately 30,000 acres. Federal funding for design, construction, and operation of the
refuge is provided through appropriations by Congress. Pursuant to the Council on Environmental Quality regulations
implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (40 CFR 1505.2), the Service issues this ROD upon consideration
of the FEIS prepared for the Proposed Action.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three other alternatives evaluated in detail included:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) No Build Alternative
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Minimal Diverse Habitat Enhancement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Comprehensive Estuarine Habitat Enhancement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These alternatives were developed by the Service with input obtained from the public and review agencies during the
review and comment process. Issues raised in comments included, but are not limited to: Expansion of the refuge, hunting,
trapping, commercial fishing, public access, locations of visitor center, habitat management objectives, mosquito
control, and monitoring of management programs to achieve program objectives. All substantive issues raised during
the public and agency review process have been addressed to the satisfaction of the Service either through revisions
incorporated into the FEIS text or in responses contained in Section 9.0 of the FEIS. These responses are incorporated
by reference into the ROD. One comment was received on the FEIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Findings and Decision: Based upon a thorough analysis and consideration of the impacts identified in the FEIS, results
of the research and investigations conducted in conjunction with the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS)
and FEIS, comments received in connection with the public information hearings and review of the DEIS, public review
of management programs already approved for the refuge, and other relevant factors, including the purposes for which
the refuge was established by Congress and statutory and regulatory guidance for funding such projects, the Service
finds as follows:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The preferred alternative is Alternative 2. Alternative 2 consists of the Management and Facilities Programs
discussed previously.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Preferred Alternative best fulfills the Public Use Goal for environmental education, wildlife and habitat
interpretation, wildlife/wildlands-oriented recreation, and scientific research.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Consistent with economic, social, and other essential considerations, to the maximum extent practicable, potential
adverse environmental effects identified in the FEIS will be minimized or avoided by incorporating mitigative measures
as conditions of Federal funding approval and permit issuance. The potential impacts and mitigative measures are
described in Section 4.0 and 5.0 of the FEIS.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Only 45 acres of jurisdictional wetlands, out of the presently supervised area of approximately 22,800 acres,
are estimated to be impacted by construction of facilities on the refuge. Specific details regarding mitigation
plans for site-specific projects will be developed on a case-by-case basis as part of the Section 404 permit process.
However, under the Preferred Alternative, habitat management measures implemented on other areas of the refuge
for the purpose of increasing the quality and quantity of emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation and scrub/shrub
vegetation are expected to be more than adequate to serve as mitigation for wetlands impacted by facility construction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The Preferred Alternative is designed to conserve and/or enhance existing habitat for the presently listed threatened
and endangered species using the refuge. No State or federally listed endangered or threatened species or their critical
habitats are known to be adversely affected by implementation of the Preferred Alternative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) No historic properties listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places are know to
be adversely affected by implementation of the Preferred Alternative. Detailed cultural resources investigations
will be conducted for site-specific projects on a case-by-case basis as part of the Section 404 permit process.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Statutory authority for the Service to fund and implement, and for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to permit, the
Preferred Alternative exists.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) The requirements of NEPA and the implementing regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508) have been satisfied.

Americo Financial, Limited (Applicant) has applied to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental
take permit pursuant to Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act). The Applicant has been assigned
Permit Number PRT&hyph;782832. The requested permit, which is for a period not to exceed 10 years, would authorize
the incidental take of the endangered golden-cheeked warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia). The proposed take would
occur as a result of the construction and operation of a residential development on 294.15 acres, in two parcels, in
Austin, Travis County, Texas.

Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``taking'' of endangered species such as the golden-cheeked warbler. However,
the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species incidental to,
and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are at
50 CFR 17.22.

The Applicant plans to build a residential subdivision in northwest Austin, Travis County, Texas. An EA/HCP has been
developed as mitigation of the incidental taking of the golden-cheeked warbler. The Applicant proposes to mitigate
the incidental take via dedicating approximately 440 acres of occupied golden-cheeked warbler habitat as a permanent
preserve, providing funding for the operation and management of the preserve lands, performing golden-cheeked
warbler studies on the project lands, and avoiding construction activities within warbler territories during the
breeding season. Details of the mitigation are provided in the EA/HCP for the Great Hills Reserve.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Applicant considered five alternatives but rejected four because they were not economically viable.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 For Fiscal Year 1995, $7,486,000 is available for the funding of Rehabilitation and Innovation projects under the
Urban Park and Recreation Recovery Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95&hyph;625). NPS will consider proposals for funding projects
with a dollar limit of $200,000 (Federal share of total project cost) under the Rehabilitation phase of the program
and projects with a dollar limit of $50,000 (Federal share) under the Innovation phase. No more than ten percent ($748,600)
of the total amount appropriated will go toward the funding of Innovation proposals. Preapplications must be received
by the appropriate NPS Regional Office by no later than April 17, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Rehabilitation grants will be targeted to rehabilitate existing neighborhood recreation areas and facilities
which have deteriorated to the point where health and safety are endangered or the community's range of quality recreation
service is impaired. Proposals must be designed to provide recreation services for residents within a specified
area identified by the applicant. Proposals may identify improvements at multiple sites or facilities, each of which
must be individually addressed. Grants may be used to remodel, rebuild, expand, or develop existing outdoor or indoor
recreation areas and facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Innovation grants may generally cover the costs of personnel, training, facilities, recreation equipment, supplies
or services associated with the development of cost-effective ideas, concepts, and approaches towards improving
facility design, operations, or programming for the delivery of recreation services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Innovation projects should contribute to a systems approach to recreation by linking recreation services with other
critical community programs such as housing, transportation, health and public safety, water quality, energy conservation,
crime prevention, etc. The project should demonstrate a concept that is untried, unique, and/or advances the state
of the art for recreation at the national, regional or local level. Interested jurisdictions are directed to 36 CFR
72.45 for more detailed discussion of fundable elements under the Innovation phase of the UPARR program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to widespread interest in programs that help prevent urban crime, 1995 grant awards will focus on, but
not be limited to, youth-at-risk approaches_for example, innovation programs that combine recreation with education,
counselling or mentoring activities aimed at teens and/or rehabilitation proposals that target facilities that
will supply key recreation opportunities for the target youth populations. Program participants may be aware that
a new category of UPARR grants, called ``At-Risk-Youth'' grants, was established as part of the 1994 Omnibus Crime
Bill. However, funding is not authorized for such grants before 1996. Consequently, the 1995 grant round will highlight
crime prevention in recreation programs, without being limited exclusively to such grants. Preparations are now
underway for administration of the new UPARR grants authorized in the Crime Bill should funding for these become available
in 1996 or subsequent years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 Urban jurisdictions as listed in 36 CFR part 72 appendix B will be eligible. Additional jurisdictions meeting the
criteria for eligibility described in 36 CFR part 72 appendix A, and having been approved as discretionary applicants
by NPS, may also compete. All applicants must have a Recovery Action Program (RAP) which has been approved by NPS within
the past five years, and all projects must be in accord with the priorities outlined in the approved RAPs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Preapplication Requirements:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Local chief elected officials (mayors, etc.) applying for UPARR grants will be required to certify, in the preapplication,
that the grantee will comply with all requirements of the UPARR program. Applicants must also identify the type of
control they have over properties to be assisted. Additional requirements are outlined in the UPARR PREAPPLICATION
HANDBOOK (updated for 1995) available from the Regional Offices of NPS.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Matching Requirements: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
UPARR Rehabilitation and Innovation grants are awarded on a 70/30 (Federal/local) matching basis. As an incentive
for state involvement in the program, the Federal Government will match, dollar for dollar, state contributions
to the local share of the total project cost, up to 15 percent of the approved grant. The Federal share is limited to no
more than 85 percent of the approved grant cost and the overall dollar limitations established above for Rehabilitation
and Innovation grants, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Pass-Through Funding: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
At the discretion of the applicant jurisdiction, grants may be transferred, in whole or in part, to independent general
or special purpose local governments, private nonprofit agencies or community groups, and county or regional park
authorities that provide recreation opportunities to the general population within the jurisdictional boundaries
of the applicant jurisdiction. In such situations, the applicant jurisdiction will bear full legal responsibility
and liability for passed-through funds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Post-Completion Requirements: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Section 1010 of the UPARR Act of 1978, assisted properties may not be converted to other than public
recreation use without the prior approval of NPS and the replacement of the converted site or facility with one of reasonably
equivalent usefulness and location. This provision may not be applicable to funded Innovation projects depending
upon the nature of the assistance provided.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with Departmental policy, 28 C.F.R. 50.7 and pursuant to Section 122 of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9622, notice is hereby given that a proposed Consent
Decree in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

United States
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reeves Southeastern Corporation,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Civil Action No. 94&hyph;1752&hyph;CIV&hyph;T&hyph;24A, was lodged on November 2, 1994, with the United States
District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This case concerns the Reeves Southeastern Galvanizing (``SEG'') facility and the Reeves Southeastern Wire (``SEW'')
facility which are located along the north and south sides of State Road 574 in Tampa, and, together are known as the
Reeves Southeastern Corporation Superfund Site (the ``Site''). Pursuant to Sections 106 and 107 of the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607, the Complaint in
this action seeks recovery of all past and future costs incurred and to be incurred by the United States at the Site,
and injunctive relief for the Site, namely, implementation of remedies selected by EPA in Records of Decision (``ROD'')
for Operable Unit (``OU'') One, dated October 13, 1992, for OU two, dated September 9, 1993, and for OU three dated June
28, 1994. The ROD for OU One provides for excavation of contaminated soils and sediments at the SEW and SEG facilities,
backfilling of those excavated areas with clean fill, solidification and stabilization of contaminated soils and
sediments, disposal of the solidified material above the water table on the SEG facility and installation of a low
permeability cap over the solidified material. The ROD for OU Two requires that the surficial aquifer be monitored
for at least 21/2 years after the source control measures required in the Operable Unit One ROD have been completed.
If, after 21/2 years have expired, levels of contaminants of concern in the surficial aquifer have not been reduced
to a pre-determined targeted level, the surficial aquifer will have to be actively remediated through a pump and treat
system. If levels have attenuated to the target level, pump and treat will not be required at that time; however, monitoring
will continue. The ROD for OU Three requires sampling and monitoring of the North Wetland.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Defendant Reeves (the ``Settling Defendant'') has agreed in the proposed Consent Decree to pay the United States
$297,759 for past response costs incurred at the Site, as well as all future costs of overseeing the implementation
of the Remedial Actions of OU One, Two and Three. The Settling Defendant has also agreed to implement the remedy selected
by EPA for the Site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments
relating to the proposed Consent Decree. Comments should be addressed to the Assistant Attorney General for the Environment

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that a health care facility seeking to use nonimmigrant aliens as registered
nurses first attest to the Department of Labor (DOL) that it is taking significant steps to develop, recruit and retain
United States (U.S.) workers in the nursing profession. The law also requires that these foreign nurses will not adversely
affect U.S. nurses and that the foreign nurses will be treated fairly. The facility's attestation must be on file with
DOL before the Immigration and Naturalization Service will consider the facility's H&hyph;1A visa petitions for
bringing nonimmigrant registered nurses to the United States. 26 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) and 1181(m). The
regulations implementing the nursing attestation program are at 20 CFR Parts 655, Subpart D, and 29 CFR Part 504, (January
6, 1994). The Employment and Training Administration, pursuant to 20 CFR 655.310(c), is publishing the following
list of facilities which have submitted attestations which have been accepted for filing and those which have been
rejected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The list of facilities is published so that U.S. registered nurses, and other persons and organizations can be aware
of health care facilities that have requested foreign nurses for their staff. If U.S. registered nurses or other persons
wish to examine the attestation (on Form ETA 9029) and the supporting documentation, the facility is required to make
the attestation and documentation available. Telephone numbers of the facilities chief executive officer also
are listed to aid public inquiries. In addition, attestations and explanatory statements (but not the full supporting
documentation) are available for inspection at the address for the Employment and Training Administration set forth

1. The Employer is a diversified manufacturer of aluminum composite panels, rigid foam P.V.C. panels and polystyrene
foamcore boards. The Employer has offices and/or production sites in St. Louis, Missouri; Benton, Kentucky and Richmond,
Indiana. The Plan is a profit sharing plan which includes a cash or deferred arrangement under section 401(k) of the
Code. As of December 31, 1993, the Plan had 93 participants and total assets of approximately $1,098,635. Participants
are currently entitled to direct the investment of their account balances among seven investment funds which are
managed by Scudder Investor Services, Inc. On February 12, 1988, prior to the implementation of participant direction,
The Boatmen's National Bank of St. Louis (the Bank),
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 as trustee for the Plan, made the decision to invest a portion of the Plan's assets in a collective investment fund maintained
by the Bank and invested primarily in guaranteed investment contracts. The GIC is held as the sole asset of sub-fund
G&hyph;11 of the the collective investment fund. The GIC provided a rate of return of 8.65% per annum and a maturity
date of March 1, 1993.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
2. On April 11, 1991, Executive Life was placed into conservatorship by the Insurance Commissioner of the State of
California. The Employer represents that, pursuant to the conservatorship, payouts under the terms of Executive
Life's GICs were suspended.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 In February, 1994, Boatmen's, in its capacity as Plan trustee, elected to participate in the rehabilitation plan
for Executive Life. Although, through the rehabilitation process, the Plan has received $147,386.00 from Executive
Life, the amount of any additional payments to be received over the next several years is undetermined. Consequently,
Boatmen's has frozen that portion of participants' accounts which is attributable to the GIC. This freeze has prevented
Plan participants from exercising the rights they would normally have under the Plan to request distributions and
investment transfers with respect to amounts currently invested in the GIC.
<FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>
 The Employer represents that the Loan would preserve the Plan's rights with respect to the GIC, give participants
and beneficiaries the ability to exercise their right to request investment transfers, and provide immediate liquidity
which would facilitate benefit distributions. The proposed Loan will be made in one lump-sum payment in the amount
of the maturity value
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 of the GIC, plus post-maturity interest through the date of the Loan, credited at the rate paid on the Collective Employee
Benefit Trust Fund ``S'';
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
, less any amounts previously received pursuant to the rehabilitation process and the total amount of periodic advances
already made to the Plan. The Employer represents that the Loan is non-interest bearing and the Plan will not incur
any expenses in connection with the transaction.

The Department notes that the decisions to acquire and hold the GIC are governed by the fiduciary responsibility requirements
of Part 4, Subtitle B, Title I of the Act. In this regard, the Department is not herein proposing relief for any violations
of Part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the acquisition and holding of the GIC issued by Executive Life.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Following the cessation of payments by Executive Life with respect to the GIC, the Employer made the decision to make
periodic advances to the Plan to permit the Plan to make distributions to participants and beneficiaries entitled
to distributions as a consequence of termination of employment. The applicant represents that, as of November, 1994,
the periodic advances to the Plan totaled approximately $50,618.00. The applicant also represents that the terms
of those periodic advances satisfy the conditions of PTE 80&hyph;26 (45 FR 28545, April 29, 1980). This conditional
class exemption permits a party in interest to make an interest-free loan to an employee benefit plan, and the repayment
of such loan. Specifically, the exemption states, in relevant part, that effective January 1, 1975, the restrictions
of section 406(a)(1)(B) and (D) and section 406(b)(2) of the Act and the taxes imposed by section 4975(a) and (b) of
the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1)(B) and (D) of the Code, shall not apply to the lending of money from a party in
interest to an employee benefit plan, nor to the repayment of such loan in accordance with its terms, if no interest
or other fee is charged to the plan, the loan is unsecured, and the loan proceeds are used only for the payment of ordinary
operating expenses of the plan, including the payment of benefits in accordance with the terms of the plan.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proposed exemption the Department expresses no opinion as to whether the periodic advances satisfy the provisions
of PTE 80&hyph;26.

The maturity value is defined as the total amount deposited under the GIC, plus interest at the guaranteed interest
rate, through the date of maturity. The applicant represents that the maturity value is $297,210.76.

The Employer represents that the annualized rate of return on the Collective Employee Benefit Trust Fund ``S'' for
the period from October 1, 1993 through September 30, 1994 was 4.0%. It is represented that, this fund, an investment
vehicle offered by Boatmen's Trust Company, invests in a diversified portfolio of money market instruments, such
as U.S. Treasury Bills, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and demand notes, as well as other fixed-rate
and variable-rate fixed income securities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Repayment of the Loan is limited to payments made to the Plan by or on behalf of Executive Life, or its successor, or
any other responsible third parties. No other assets of the Plan will be available for repayment of the Loan. If the
payments by or on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the Loan, the Employer will have no recourse
against the Plan, or against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plan, for the unpaid amount. In the event that
GIC proceeds exceed the amount necessary to repay the Loan, the excess will be distributed to the Plan for the benefit
of participants and their beneficiaries. The Employer represents that it will maintain records of the proposed Loan
for a period of seven years, and such records will be open for inspection at all times by the Department or any Plan participant.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction satisfies the criteria of section 408(a) of
the Act because: (1) The transaction will preserve the Plan's ability to allow participant-directed investment
re-allocations; (2) The Plan will not incur any expenses with respect to the transaction; (3) Repayment of the Loan
will be made only from amounts paid to the Plan by Executive Life, its successor, or any other third party; (4) If the
payments by or on behalf of Executive Life are not sufficient to fully repay the Loan, the Employer will have no recourse
against the Plan, or against any participants or beneficiaries of the Plan, for the unpaid amount; and (5) Repayment
of the Loan will be waived with respect to the amount by which the Loan exceeds the amount the Plan receives from GIC proceeds.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Regency Marketing Corporation (Regency) established the Plan on July 1, 1976. On February 1, 1986, the Plan was
frozen due to the dissolution of Regency. Regency was a Michigan corporation engaged as a broker of dairy and other
related products. As of June 30, 1993, the Plan had total assets of $1,892,429. Randall Heine and his wife, Paula Heine,
are the only participants in the Plan. Mr. and Mrs. Heine are the trustees of the Plan (the Trustees) and have sole investment

Mr. Heine is the majority shareholder of Frankenmuth, a Michigan corporation with its principal place of business
in Frankenmuth, Michigan. Frankenmuth manufactures beer and ale both under its own labels as well as under private
labels. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Trustees request an administrative exemption from the Department to permit the Loan to Frankenmuth under the
terms and conditions described herein. Frankenmuth proposes to use the loan proceeds towards purchasing the Property
which will be used for Frankenmuth's administrative offices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Loan will be in a principal amount of $84,667. The applicant states that at no time will the amount of the Loan represent
more than twenty-five percent of the Plan's total assets. The Loan will be secured by a first deed of trust on the Property,
which consists of a 1,250 square foot improved commercial building and the underlying land. The Property is located
at 435 South Main Street, Frankenmuth, Michigan. The deed of trust will be duly recorded in Saginaw County to reflect
the Plan's security interest in the Property. In addition, Frankenmuth will insure the Property against casualty
loss and designate the Plan as the loss payee of such insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Loan will have a ten-year term and will be evidenced by a promissory note (the Note). The Note will require Frankenmuth
to make monthly payments of principal and interest which will be fully amortized over the ten-year term. Interest
will accrue on the Loan at 11.5 percent per annum. The Plan will not be required to pay any commissions, fees or other
expenses in connection with the Loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As a condition of the proposed exemption, the terms and conditions of the Loan must be at least as favorable to the Plan

$84,667 for an initial term of five years with a fifteen-year amortization schedule allowing for a balloon payment
at the end of the fifth year. At the end of the first five years, NBD would approve a new five-year note with a ten-year
amortization schedule. At the end of the tenth year, NBD would then approve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a five-year note with a five-year amortization schedule. Interest would accrue within a range of 9.25 percent to 11.5
percent per annum, fixed or floating. In addition, NBD states that it would charge Frankenmuth a loan fee of one percent
or $846. Accordingly, the applicants represent that Frankenmuth will pay a loan fee of $846 to the Plan at the inception
of the Loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The Property was appraised by Lewis H. Weiss of Weiss Appraisal Service (Weiss), an appraisal firm located in Frankenmuth,
Michigan. Mr. Weiss is a licensed real estate appraiser in Michigan and has ten years of experience appraising all
types of property. Mr. Weiss represents that both he and Weiss are independent of, and unrelated to, Frankenmuth and
the Trustees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mr. Weiss placed a fair market value of $127,000 as of August 23, 1994. Mr. Weiss utilized the market data approach of
valuation by using comparable sales of commercial buildings located on the same street as the Property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The Trustees state that the terms of the Loan compare favorably with the terms of similar transactions between untreated
parties and would be a better than arm's length transaction as evidenced by the terms offered by NBD (see Item 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5 above). The Trustees represent, that from the Plan's perspective, the terms of the Loan are better than the terms
offered by NBD because the Loan allows the Plan to receive higher monthly payments at an interest rate of 11.5 percent
over a ten- year period rather than at a fixed or floating rate between 9.25 and 11.5 percent over a fifteen-year period.
The Trustees represent that they believe that the Loan is in the best interests of the Plan and its participants and
beneficiaries as an investment for the Plan's portfolio. The Trustees further represent that they will monitor the
Loan throughout its entire duration and will take any appropriate action necessary to protect the interests of the
Plan and its participants and beneficiaries, including a foreclosure on the Property in the event of default. The
Trustees will monitor the Property to ensure that the Loan remains secured by collateral worth at least 150 percent
of the Loan at all times.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
7. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an
exemption under section 408(a) of the Act because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) the terms of the Loan will be at least as favorable to the Plan as those obtainable in an arm's length transaction
with an unrelated party; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the Loan will not exceed twenty-five percent of the assets of the Plan at any time during the duration of the Loan;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) the Loan will be secured by a first deed of trust on certain real property (the Property) which has been appraised
by an independent, qualified appraiser to ensure that the fair market value of the Property is at least 150 percent
of the amount of the Loan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) the fair market value of the Property will remain at least equal to 150 percent of the outstanding balance of the
Loan throughout the duration of the Loan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) the Trustees have determined on behalf of the Plan that the Loan is in the best interest of the Plan and protective
of the Plan's participants and beneficiaries; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) the Trustees will monitor compliance with the terms and conditions of the Loan throughout the duration of the transaction,
taking any action necessary to safeguard the Plan's interest, including foreclosure on the Property in the event
of default.

Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Plan is a defined contribution plan that was established January 1, 1974. The Plan has 13 participants, and as
of December 31, 1993, the Plan's total assets were $755,525.96. The sponsor of the Plan is Clarendon Family Practice,
PA (the Employer), which is a South Carolina subchapter ``C'' corporation engaged in family practice medicine. The
Plan's trustee is Dr. Coker who is also the sole shareholder of the Employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On May 18, 1982, the Plan purchased the Land for $41,700 from Marian K. Thames, an unrelated third party in a one-time
cash transaction. The applicant represents that at the time of initial acquisition, the Land represented 19.9% of
the Plan's total assets. The Land consists of 8.34 acres of vacant land and is located adjacent to other property owned
by Dr. Coker, individually. The applicant represents that since 1982 the Land has been rented for approximately $400
a year to W. D. Harrington, a neighboring farmer who is unrelated to the Plan and the Employer, as grazing land for animals.
The aggregate rental income received by the Plan for the period 1982&hyph;1994 is $5,200. It is represented that the
Land has not been used by a party in interest since it was originally acquired by the Plan. Furthermore, the Land is not
encumbered by any debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Dr. Coker in his trustee capacity, upon the advise of a certain certified public accountant, made the original decision
to acquire the Land as a long-term Plan investment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 With respect to the Land, the aggregate real estate taxes for the period 1983&hyph;1993 were $153.45. In this regard,
the original acquisition cost (the Original Acquisition Cost) to the Plan for the Land is $36,653.45. The Original
Acquisition Cost was determined as follows $41,700 (original purchase price) + $153.45 (aggregate real estate taxes)
^ $5,200 (aggregate rental income) = $36,653.45.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. The Land was appraised on February 11, 1994 (the Appraisal) by W. Burke Watson, Jr., an independent real estate appraiser
certified in the State of South Carolina (Mr. Watson). Mr. Watson relied on the direct sales comparison method and
estimated that as of February 11, 1994, the fair market value of the Land was $12,500. On July 28, 1994, in an update to
the Appraisal, Mr. Burke stated that adjacency of the Land to other property owned by Dr. Coker merits a premium (the
Premium) above the fair market value of approximately $500 per acre, which yields a new purchase price of $17,680 to
Dr. Coker in this transaction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Dr. Coker proposes to purchase the Land from the Plan in a one-time cash transaction. It is represented that as of
December 31, 1993, the Land represented 1.7 percent of the Plan's assets. The applicant represents that the Land has
been depreciating steadily over the years, but that this depreciation became evident to Dr. Coker in 1987. As such,
after conferring with the Plan's consultants and administrators in 1991, Dr. Coker decided that he should sell the
Land because of its steady depreciation and because of its illiquidity. Accordingly, the Land has been listed for
sale with an independent real estate broker from October 1991 to January 1992, but there was no willing buyer. Therefore,
it is represented that the proposed transaction is in the best interest and protective of the Plan because the transaction
will divest the Plan of an asset that has greatly depreciated in value since original acquisition, and will enable
the Plan to invest in vehicles with a higher return. The transaction is protective of the Plan because as a result of
the sale the Plan will receive the higher of: a) the Original Acquisition Cost; or b) the current fair market value plus
the Premium as established at the time of the sale by an independent qualified appraiser. Furthermore, the applicant
represents that any amounts received by the Plan as a result of the proposed transaction, which are in excess of the
fair market value of the Land will be treated as a contribution to the Plan, but that this contribution will not exceed
limitations of section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In summary, the applicant represents that the transaction satisfies the statutory criteria of section 408(a)
of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code because: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) the proposed sale will be a one-time cash transaction; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) the Plan will receive the higher of: 1) the Original Acquisition Cost; or 2) the current fair market value plus the
Premium as established at the time of the sale by an independent qualified appraiser; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) the Plan will pay no expenses associated with the sale.

Tax Consequences of Transaction

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Department of Treasury has determined that if a transaction between a qualified employee benefit plan and its
sponsoring employer (or an affiliate thereof) results in the plan either paying less or receiving more than fair market
value, such excess may be considered to be a contribution by the sponsoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employer to the plan, and therefore must be examined under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, including 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sections 401(a)(4), 404 and 415.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Plan is a defined contribution 401(k) plan which provides for individual participant accounts (the Accounts)
and participant-directed investment of the Accounts. The Plan is sponsored by American Express Company (the Employer),
a New York public corporation engaged in diversified travel and financial services. The trustee of the Plan is the
IDS Trust Company (the Trustee), a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDS Financial Corporation, which is wholly owned by
the Employer. The Accounts are invested at the directions of individual Plan participants among nine investment
funds, one of which is the ISP Income Fund (the Income Fund), which invests in, among other things, guaranteed investment
contracts issued by insurance companies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Among the assets in the Income Fund are two guaranteed investment contracts (the GICs) issued by Confederation
Life Insurance Company (Confederation), a Canadian corporation doing business in the United States through branches
in Michigan and Georgia. Contract 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
62516 was issued to the Plan by Confederation effective June 28, 1991, upon an initial principal deposit of $10 million,
and it provides for simple annual interest at the rate of 8.72 percent, with a maturity date of June 27, 1996. Contract

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
62764 was issued effective June 1, 1993 upon an initial principal deposit of $5 million and it provides for simple annual
interest at the rate of 6.06 percent, with a maturity date of June 30, 1998. Both GICs are single-deposit non-participating
contracts which allow the Plan to make benefit-responsive withdrawals (the Withdrawals) to fund benefit payments,
investment fund transfers, hardship withdrawals and participant loans (collectively, the Withdrawal Events).
The terms of the GICs provide that interest at the interest rates guaranteed by each GIC (the Contract Rates) will be
credited to the Plan daily, and if the amount of interest earned exceeds the amount of Withdrawals, the difference
will be paid annually (the Interest Payments) on the anniversary of a date specified by each GIC for such Interest Payments.
Conversely, if the amount of Withdrawals exceeds the amount of interest earned during the year, no anniversary Interest
Payment is made. Upon each GIC's maturity date, Confederation is obligated to make a final cash payment to the Plan
(the Maturity Payment) in the amount of the GIC's principal plus interest at the Contract Rate, less previous Withdrawals
(the Maturity Value). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Employer represents that on August 11, 1994, the Canadian insurance regulatory authorities placed Confederation
into a liquidation and winding-up process, and on August 12, 1994, the insurance authorities of the State of Michigan
commenced legal action to place the U.S. operations of Confederation into a rehabilitation proceeding. As a result
of these actions, the Withdrawals and Interest Payments with respect to the GICs have been suspended.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Employer represents that it cannot be determined accurately whether, to what extent, or at what time the Withdrawals
and Interest Payments will be resumed. The Employer desires to alleviate the Plan's participants of the risks associated
with continued investment in the GICs, to prevent any losses of the Income Fund's investments in the GIC, and to provide
the Plan with the cash which otherwise would have been provided by the Withdrawals and Interest Payments. Accordingly,
the Employer proposes to make the Loans to the Plan from time to time in the amounts due the Plan under the GICs as Withdrawals
and Interest Payments. Upon the stated maturity date of each GIC, the Employer intends either (1) to purchase each
GIC from the Plan (the Sale), or, alternatively, (2) to make a Loan to the Plan in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value,
depending upon the circumstances prevailing at such time. The Employer is requesting an exemption to permit these
transactions under the terms and conditions described herein.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Department notes that the decisions to acquire and hold the GICs are governed by the fiduciary responsibility
requirements of Part 4, Subtitle B, Title I of the Act. In this proposed exemption, the Department is not proposing
relief for any violations of Part 4 which may have arisen as a result of the acquisition and holding of the GICs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
3. The Loans and their repayment, and any potential sale of the GICs to the Employer will be made pursuant to a written
agreement (the Agreement) between the Trustee and the Employer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Loans: Under the Agreement, the Employer agrees to make the Loans over the remaining terms of the GICs at such times
and in such amounts as required to enable the Income Fund to fully fund the Withdrawal Events and to fully realize the
Interest Payments, in lieu of the same amounts which otherwise would be paid to the Plan by Confederation as Withdrawals
and Interest Payments. Accordingly, the amount of each Loan will be determined on the basis of the GIC's principal
plus interest at the Contract Rate, less previous Withdrawals, as of the date of the Loan. Each Loan will also be reduced
by any amounts actually received by the Plan, with respect to the particular Withdrawal Event or Interest Payment
due, from Confederation or any other party making payment with respect to Confederation's obligations under the
GICs. In addition to the Loans in lieu of Withdrawals and Interest Payments, the Agreement authorizes the Employer,
as an alternative to purchasing the GICs (as described below in section 4) to make a final Loan with respect to each GIC
upon the GIC's Maturity Date in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value. Any final Loan upon the maturity of each GIC will
be made within thirty days of the Maturity Date in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value plus post-maturity interest
as described in section 4 below. The Employer will receive no interest or fees for any of the Loans, and the Plan will
incur no expenses related to the Loans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Repayments: The Agreement provides that the repayments of the Loans (the Repayments) with respect to each GIC
are restricted to the cash amounts, if any, which the Plan receives with respect to the GIC from Confederation, any
state insurance guaranty funds, any successor to Confederation, or any other third party making payments with respect
to Confederation's obligations under the GICs (collectively, the GIC Proceeds). The GIC Proceeds available to make
the Repayments also include, in the event of any purchase of either GIC, as described below, the purchase price of the
GIC (the Purchase Price). In this regard, in the event of any such sale of a GIC, Repayments of Loans with respect to that
GIC will be accomplished by crediting the total amount of outstanding Loans against the Purchase Price. In any event,
to the extent the Loans exceed total GIC Proceeds, the Repayments will be waived.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. With respect to the maturity of each GIC, the Agreement enables the Employer to retain the flexibility to decide
upon each GIC's maturity whether to make a final Loan in the amount of the Maturity Value, if not paid when due by or on
behalf of Confederation, or to purchase the GIC from the Plan. The Employer represents that it is unclear under current
conditions whether the purchase of the two GICs by the Employer would jeopardize the ability of the Plan and/or the
Employer to successfully assert rights to protection under the insurance guaranty fund laws of the various states.
The Employer is concerned that, if the two GICs are transferred from the Plan prior to resolution of issues related
to guaranty fund protection, various state guaranty fund associations may deny the full range of protection which
would have been conferred on the Plan and its participants through such insurance guaranty laws. For these reasons,
the Employer would like to wait until the maturity date of each GIC to determine whether to purchase the GIC from the
Plan or to make a Loan to the Plan in the amount of the GIC's Maturity Value. The Agreement requires the Employer to make
its decision with respect to the maturity of each GIC, and to consummate the Loan or purchase transaction, within thirty
business days after the maturity date of each GIC, during which the GIC's Maturity Value will earn interest (Post-Maturity
Interest) at the prevailing 30-day U.S. Treasury bill rate, from the date of maturity to the date of the loan or purchase.
In the event the Employer chooses to purchase either of the GICs, the purchase price will be cash in the amount of the
GIC's Maturity Value plus Post-Maturity Interest. The Plan will not incur any expenses related to any sale of the GICs.
In the event the Employer chooses to make a final Loan upon the Maturity of each GIC, each Loan will be in the amount of
the GIC's Maturity Value plus Post-Maturity Interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In summary, the Employer represents that the proposed transactions satisfy the criteria of section 408(a) of the
Act for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The transactions will enable the Plan to recover all amounts due with respect to the GICs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Loans will enable the Plan to resume the ability to fund benefit payments, participant loans, hardship withdrawals,
and investment fund transfers within the Plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Repayment of the Loans will be restricted to the GIC Proceeds; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Repayments will be waived to the extent the Loans exceed the GIC Proceeds; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) No interest and/or expenses will be incurred by the Plan with respect to any of the transactions.

The exemption, if granted, is temporary and will expire five years from the date of the publication in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary of Facts and Representations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Plan is defined contribution plan having 63 participants and total assets of $4,621,936 as of September 39,
1995. Richfield Bank &amp; Trust Company of Richfield, Minnesota serves as the Plan's trustee (the Trustee). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Employer is a closely held corporation engaged in the metal-stamping business. The shareholders of the Employer
are Fred P. Berdass and members of his family. In the regular course of its business, the Employer purchases equipment
for its operations. The Employer maintains its principal place of business in Circle Pines, Minnesota. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Department granted two previous exemptions (Prohibited Transaction Exemption (PTE) 82&hyph;9, 47 FR 2431,
January 15, 1982 and PTE 87&hyph;77, 52 FR 29905, August 12, 1987) to permit loans (the Exempt Loans) by the Plan to the
Employer. Under the terms of the exemption, the Plan could make loans on a recurring basis to the Employer for a period
of five years. The proceeds from the Exempt Loans were used by the Employer for the purchases of machinery and equipment.
Each Exempt Loan was collateralized by specific equipment and assets owned by the Employer. The maximum length of
any Exempt Loan was 48 months, and the interest rate was one percent above the prime rate. The balance on total Exempt
Loans did not exceed 25 percent of the fair market value of the Plan's assets. An independent fiduciary acted on behalf
of the Plan and certified that each Exempt Loan was an appropriate investment for the Plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Trustee has confirmed that all payments of principal Loans were received by the Trustee on a timely basis and each
Exempt Loan was paid in full in accordance with the terms of PTE 82&hyph;9 and PTE 87&hyph;77. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Plan now proposes to make a series of Loans over a five year period to the Employer. The proceeds from the Loans
will be used by the Employer to purchase the Equipment. Each Loan will be collateralized by a promissory note and security
agreement which provide the Plan with a first lien on the Equipment. In addition, the Loan will be collateralized by
specific equipment or assets which are owned by the Employer. At all times each Loan will be collateralized in an amount
at least equal to 200 percent of the outstanding balance of such loan. The amount of each Loan will not exceed 80% of the
purchase price of the Equipment excluding tax and transportation. In addition, Mr. Berdass will personally guarantee
each Loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The maximum length of any Loan will be 48 months and will have an interest rate of at least one percent above the prevailing
prime rate of interest of the Trustee which is the prevailing interest rate earned on similar loans made by the Trustee
to unrelated third parties. The outstanding Loan balance will not exceed 25 percent of the market value of the assets
of the Plan. The Employer will adequately insure the Equipment and all other collateral against fire and all other
relevant hazards with the Plan being named beneficiary of the insurance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Lake Elmo Bank, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota (the Bank) will serve as the independent fiduciary with respect to the proposed
Loans. The Bank represents that it is qualified to act as an independent fiduciary with respect to the Loan transactions
and that is understands that its responsibility as an ERISA fiduciary. In addition, the Bank represents that it has
no pre-existing relationship with the Employer nor with Mr. Berdass, and that the income derived from the Employer
and related parties, including the income derived from serving in the capacity of independent fiduciary will not
exceed 1% of the Bank's gross income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. In its capacity as independent fiduciary, the Bank represents that it will determine the appropriateness and suitability
of each Loan prior to the consummation of each Loan transaction. In this regard, the Bank will review the independent
appraisals of the Equipment and the assets pledged to secure the Loans and confirm the sufficiency of such appraisals.
The Bank states that the Loans are appropriate investments for the Plan and are in the best interests of the Plan's participants
and beneficiaries and are protective of their interests. The Bank further states that the terms of the Loans are at
least equal to terms available between the Plan and an unrelated third party. The Bank represents that it will enforce
the terms of the Loan including, but not limited to, making demand for timely payment, bringing suit or other appropriate
process against the Employer in the event of default and monitoring the performance of each Loan. In addition, the
Bank has examined Mr. Berdass's personal financial statements and is assured that as guarantor of the Loans, Mr. Berdass
will continue to have the financial stability to personally assure the repayment of all Loans granted pursuant to
the proposed exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. In summary, the applicant represents that the proposed transaction meets the statutory criteria for an exemption
under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the rate of return to the Plan on the Loans will equal the prevailing rate
earned on similar loans made by the Trustee; (b) the Plan's interests with respect to the Loans will be represented
by an independent fiduciary who will monitor the Loans as well as the conditions of the exemption, and will take all
appropriate actions necessary to safeguard the best interests of the Plan; (c) the Plan's independent fiduciary
has reviewed the terms and conditions of the proposed exemption and has determined that the Loans are in the best interest
of the Plan's participants and beneficiaries; (d) The independent fiduciary will review and approve each Loan prior
to making any disbursements; (e) the Loans will at all times be secured by the Equipment and other assets of the Employer
which will be valued at not less than 200% of the Loan; (f) the aggregate balance of the outstanding loans will not exceed
25% of the value of the Plan's assets; and (g) the proposed exemption will be of a temporary nature, not to exceed five
years.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest of disqualified person from certain other provisions
of the Act and/or the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply
and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a
fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries
of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(b) of the act; nor does it affect the requirement
of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining
the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Before an exemption may be granted under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code, the Department
must find that the exemption is administratively feasible, in the interests of the plan and of its participants and
beneficiaries and protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of the plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be supplemental to, and not in derogation of, any other provisions of
the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transitional rules. Furthermore,
the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the
transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed exemptions, if granted, will be subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application are true and complete, and that each application accurately describes all material
terms of the transaction which is the subject of the exemption.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This document contains exemptions issued by the Department of Labor (the Department) from certain of the prohibited
transaction restrictions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (the Act) and/or the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 (the Code). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the pendency before the Department of proposals to grant such exemptions. The notices set forth a summary of facts
and representations contained in each application for exemption and referred interested persons to the respective
applications for a complete statement of the facts and representations. The applications have been available for
public inspection at the Department in Washington, D.C. The notices also invited interested persons to submit comments
on the requested exemptions to the Department. In addition the notices stated that any interested person might submit
a written request that a public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hearing be held (where appropriate). The applicants have represented that they have complied with the requirements
of the notification to interested persons. No public comments and no requests for a hearing, unless otherwise stated,
were received by the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The notices of proposed exemption were issued and the exemptions are being granted solely by the Department because,
effective December 31, 1978, section 102 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978 (43 FR 47713, October 17, 1978) transferred
the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to issue exemptions of the type proposed to the Secretary of Labor.

II. General Conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. The relief provided under Part I is available only if the following conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The acquisition of certificates by a plan is on terms (including the certificate price) that are at least as favorable
to the plan as they would be in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The rights and interests evidenced by the certificates are not subordinated to the rights and interests evidenced
by other certificates of the same trust; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The certificates acquired by the plan have received a rating at the time of such acquisition that is in one of the
three highest generic rating categories from either Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation (S&amp;P's), Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. (Moody's), Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. (D &amp; P) or Fitch Investors Service, Inc. (Fitch); 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The trustee is not an affiliate of any member of the Restricted Group. However, the trustee shall not be considered
to be an affiliate of a servicer solely because the trustee has succeeded to the rights and responsibilities of the
servicer pursuant to the terms of a pooling and servicing agreement providing for such succession upon the occurrence
of one or more events of default by the servicer; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The sum of all payments made to and retained by the underwriters in connection with the distribution or placement
of certificates represents not more than reasonable compensation for underwriting or placing the certificates;
the sum of all payments made to and retained by the sponsor pursuant to the assignment of obligations (or interests
therein) to the trust represents not more than the fair market value of such obligations (or interests); and the sum
of all payments made to and retained by the servicer represents not more than reasonable compensation for the servicer's
services under the pooling and servicing agreement and reimbursement of the servicer's reasonable expenses in connection
therewith; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The plan investing in such certificates is an ``accredited investor'' as defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. Neither any underwriter, sponsor, trustee, servicer, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insurer, or any obligor, unless it or any of its affiliates has discretionary authority or renders investment advice
with respect to the plan assets used by a plan to acquire certificates, shall be denied the relief provided under Part
I, if the provision of subsection II.A.(6) above is not satisfied with respect to acquisition or holding by a plan of
such certificates, provided that (1) such condition is disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum;
and (2) in the case of a private placement of certificates, the trustee obtains a representation from each initial
purchaser which is a plan that it is in compliance with such condition, and obtains a covenant from each initial purchaser
to the effect that, so long as such initial purchaser (or any transferee of such initial purchaser's certificates)
is required to obtain from its transferee a representation regarding compliance with the Securities Act of 1933,
any such transferees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be required to make a written representation regarding compliance with the condition set forth in subsection
II.A.(6) above.

purchase or sale of one or more certificates to be delivered at an agreed future settlement date. The term includes

owing in respect of the obligations;

(4) the amount paid to investors in the trust will

T. ``Qualified Equipment Note Secured By A Lease'' means an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment note: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) which is secured by equipment which is leased;

(2) which is secured by the obligation of the lessee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pay rent under the equipment lease; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) with respect to which the trust's security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interest in the equipment is at least as protective of the rights of the trust as the trust would have if the equipment

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U. ``Qualified Motor Vehicle Lease'' means a lease of a motor vehicle where:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
motor vehicle; and

establishing a trust. In the case of certificates which are denominated as debt instruments, ``Pooling and Servicing

(the Plan or Plans) that are either held in certain collective investment funds (the CIF or CIFs) maintained by the

the Plans, in exchange for shares of such Funds; provided that the following conditions are met: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) A fiduciary (the Second Fiduciary) who is acting on behalf of each affected Plan and who is independent of and unrelated
to the Bank, as defined in paragraph (g) of section III below, receives advance written notice of the in-kind transfer
of assets of the Plans or the CIFs in exchange for shares of the Fund and the disclosures described in paragraph (g) of
section II below; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) On the basis of the information described in paragraph (g) of section II below, the Second Fiduciary authorizes
in writing the in-kind transfer of assets of the Plans in exchange for shares of the Funds, the investment of such assets
in corresponding portfolios of the Funds, and the fees received by the Bank in connection with its services to the Fund.
Such authorization by the Second Fiduciary to be consistent with the responsibilities, obligations, and duties
imposed on fiduciaries by Part 4 of Title I of the Act;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) No sales commissions are paid by the Plans in connection with the in-kind transfers of asset of the Plans or the CIFs
in exchange for shares of the Funds;

Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time or any successor rule, regulation, or similar pronouncement, and
the procedures established by the Funds pursuant to Rule 17a&hyph;7 for the valuation of such assets. Such procedures
must require that all securities for which a current market price cannot be obtained by reference to the last sale price
for transactions reported on a recognized securities exchange or NASDAQ be valued based on an average of the highest
current independent bid and lowest current independent offer, as of the close of business on the Friday preceding
the weekend of the Plan or CIF transfers determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry from at least three sources that
are broker-dealers or pricing services independent of the Bank; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

preclude the payment of investment advisory fees or similar fees by the Funds to the Bank under the terms of an investment
advisory agreement adopted in accordance with section 15 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or other agreement
between the Bank and the Funds; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

or from the decrease in the number or kind of services performed by the Bank for such fee over an existing rate for such
Secondary Service which had been authorized by the Second Fiduciary of a Plan, in accordance with paragraph (h) of
this section II, the Bank will at least thirty (30) days in advance of the implementation of such additional service
for which a fee is charged or fee increase, provide a written notice (which may take the form of a proxy statement, letter,
or similar communication that is separate from the prospectus of the Fund and which explains the nature and amount
of the additional service for which a fee is charged or the nature and amount of the increase in fees) to the Second Fiduciary
of each of the Plans invested in a Fund which is adding a service or increasing fees. Such notice shall be accompanied
by the Termination Form, as defined in paragraph (i) of section III below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

day following receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery, facsimile, or other available means at the option

to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale of shares of such Plans cannot be executed within one business
day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) failure by the Second Fiduciary to return the Termination Form on behalf of a Plan will be deemed to be an approval
of the additional Secondary Service for which a fee is charged or increase in the rate of any fees, if such Termination
Form is supplied pursuant to paragraphs (k) and (l) of this section II, and will result in the continuation of the authorization,
as described in paragraph (h) of this section II, of the Bank to engage in the transactions on behalf of such Plan; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(n) The Second Fiduciary is supplied with a Termination Form, annually during the first quarter of each calendar year,

In the Notice of Proposed Exemption (the Notice), the Department invited all interested persons to submit written
comments and requests for a hearing on the proposed exemption within sixty (60) days of the date of the publication
of the Notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 17, 1994. All comments and requests for hearing were due by October 17, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the comment period, the Department received no requests for a hearing. However, the Department did receive
a comment letter from the applicant, dated October 17, 1994. The comment from the applicant requested certain modifications
and clarifications of the conditions of the exemption and certain corrections of the language of the Summary of Facts
and Representation in the Notice. The applicant's comments are as follows:

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
First, the Bank requests modification of the language in Section I(f). This section provides in relevant part that,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The value of the assets of the Plans or the CIFs to be transferred in-kind 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and the net asset value of the Funds receiving those assets 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in exchange for shares is determined in a single valuation performed in the same manner and at the close of business
on the same day, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 17a&hyph;7(b) (Rule 17a&hyph;7) under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended from time to time or any successor rule, regulation, or similar pronouncement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
(Emphasis added). In this regard, the Bank indicated that the valuation procedures described in Rule 17a&hyph;7
were used to value the CIF securities transferred to the Funds in the ``conversion'' transaction that occurred on
November 12, 1993, for which retroactive relief has been requested. Further, in connection with the determination
of the net asset value of the Funds' shares to be transferred to the CIFs in that transaction, the trustees of the HighMark
Group (HighMark) decided to use Rule 17a&hyph;7 procedures to value certain securities held in the portfolios of
the Funds in cases where those securities were the same as the securities being transferred to the Funds by the CIFs.
However, it is represented that Rule 17a&hyph;7 procedures were not used to determine the value of other securities
held in the Fund portfolios where those securities were not the same as those held by the CIFs. The values of such other
Fund securities were instead determined pursuant to procedures permitted under the Investment Company Act and normally
followed by HighMark in determining net asset value. The Bank maintains that it did not intend as a condition of the
exemption that Rule 17a&hyph;7 valuation procedures be used to determine the value of all of the Fund's assets for
purposes of ascertaining the number of shares to be issued in connection with a conversion. The Bank believes that
the best approach is to require both parties to a conversion (e.g., a CIF and a Fund) to use the same procedures to value
any securities that are held by both parties, but that compliance with the valuation requirements of Rule 17a&hyph;7
should be required only with respect to securities held by a party (such as a CIF) that is not a registered investment
company. In the opinion of the Bank, this would provide assurance that assets transferred in a conversion transaction
are priced appropriately without interfering with the procedures normally employed by a registered investment
company in determining its net asset value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In this regard, the Department believes that the most important consideration is that the value of the securities
transferred by the Plan or the CIF into the Fund equal the value of the units of the Fund received in exchange for such
securities by the Plan. Accordingly, we believe that the securities transferred must be valued under the same procedures
by both the transferee and transferor entity (e.g. a CIF and a Fund). In response to the comment, the Department has
reviewed its policies concerning valuation in these types of transactions and has decided to implement the following
changes. The word, ``are,'' before the word, ``value,'' should be deleted and the language of Section I(e) amended
to read as follows: ``The Plans or the CIFs receive shares of the Funds that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
have a total net asset 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
value equal in value to the assets of the Plans or the CIFs exchanged for such shares 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
on the date of transfer
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' (The New language is italicized). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department concurs with the applicant's request that Section I(f) be amended by deleting the phrase, ``and the
net asset value of the Funds receiving those assets,'' from the language quoted above to provide that Rule 17a&hyph;7
procedures are required to value only assets being transferred to a Fund, and not the assets of the Fund itself. In this
connection, the Department has amended the language of Section I(f) to read as follows: ``The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
current market 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
value of the assets of the Plans or the CIFs to be transferred in-kind in exchange for shares is determined in a single
valuation performed in the same manner and at the close of business on the same day, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
using independent sources 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 17a&hyph;7(b) (Rule 17a&hyph;7) under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended from time to time or any successor rule, regulation, or similar pronouncement, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and the procedures established by the Funds pursuant to Rule 17a&hyph;7 for the valuation of such assets. Such procedures
must require that all securities for which a current market price cannot be obtained by reference to the last sale price
for transactions reported on a recognized securities exchange or NASDAQ be valued based on an average of the highest
current independent bid and lowest current independent offer, as of the close of business on the Friday preceding
the weekend of the Plan or CIF transfers determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry from at least three sources that
are broker-dealers or pricing services independent of the Bank. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(The new language is italicized). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bank in another comment requests a modification of the language of Section II(i) and the parallel language in Section
II(m)(1) and Section III(i). The language in these sections requires the Bank to sell Fund shares within one business
day after receipt by the Bank, either by mail, hand delivery, facsimile, or other available means of the Termination
Form or any other written notice from the Second Fiduciary terminating its authorization of investments in the Fund.
The language of these sections provides that if due to circumstances beyond the control of the Bank, the sale cannot
be executed within one business day, the Bank shall have one additional business day to complete such sale. The Bank
believes that the circumstances that may prevent the Bank from completing a sale within one business day (e.g., natural
disaster) may, as a practical matter, also prevent completion of such sale by the second day. Accordingly, the Bank
suggests that the language be amended to make clear that a prohibited transaction will not be considered to have occurred
in such circumstances, if the Bank, due to circumstances that could not be reasonably foreseen by the Bank, is further
prevented from completing the sale by the end of the additional business day. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department believes that the two business day requirement provides ample opportunity for the Bank to execute
sales of shares in the Funds, even in the event circumstances arise which could not reasonably have been foreseen by
the Bank. Accordingly, the Department does not believe that the modification proposed by the Bank would be in the interest
of the Plans, and has determined not to revise the exemption in this manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bank also requested a clarification of the scope of relief provided by Section II of the proposed exemption. In
this regard, the language of Section II, as published in the Notice, provides relief from ``the sanctions resulting
from the application of section 4975 of the Code by reason of section 4975(c)(1) (D) through (F) of the Code.'' The Bank
believes that the reference to section 4975(c)(1)(D) is a typographical error and requests that the exemption be
corrected to include relief from section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (F) of the Code in order to conform with the scope of
relief provided to other applicants for substantially similar transactions. The Department concurs and has amended
the exemption accordingly.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Bank also commented on section I wherein it is stated that the Plans involved in the transaction are Plans for which
the Bank serves as trustee, investment manager, or in any other capacity as fiduciary on behalf of the Plan, and on section
II wherein it is stated that the Plans involved in the transaction are Plans for which the Bank serves as fiduciary.
The Bank states that although its original application referred to Plans for which it exercised investment discretion,
it wishes to note for the record that it also serves Plans in other fiduciary capacities that do not involve the exercise
of investment responsibility. In this regard, in addition to the representations contained in paragraph 2 of the
Notice, as of the time of the application, the Bank had custody of approximately $2.5 billion in assets from approximately
1,500 plans for which the Bank does not exercise investment responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In response to this comment, the Department acknowledges this additional information. However, the Department
wishes to reiterate that it is not granting relief for transactions afforded relief by Section 404(c) of the Act nor
relief for transactions involving any plan sponsored by the Bank or its affiliates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bank in its comment letter also requests further modifications and updates to the language of the Summary of Facts
and Representations, as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Specifically, the Bank requests that representations at pages 42293 through 42294 in Notice be changed to reflect
the fact that HighMark now has eleven (11) portfolios, having established in November 1993, four (4) new non-money
market portfolios, namely the Growth Fund, the Income &amp; Growth Fund, the Balanced Fund, and the Government Bond
Fund, and having merged the Special Growth Equity and Growth Funds in May 1994. It is further represented that the Bank
continues to serve as investment adviser, sub-administrator, sub-transfer agent and custodian, but does not serve
as sub-accountant to HighMark. The Department notes that this additional information will be included in the record
of the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bank also requests clarification of the language of the fourth sentence of paragraph 3 of the Summary of Facts and
Representation, as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In this regard, the Bank wishes to confirm that the exemption does not preclude the Bank from relying on any other available
exemption (e.g., Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 84&hyph;24 or Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption
77&hyph;4), if the terms and conditions of such exemptions are satisfied and if the Bank deems it appropriate to do
so in a given situation. The Department concurs in this comment, but expresses no opinion regarding the availability
of those exemptions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Bank also comments that the first sentence of paragraph 5 of the Summary of Facts and Representations in the Notice
could be read to suggest that the Bank believes that in-kind transfers of the type covered by Section I of the exemption
are not covered by Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 77&hyph;4. While the Bank represents that it intends to
follow the requirements of Section I of the exemption in connection with such in-kind transfers, the Bank reiterates
that its position was and is that such transfers also are within the scope of Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption
77&hyph;4. The Department notes that it has formally expressed its view on this issue. Specifically, the Department
has concluded that the relief provided by Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 77&hyph;4 is unavailable for the
purchase of shares in mutual funds other than for cash. (See footnote 3 in Advisory Opinion 94&hyph;35A, dated November
3, 1994). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the Bank wishes to update in three particulars the description of the Bank's automated ``sweep'' service
described in the Summary of Facts and Representations, as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. In this regard, language in the first paragraph in paragraph 14 of the Notice indicates that purchases and sales of
shares in any of the Funds by the Plans may also occur in connection with daily automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements,
but that agreement to such an arrangement is not a condition for the Plan otherwise choosing to invest in shares of the
Fund, nor will the reverse be required. The Bank maintains that the meaning of the phrase, ``nor will the reverse be
required'' is unclear. It is the Bank's position that, in the exercise of its business judgment regarding the structure
and characteristics of any sweep services it may wish to offer, it may choose to limit investment vehicles made available
under any sweep program to shares of a designated Fund. The Department notes that the sentence in which the phrase,
``nor will the reverse be required,'' appeared was intended to mean that Plans may participate in automated cash ``sweep''
arrangements involving the Funds without being required to invest other plan assets in shares of the Funds and that
Plans may invest in the Funds without being required also to participate in automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements
offered by the Bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the Bank wishes to correct a representation in the second paragraph of paragraph 14 of the Notice which states,
in part, that ``all of the Plans served by the Bank had elected to participate in automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements
with HighMark.'' According to the Bank, this representation should read that ``substantially all'' of the Plans
served by the Bank had elected to participate in automated cash ``sweep'' arrangements with HighMark. The Department
concurs and incorporates this information into the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, the Bank seeks clarification of the second sentence of the third paragraph of paragraph 14 of the Notice. In
the opinion of the Bank, the sentence could be read to suggest that the ``sweep'' program for a given Plan may involve
investments in more than one of the HighMark money market portfolios at the same time. The Bank represents that while
a Plan may choose from among several such portfolios of HighMark, the ``sweep'' arrangement for a given Plan involves
automatic investments in shares of only one such portfolio at a time. The Department concurs and incorporates the
information on the ``sweep'' program into the exemption. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After giving full consideration to the entire record, including the written comment from the Bank, the Department
has decided to grant the exemption, as described and concurred in above. In this regard, the comment letter submitted
by the Bank to the Department has been included as part of the public record of the exemption application. The complete
application file, including all supplemental submissions received by the Department, is made available for public
inspection in the Public Documents Room of the Pension Welfare Benefits Administration, Room N&hyph;5638, U.S.
Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210.

exemption refer to the notice of proposed exemption published on Wednesday, August 17, 1994, at 59 FR 42289.

General Information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2)
of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions
to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act,
which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of
the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of
the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive
benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code,
including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction
is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited
transaction; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations
contained in each application accurately describes all material terms of the transaction which is the subject of
the exemption.

Northern States Power Company; Withdrawal of Application for Amendments to Facility Operating Licenses
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has granted the request of Northern States Power Company
(the licensee) to withdraw its July 13, 1992, application for proposed amendments to Facility Operating License
Nos. DPR&hyph;42 and DPR&hyph;60 for the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, respectively,
located in Goodhue County, Minnesota.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendments would have revised the facility technical specifications to clarify the applicability
of the requirements for containment closure during refueling and to clarify the requirements for operability and
load testing of the fuel handling cranes. The Commission had previously issued a Notice of Consideration of Issuance
of Amendments published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 5, 1992 (57 FR 34588). However, by letter dated July 5, 1994, the licensee withdrew the proposed changes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the application for amendment dated July 13, 1992, and the licensee's
letter dated July 5, 1994, which withdrew the application for license amendment. The above documents are available

<DOCTITLE>In the Matter of Rex Allen Werts (Also Known As: Michael Allen Hunter); Order Prohibiting Involvement in NRC-Licensed
Activities and Unescorted Access (Effective Immediately)</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

I
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Mr. Rex Allen Werts (Also Known As: Michael Allen Hunter) was employed by Power Plant Maintenance, Inc., (PPM) a contractor
of the Carolina Power and Light Company (CP&amp;L or Licensee), from March 24, 1993 until his unescorted access was
revoked on July 26, 1993. Licensee is the holder of License Nos. DPR&hyph;62 and DPR&hyph;71 issued by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 50 on December 27, 1974 and November 12, 1976, respectively.
The licenses authorize the operation of the Brunswick Nuclear Plant in accordance with the conditions specified
therein. The facility is located on the Licensee's site in Southport, North Carolina.

II
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On March 24, 1993, Mr. Werts was granted unescorted access to the Brunswick Nuclear Plant, based in part on representations
he made on an access authorization application, dated March 11, 1993, which he submitted to Power Plant Maintenance,
Inc., (PPM), a contractor of the Licensee. In the application, Mr. Werts falsely represented himself as Michael Allen
Hunter and stated that he had not been arrested or convicted of any criminal offense. In addition, Mr. Werts failed
to correct that information after he was granted unescorted access and continued to hold that status on the basis of
his false identity. The Licensee submitted fingerprint cards completed by Mr. Werts to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) and subsequently was informed that Mr. Werts (alias Mr. Hunter) had a record of arrests, convictions, and imprisonments
prior to 1990.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the above, Mr. Werts engaged in deliberate misconduct in violation of 10 CFR 50.5(a)(2) which prohibits any
employee of a licensee or licensee contractor from deliberately submitting to the licensee or licensee's contractor
information the employee knows to be incomplete or inaccurate in some respect material to the NRC. Information concerning
an individual's true identity and criminal history is material in that it is used by the Licensee to make determinations
relative to the grant or denial access authorization. If the Licensee has been given accurate information regarding
Mr. Werts' criminal record the Licensee would not have granted unescorted access to Mr. Werts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC must be able to rely on the Licensee, its contractors, and licensee and contractor employees to comply with
NRC requirements, including the requirement to provide information that is complete and accurate in all material
respects. Mr. Werts' actions have raised serious concerns as to whether he can be relied upon to comply with NRC requirements
and to provide complete and accurate information to the NRC or NRC licensees in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, I lack the requisite reasonable assurance that nuclear safety activities can be conducted in compliance
with the Commission's requirements and that the health and safety of the public would be protected if Mr. Werts were
permitted at this time to be involved in the performance of licensed activities or were permitted unescorted access
to protected or vital areas of NRC-licensed facilities. Therefore, the public health, safety and interest require
that Mr. Werts be prohibited from being involved in the performance of activities licensed by the NRC and be prohibited
from obtaining unescorted access for a period of three years from the date of this Order. For a period of five years from
the date of this Order, Mr. Werts is required to inform the NRC of his acceptance of employment with any employer whose
operations he knows or has reason to believe involve NRC-licensed activities. Furthermore, pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202,
I find that the significance of the deliberate misconduct described above is such that the public health, safety and
interest require that this Order be immediately effective.

IV
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly, pursuant to sections 103, 161b, 161i, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the
Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 2.202, 10 CFR 50.5, and 10 CFR 150.20, It is hereby ordered, effective immediately,
that:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A. For a three-year period from the date of this Order, Mr. Rex Allen Werts is prohibited from engaging in activities
licensed by the NRC and is prohibited from obtaining unescorted access to protected and vital areas of facilities
licensed by the NRC. For the purposes of this Order, licensed activities include the activities licensed or regulated
by: (1) NRC; (2) an Agreement State, limited to the Licensee's conduct of activities within NRC jurisdiction pursuant
to 10 CFR 150.20; and (3) an Agreement State where the licensee is involved in the distribution of products that are
subject to NRC jurisdiction.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
B. For a five-year period from the date of this Order, Mr. Werts is required to provide notice to the Director, Office
of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, of his acceptance of employment with
any employer whose operations he knows or has reason to believe involve NRC-licensed activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Director, Office of Enforcement, may, in writing, relax or rescind any of the above conditions upon demonstration
by Mr. Werts of good cause.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 10 CFR 2.202, Mr. Werts must, and any other person adversely affected by this Order may, submit an
answer to this Order, and may request a hearing on this Order, within 20 days of the date of this Order. The answer may
consent to this Order. Unless the answer consents to this Order, the answer shall, in writing and under oath or affirmation,
specifically admit or deny each allegation or charge made in this Order and shall set forth the matters of fact and law
on which Mr. Werts or other person adversely affected relies and the reasons as to why the Order should not have been
issued. Any answer or request for a hearing shall be submitted to the Secretary, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
ATTN: Chief, Docketing and Services Section, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Director, Office
of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, to the Assistant General Counsel for
Hearings and Enforcement at the same address, to the Regional Administrator, Region II, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, 101 Marietta St. NW., Atlanta, Georgia 30323, and to Mr. Werts, if the answer or hearing request is by a
person other than Mr. Werts. If a person other than Mr. Werts requests a hearing, that person shall set forth with particularity
the manner in which his interest is adversely affected by this Order and shall address the criteria set forth in 10 CFR
2.714(d).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested by Mr. Werts or a person whose interest is adversely affected, the Commission will issue an
Order designating the time and place of any hearing. If a hearing is held, the issue to be considered at such hearing
shall be whether this Order should be sustained.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 2.202(c)(2)(i), Mr. Werts, or any other person adversely affected by this Order, may, in addition
to demanding a hearing, at the time the answer is filed or sooner, move the presiding officer to set aside the immediate
effectiveness of the Order on the ground that the Order, including the need for immediate effectiveness, is not based
on adequate evidence but on mere suspicion, unfounded allegations, or error.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of any request for a hearing, the provisions specified in Section IV above shall be final 20 days from
the date of this Order without further order or proceedings. An answer or a request for a hearing shall not stay the immediate
effectiveness of this order.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Cavalier Homes, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''),
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2&hyph;2(d) promulgated thereunder,
to withdraw the above specified security (``Security'') from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``Amex.'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing the security from listing and registration include the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's common stock commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on December 5,
1994 and concurrently therewith such securities were suspended from trading on the Amex.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In making the decision to withdraw its common stock from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and
indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its securities on the NYSE and on the Amex.
The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its common stock and believes that dual listing
would fragment the market for its security.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any interested person may, on or before January 5, 1995 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been
made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the
protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the
application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. FKLA, a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of Illinois, is the depositor of the Separate Account.
FKLA offers life insurance and annuity products and is admitted to do business in the District of Columbia and in all
states except New York. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Separate Account was established under Illinois law as a separate account of FKLA. The Separate Account, registered
under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust, will fund the Contracts issued by FKLA. The Contracts will be registered
under the Securities Act of 1933. The Kemper Investors Fund (the ``Fund''), a registered open-end management investment
company, will serve as the underlying investment medium for the Separate Account.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. KFS, a registered broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is the principal underwriter for the
Contracts, and will be the principal underwriter of any other variable life insurance policies funded through the
Separate Account or any Future Account (``Future Contracts'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Contracts are flexible premium individual variable life insurance policies. Applicants represent that the
Contracts will be issued in reliance on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(i)(B) under the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. FLKA will deduct a charge of 1.00% of each premium payment under the Contracts to cover a portion of FKLA's estimated
cost for higher federal corporate income tax liability resulting from changes made to the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 (``Code'') by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (``OBRA''), affecting the treatment of deferred
acquisition costs. The requested order also would permit the deduction of up to 1.25% of each premium payment under
Future Contracts.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. OBRA amended the Code by, among other things, enacting Section 848 thereof. Section 848 changed how a life insurance
company must compute its itemized deductions from gross income for federal income tax purposes. Section 848 requires
an insurance company to capitalize and amortize, over a period of ten years, part of the company's general expenses
for the current year. Under prior law, these general expenses were deductible in full from the current year's gross
income.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The amount of deductions that must be capitalized and amortized over ten years, rather than deducted in the year
incurred, is based on ``net premiums'' received in connection with certain types of insurance contracts. Section
848 of the Code defines ``net premium'' for a type of contract as gross premiums received by the insurance company on
the contracts minus return premiums and premiums paid by the insurance company for reinsurance of its obligations
under such contracts. Applicants state that the effect of Section 848 is to accelerate the realization of income from
insurance contracts covered by that Section, and, accordingly, the payment of taxes on the income generated by those
contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. The amount of general deductions that must be capitalized depends upon the type of contract to which the premiums
received relate and varies according to a schedule set forth in Section 848. Applicants represent that the Contracts
are ``specified insurance contracts'' that fall into the category of life insurance contracts, and, under Section
848, 7.7% of the year's net premiums received must be capitalized and amortized.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicants represent that the increased tax burden resulting from Section 848 may be quantified as follows. For
each $10,000 of net premiums received under the Contracts in a given year, Section 848 requires FKLA to capitalize
$770 (7.7% of $10,000) and $38.50 of this $770 may be deducted in the current year. This leaves $731.50 ($770 minus $38.50)
subject to taxation at the corporate tax rate of 35% which results in FKLA owing $256.03 (.35 &times; $731.50) more
in taxes for the current year than would have been owed prior to OBRA. This current increase in federal income tax will
be partially offset by deductions that will be allowed during the next ten years as a result of amortizing the remainder
of the $770 ($77 in each of the following nine years and $38.50 in the tenth year).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. In FKLA's business judgment, a discount rate of 8% is appropriate for use in calculating the present value of the
increased future tax deductions resulting from the amortization described above. Applicants state that FKLA seeks
an after tax rate of return on the investment of its capital in excess of 15%. To the extent that capital must be used by
FKLA to meets its increased federal tax burden under Section 848 resulting from the receipt of premiums, such capital
is not available to FKLA for investment. Thus, Applicants argue, the cost of capital used to satisfy FKLA's increased
federal income tax burden under Section 848 is, in essence, FKLA's after tax rate of return on capital; and, accordingly,
the rate of return on capital is appropriate for use in this present value calculation. To the extent that the 8% discount
rate is lower than FKLA's actual targeted rate of return, Applicants submit that a measure of comfort is provided that
the calculation of FKLA's increased tax burden attributable to the receipt of premiums will continue to be reasonable
over time, even if the corporate tax rate applicable to FKLA is reduced, or its targeted rate of return is lowered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. In determining the after tax rate of return used in arriving at this discount rate, Applicants state that a number
of factors were considered, including: market interest rates; FKLA's anticipated long term growth rate; the risk
level for this type of business; inflation; and available information about the rates of return obtained by other
life insurance companies. FKLA represents that such factors are appropriate factors to consider in determining
FKLA's cost of capital. Applicants state that FKLA first projects its future growth rate based on the anticipated
sales, the current interest rates, the inflation rate, acceptable risk levels, the amount of capital that FKLA can
provide to support such growth, and industry practice. FKLA then uses the anticipated growth rate and the other factors
enumerated above to set a rate of return on capital that equals or exceeds this rate of growth. Of these other factors,
market interest rates, the acceptable risk levels and the inflation rate receive significantly more weight than
information about the rates of return obtained by other companies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. Applicants state that FKLA seeks to maintain a ratio of capital to assets that is established based on its judgment
of the risks represented by various components of its assets and liabilities. Applicants state that maintaining
the ratio of capital to assets is critical to offering competitively priced products and, as to FKLA, to maintaining
a competitive rating from various rating agencies. Consequently, Applicants state that FKLA's capital should grow
at least at the same rate as do its assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. Using a corporate federal income tax rate of 35% and assuming a discount rate of 8%, the present value of the federal
income tax effect of the increased deductions allowable in the following 10 years, which partially offsets the increased
federal income tax burden, comes to $174.60. The effect of Section 848 on the Contracts is, therefore, an increased
federal income tax burden with a present value of $81.43 for each $10,000 of net premiums, i.e., $256.03 minus $174.60.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
14. State premium taxes are deductible in computing federal income taxes. Thus, FKLA does not incur incremental federal
income tax when it passes on state premium taxes to owners of the Contracts. Conversely, federal income taxes are not
deductible in computing FKLA's federal income taxes. To compensate FKLA fully for the impact of Section 848, therefore,
it would be necessary to allow FKLA to impose an additional charge that would make it whole not only for the $81.43 additional
federal income tax burden attributable to Section 848 but also for the federal income tax on the additional $81.43
itself. This federal income tax can be determined by dividing $81.43 by the complement of the 35% federal corporate
income tax rate, i.e., 65%, resulting in an additional charge of $125.28 for each $10,000 of net premiums, or 1.25%.
However, FKLA currently intends to deduct 1.00% of each premium payment under the Contracts, which is less than its
increased federal corporate income tax burden. FKLA reserves the rights to increase the charge and to deduct up to
1.25% of each premium payment of Future Contracts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
15. Based on prior experience, FKLA expects that all of its current and future deductions will be fully taken. Applicants
represent that the maximum 1.25% charge, and the current 1.00% charge, to be deducted pursuant to the relief requested,
are reasonably related to their increased federal income tax burden under Section 848, taking into account the capitalization
and amortization permitted by Section 848, and the use by FKLA of a discount rate of 8% in computing the future deductions
resulting from such capitalization and amortization, such rate being lower than, but assumed for these purposes
to be the equivalent of, FKLA's cost of capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. While the application states that FKLA believes that a charge of 1.00% of premium payments would reimburse it for
the impact of Section 848 (as currently written) on FKLA's federal income tax liabilities, the application also states,
however, that FKLA believes that it will have to increase this charge if any future change in, or interpretation of
Section 848, or any successor provision, results in an increased federal income tax burden due to the receipt of premiums.
Such an increase could result from a change in the corporate federal income tax rate, a change in the 7.7% figure, a change
in the categorization of specified insurance contracts, or a change in the amortization period.

 Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants request an order to the Commission pursuant to Section 6(c) exempting them from the provisions of Section
27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4)(v) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4)(v) thereunder, to the extent necessary
to permit deductions to be made from premium payments received in connection with the Contracts. The deductions would
be in an amount that is reasonable in relation to the increased federal income tax burden related to the receipt of such
premiums. Applicants further request an exemption from Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4) under the
1940 Act to premit the proposed deductions to be treated as other than ``sales load'' for the purposes of Section 27
of the 1940 and the exemptions from various provisions of that Section found in Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in pertinent part, that the Commission may by order upon application, conditionally
or unconditionally exempt any person, security or transaction from any provision of the 1940 Act if and to the extent
that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors
and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and the provisions of the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits the sale of periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of
all payments (except such amounts as are deducted for sales load) are held under an indenture or agreement containing
in substance the provisions required by Sections 26(a)(2) and 26(a)(3) of the 1940 Act. Certain provisions of Rules
6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) provide a range of exemptive relief for the offering of variable life insurance policies
such as the Contracts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
4. Rule 6e&hyph;2(c)(4)(v) defines ``sales load'' charged on any payment as the excess of the payment over certain
specified charges and adjustments, including ``a deduction approximately equal to state premium taxes''. Rule
6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4)(v) defines ``sales load'' charged during a contract period as the excess of any payments made
during the period over the sum of certain specified charges and adjustments, including ``a deduction for and approximately
equal to state premium taxes.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicants submit that the deduction for federal income tax charges, proposed to be deducted in connection with
the Contracts, should be treated as other than sales load, as is a state premium tax charge, for purposes of the 1940
Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants argue that the requested exemptions from Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4) and 6e&hyph;3(c)(4) are necessary
in connection with Applicant's reliance on certain provisions of Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(13) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13),
which provide exemptions from Sections 27(a)(1) and 27(h)(1) of the 1940 Act. Issuers and their affiliates may only
rely on Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(13)(i) or 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(i) if they meet the respective Rule's alternative limitations
on sales load as defined in Rule 6e&hyph;2(c)(4) or Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4). Applicants state that, depending upon
the load structure of a particular Contract, these alternative limitations may not be met if the deduction for the
increase in an issuer's federal tax burden is included in sales load. Although a deduction for an insurance company's
increased federal tax burden does not fall squarely within any of the specified charges or adjustments which are excluded
from the definition of ``sales load'' in Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4), Applicants state that they
have found no public policy reason for including them in ``sales load.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The public policy that underlies Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(13)(i) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(i), like that which underlies
Sections 27(a)(1) and 27(h)(1) of the 1940 Act, is to prevent excessive sales loads from being charged in connection
with the sale of periodic payment plan certificates. Applicants submit that the treatment of a federal income tax
charge attributable to premium payments as sales load would not in any way further this legislative purpose because
such a deduction has no relation to the payment of sales commissions or other distribution expenses. Applicants state
that the Commission has concurred with this conclusion by excluding deductions for state premium taxes from the definition
of ``sales load'' in Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicants assert that the source for the definition of ``sales load'' found in the Rules supports this analysis.
Applicants state that the Commission's intent in adopting such provisions was to tailor the general terms of Section
2(a)(35) of the 1940 Act to variable life insurance contracts. Just as the percentage limits of Sections 27(a)(1)
and 27(h)(1) depend on the definition of ``sales load'' in Section 2(a)(35) for their efficacy, the percentage limits
in Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(13)(i) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(i) depend on Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4),
respectively, which do not depart, in principle, from Section 2(a)(35).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Section 2(a)(35) excludes deductions from premiums for ``issue taxes'' from the definition of ``sales load''
under the 1940 Act. Applicants submit that this suggests that it is consistent with the policies of the 1940 Act to exclude
from the definition of ``sales load'' in Rules 6e&hyph;2 and 6e&hyph;3(T) deductions made to pay an insurance company's
costs attributable to its tax obligations. Section 2(a)(35) also excludes administrative expenses or fees that
are ``not properly chargeable to sales or promotional activities.'' Applicants argue that this suggests that the
only deductions intended to fall within the definition of ``sales load'' are those that are properly chargeable to
such activities. Because the proposed deductions will be used to compensate FKLA for its increased federal income
tax burden attributable to the receipt of premiums, and are not properly chargeable to sales or promotional activities,
this language in Section 2(a)(35) is another indication that not treating such deductions as ``sales load'' is consistent
with the policies of the 1940 Act.

10. Applicants assert that the terms of the relief requested with respect to Contracts to be issued through the Separate
Account or through Future Accounts are consistent with the standards enumerated in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. Without
the requested relief, Applicants would have to request and obtain exemptive relief for each Future Contract. Applicants
state that such additional requests for exemptive relief would present no issues under the 1940 Act not already addressed
in this request for exemptive relief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Applicants assert that the requested relief is appropriate in the public interest because it would promote competitiveness
in the variable life insurance market by eliminating the need for Applicants to file redundant exemptive applications,
thereby reducing administrative expenses and maximizing efficient use of resources. The delay and expense involved
in having to seek repeated exemptive relief would impair the ability of Applicants to take advantage fully of business
opportunities as those opportunities arise. Additionally, Applicants state that the requested relief is consistent
with the purposes of the 1940 Act and the protection of investors for the same reasons. If Applicants were required
to seek exemptive relief repeatedly with respect to the same issues addressed in this application, investors would
not receive any benefit or additional protection thereby and might be disadvantaged as a result of increased overhead
expenses for Applicants.

Conclusion

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants submit that, for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Section
27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e&hyph;2(c)(4)(v) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4)(v) thereunder, to permit the deduction
of up to 1.25% of premium payments under the Contracts meet the standards in Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. In this regard,
Applicants assert that granting the relief requested in the application would be appropriate in the public interest
and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the
1940 Act.

Applicants' Representations

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Providentmutual, a stock life insurance company incorporated under the name of Washington Square Life Insurance
Company in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1958 and redomiciled as a Delaware insurance company in December 1992,
is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company of Philadelphia (``Provident Mutual Life''),
a mutual insurance company chartered by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1865. Providentmutual currently is
licensed to transact life insurance business in 48 states and the District of Columbia.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. For purposes of the 1940 Act, Providentmutual is depositor and sponsor of the Account (and would be the depositor
and sponsor of any future accounts) as those terms have been interpreted by the Commission with respect to variable
life insurance company separate accounts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Providentmutual currently is developing a new flexible premium adjustable variable life insurance contract
(the ``Contract'') which includes the ``tax burden charge'' identified above and as explained more fully below.
Providentmutual also anticipates that it would include such a charge in future flexible premium variable life insurance
contracts (``future contracts'') that it may develop.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The Contract and any future contracts issued by Providentmutual may be supported by the Account or any future accounts.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
5. The Account was established by Providentmutual as a separate investment account under Delaware law on June 30,
1994, as a funding vehicle for variable life insurance contracts. The Account will be registered under the 1940 Act
as a unit investment trust. The Account will be divided into subaccounts, each of which will invest exclusively in
the shares of a designated investment portfolio of a specified open-end management investment company registered
under the 1940 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Under Delaware law, amounts allocated to the Account are owned by Providentmutual. To the extent provided under
the Contract, however, that portion of the assets of the Account equal to the reserves and other Contract liabilities
pertaining to the Account shall not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business Providentmutual
may conduct. The income, gains and losses, realized and unrealized, from the assets allocated to the Account are credited
to or charged against the Account without regard to other income, gains or losses of Providentmutual. The Account
is, and any future account will be, a ``separate account,'' as defined by Rule 0&hyph;1(e) under the 1940 Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. PML is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company of Philadelphia. PML acts
as principal underwriter, as defined in the 1940 Act, of the variable life insurance contracts supported by the Account.
PML is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is a member of the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Inc. Applications for the Contracts and future contracts will be solicited by registered
representatives of PML, or other broker-dealers having selling agreements will PML, who are licensed by applicable
state insurance authorities to sell flexible premium variable life insurance contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ``Code'')
by, among other things, enacting Section 848 thereof. Section 848 changed the federal income taxation of life insurance
companies by requiring them to capitalize and amortize over a period of ten years part of their general expenses for
the current year. Under prior law, these expenses were deductible in full from the current year's gross income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. The amount of expenses that must be capitalized and amortized under Section 848 is generally determined with reference
to premiums for certain categories of life insurance and other contracts (``specified contracts''). Thus, for each
specified contract, an amount of expenses must be capitalized and amortized equal to a percentage of the current year's
net premiums (i.e., gross premiums minus return premiums and reinsurance premiums) for that contract. The percentage
varies, depending on the type of specified contract in question, according to a schedule set forth in Section 848(c)(1).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Although framed in terms of requiring a portion of a life insurance company's general expenses to be capitalized
and amortized, Section 848 in effect accelerates the realization of income from specified contracts for federal
income tax purposes and, therefore, the payment of taxes on the income generated by those contracts. When the time
value of money is taken into account, this has the economic consequence of increasing the tax burden borne by the insurance
company that is attributable to such contracts. Because the amount of general deductions that must be capitalized
and amortized is measured by premiums paid for specified contracts, an increased tax burden results from the receipt
of those premiums. In this respect, the impact of Section 848 can be compared with that of a state premium tax. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. The Contract and any future contracts to which the ``tax burden charge'' will be applied are among the specified
contracts. They fall into the category of life insurance contracts for which the percentage of net premiums that determines
the amount of otherwise currently deductible general expenses to be capitalized and amortized with respect to such
contracts is 7.7 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
12. The increased tax burden resulting from the applicability of Section 848 to every $10,000 of net premiums received
may be quantified as follows. In the year when the premiums are received, Providentmutual's general deductions are
reduced by $731.50_i.e., an amount equal to (a) 7.7 percent of $10,000, or $770, minus (b) one-half year's portion
of the ten-year amortization, or $38.50. Using a 35 percent corporate tax rate, this works out to an increase in tax
for the current year of $256.03. This reduction will be partially offset by increased deductions that will be allowed
during the next ten years as a result of amortizing the remainder of the $770_$77 in each of the following nine years,
and $38.50 in the tenth year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
13. To the extent and capital must be used by Providentmutual to satisfy its increased federal tax burden under Section
848 resulting from the receipt of premiums, such profits are not available to Providentmutual for investment. Accordingly
Providentmutual submits that its targeted rate of return is appropriate for use in this present value calculation.
Because it seeks an after tax rate of return of 9.3 percent on its invested capital
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 Providentmutual submits that a discount rate of at least 9.3 percent is appropriate for use in calculating the present
value of its future tax deductions resulting from the amortization described above.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
In determining its cost of capital, Providentmutual considered a number of factors. Providentmutual first projected
its future growth rate based on sales projects, current interest rates, the inflation rate, and the amount of capital
that it can provide to support such growth. Providentmutual then used the anticipated growth rate and other factors
(such as market interest rates, Providentmutual's anticipated long-term growth rate, the risk level for this type
of business that is acceptable to Providentmutual, inflation and available information about the rates of return
obtained by other insurance companies) to set a rate of return on capital that equals or exceeds this rate of growth.
(Of these other factors, market interest rates, the acceptable risk level and the inflation rate receive significantly
more weight than information about the rates of return obtained by other insurance companies.) Providentmutual
represents that these are appropriate factors for Providentmutual to consider in determining its cost of capital.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Providentmutual also took into account the ratio of surplus to assets that it seeks to maintain. Providentmutual
represents that maintaining the ratio of surplus to assets is critical to maintaining a competitive rating from various
rating agencies and to offering competitively priced products (i.e., sufficient dividends on outstanding contracts
and competitive pricing on newly offered contracts). Consequently, Providentmutual asserts that its surplus must
grow at least at the same rate as its assets.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
14. Using a corporate tax rate of 35 percent, and assuming a discount rate of 9.3 percent, the present value of the tax
effect of the increased deductions allowable in the following ten years comes to $165.16. Because this amount partially
offsets the increased tax burden, applying Section 848 to the specified contracts imposes an increased tax burden
on Providentmutual equal to a present value of $90.87 (i.e., $256.03 minus $165.16) for each $10,000 of net premiums.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
15. Because state premium taxes are deductible when computing federal income taxes, Providentmutual does not incur
incremental income tax when it passes on state premium taxes to contract owners. In contrast, federal income taxes
are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
not 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
tax-deductible when computing Providentmutual's federal income taxes. Therefore, to offset fully the impact of
Section 848, Providentmutual must impose an additional charge that would make it whole not only for the $90.87 additional
tax burden attributable to Section 848, but also for the tax on the additional $90.87 itself. This additional charge
can be computed by dividing $90.87 by the complement of the 35 percent federal corporate income taxe rate (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
65 percent), resulting in an additional charge of $139.80 for each $10,000 of net premiums, or 1.40 percent of net premiums.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
16. Tax deductions are of value to Providentmutual only to the extent that it has sufficient gross income to fully utilize
the deductions. Based on its prior experience, Providentmutual submits that it can reasonably expect to have sufficient
taxable income in future years to utilize all deferred acquisition cost deductions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
17. Providentmutual submits that a charge of 1.25 percent of premium payments would reimburse it for the impact of
Section 848 (as currently written) on its federal tax liabilities. Providentmutual represents that a 1.25 percent
charge is reasonably related to its increased tax burden under Section 848, taking into account the benefit to Providentmutual
of the amortization permitted by Section 848, and the use by Providentmutual of a 9.3 percent discount rate in computing
the future deductions resulting from such amortization, such rate being the equivalent of Providentmutual's cost
of capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
18. Providentmutual asserts that it would have to increase the 1.25 percent charge if future changes in, or interpretations
of, Section 848 or any successor provision result in a further increased tax burden resulting from the receipt of premiums.
Such an increase could result from a change in the corporate tax rate, a change in the 7.7 percent figure, or a change
in the amortization period. The Contract and any future contracts issued by Providentmutual will reserve the right
to increase or decrease the 1.25 percent charge in response to future changes in, or interpretations of, Section 848
or any successor provision that increase or decrease Providentmutual's tax burden.

Applicant's Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act provides, in relevant part, that the Commission, by order upon application, may exempt
any person, security or transaction (or any class or classes of persons, securities or transactions) from provisions
of the 1940 Act or any rules thereunder, if and to the extent that the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public
interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions
of the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants request an order of the Commission pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, exempting them from the provisions
of Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act and Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4)(v) thereunder to the extent necessary to permit Applicants
to deduct from premium payments received in connection with the Contracts and any future contracts an amount that
is reasonable in relation to Providentmutual's increased federal tax burden created by its receipt of such premium
payments. The deduction would not be treated as sales load.

A. Relief From Provisions of Section 27(c)(2) and Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4)(v)
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 2(a)(35) of the 1940 Act defines ``sales load'' as the difference between the price of a security offered
to the public and that portion of the proceeds from its sale which is received and invested or held for investment by
the issuer (or in the case of a unit investment trust, by the depositor or trustee), less any portion of such difference
deducted for trustees's or custodian's fees, insurance premiums, issue taxes, or administrative expenses or fees
which are not properly chargeable to sales or promotional activities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Section 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibits a registered investment company or a depositor or underwriter for such
company from making any deduction from purchase payments made under periodic payment plan certificates other than
a deduction for sales load. Sections 27(a) (1) and 27(h)(1) of the 1940 Act, in effect, limit sales loads on periodic
payment plan certificates to 9 percent of total payments.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Paragraph (a) of Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) requires that a separate account (such as the Account or any future accounts)
that issues flexible premium variable life insurance contracts, its principal underwriter and its depositor, comply
with all provisions of the 1940 Act and rules thereunder applicable to a registered investment company issuing periodic
payment plan certificates.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Paragraph (b) of Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) provides numerous limited conditional exemptions from most such provisions
and rules in connection with the offer, sale and administration of flexible premium variable life insurance contracts.
For example, among other things, Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(iii)(E) provides relief from Section 27(c)(2) of the
1940 Act to the extent necessary to permit the deduction of certain charges other than sales load, including ``[t]he
deduction of premium or other taxes imposed by any state or other governmental entity.'' Applicants request the relief
from Section 27(c)(2) sought in this application only to preclude the possibility that a charge related to the increased
burden resulting from Section 848 of the Code is not covered by the exemption provided by Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(iii)(E).
Applicants submit that the public policy reasons underlying Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(iii)(E) provide support
for the exemption from Section 27(c)(2) requested herein. In this regard, Applicants note that the Commission previously
has issued orders granting substantially similar relief to that requested by Applicants, including an order to Providentmutual's
corporate parent under nearly identical circumstances.

5. Applicants represent that the requested exemption is necessary if they are to rely on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(i)
under the 1940 Act, which provides critical exemptions from Sections 27(a)(1) and 27(h)(1) thereof. Applicants
note that issuers and their affiliates may rely on Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(13)(i) only if they meet its alternative
limits that apply to ``sales load,'' as defined in rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4). Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4) defines ``sales
load'' during a contract period as the excess of any payments made during that period over certain specified charges
and adjustments, including a deduction for and approximately equal to state premium taxes. Applicants represent
that a ``tax burden charge'' such as the one Providentmutual proposes to deduct does not fall squarely into any of the
itemized categories of charges or adjustments. Applicants note that a literal reading of Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4)
arguably does not exclude such a ``tax burden charge'' from sales load.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Applicants maintain, however, that there is no public policy reason why a ``tax burden charge'' designed to cover
the expense of federal taxes should be treated as sales load or otherwise be subject to the sales load limits of Rule
6e&hyph;3(T). Applicants also assert that nothing in the administrative history of Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) (or, for that
matter, in the administrative history of Rule 6e&hyph;2, its predecessor rule) suggests that the Commission intended
to treat tax charges as sales load.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicants assert that the public policy that underlies Rule 6e&hyph;3T(b)(13)(i), like that which underlies
Sections 27(a)(1) and 27(h)(1), is to prevent excessive sales loads from being charged in connection with the sale
of periodic payment plan certificates. Applicants submit that the treatment of a ``tax burden charge'' attributable
to the receipt of purchase payments as sales load would in no way further this legislative purpose because such a deduction
has no relation to the payment of sales commissions or other distribution expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. Applicants assert that the genesis of Rule 6e&hyph;3T(c)(4) supports this analysis. in this regard, Applicants
note that Section 2(a)(35) of the 1940 Act provides a scale against which the percent limits of Sections 27(a)(1) and
27(h)(1) thereof may be measured. Applicants submit that the Commission's intent in adopting Rule 6e&hyph;3T(c)(4)
was to tailor the general terms of Section 2(a)(35) to flexible premium variable life insurance contracts in order,
among other things, to facilitate verification by the Commission of compliance with the sales load limits set forth
in Rule 6e&hyph;3T(b)(13)(i). Applicants submit that Rule 6e&hyph;3T(c)(4) does not depart, in principal, from
Section 2(a)(35), and that both Section 2(a)(35) and Rule 6e&hyph;3T(c)(4) define ``sales load'' derivatively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. Applicants further assert that Section 2(a)(35) clearly excludes from the definition of ``sales load'' under
the 1940 Act deductions from purchase payments for ``issue taxes.'' Applicants submit that the exclusion of charges
for expenses attributable to federal taxes from sales load (as defined in Section 2(a)(35)) is consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act. By extension, Applicants
submit, it is equally consistent to exclude such charges, including the ``tax burden charge'' described above, from
the definition of ``sales load'' in Rule 6e&hyph;3T(c)(4).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10. Applicants submit that the reference in Section 2(a)(35) to administrative expenses or fees that are ``not properly
chargeable to sales or promotional activities'' suggests that the only charges or deductions intended to fall within
the definition of ``sales load'' are those that 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
are
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 properly chargeable to such activities. Because the proposed ``tax burden charge'' will be used to pay costs attributable
to Providentmutual's federal tax liabilities, and such costs are not properly chargeable to sales or promotional
activities, Applicants assert that the language of Section 2(a)(35) is another indication that not treating the
proposed ``tax burden charge'' as sales load is consistent with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions
of the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11. Applicants state that the specification of only state premium taxes in Rule 6e&hyph;3T(c)(4)(v) probably is
an historical accident, related to the fact that the Section 848 tax burden attributable to the receipt of premiums
did not exist when Rule 6e&hyph;3T was initially adopted in 1984 and amended in 1987. Applicants note that nothing
in the administrative history of Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) suggests that the exclusion from the definition of ``sales load''
of deductions for tax liabilities attributable to the amount of premium payments received was tried to the type of
government entity imposing such taxes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
12. For these reasons, Applicants assert that deducting a charge from variable life insurance contract premium payments
for an insurer's tax burdens attributable to its receipt of such payments and excluding that charge from sales load
is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act. Applicants submit that this is because such a charge is for a legitimate
expense of the insurer and is not designed to cover sales and distribution expenses. Applicants note that, in adopting
Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) and its analog, Rule 63&hyph;2, which applies to schedule premium variable life insurance contracts,
the Commission considered similar deductions for tax burdens in respect of premium taxes. In each case, the Commission
permitted deductions for such taxes to be made and to be treated as other than sales load. Applicants submit that the
propriety of a charge for an insurer's tax burden attributable to premium payments received is the same whether such
burden arises under state or federal law.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Request for ``Class Relief''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants note that the relief sought herein applies to existing Accounts as well as to future accounts that Providentmutual
may establish to support flexible premium variable life insurance contracts. Such future accounts may be established
as additional investment options under previously issued contracts. Such future accounts may be established as
additional investment options under previously issued contracts that have a ``tax burden charge'' or as investment
options for new contracts that may have a ``tax burden charge.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Applicants submit that because the terms of any exemption sought for the future accounts to permit the deduction
of a ``tax burden charge'' would be substantially identical to those in this application, any additional requests
for exemptive relief for the future accounts would present no issues under the 1940 Act that have not already been addressed
in this application. Applicants note, however, that unless the ``class relief'' requested herein is granted, Providentmutual
would have to request and obtain exemptive relief for each future account to the extent required. For the reasons set
forth below, Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and are consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants submit that the requested ``class relief'' would promote competitiveness in the variable life insurance
market by eliminating the need for Providentmutual to file redundant exemptive applications, thereby reducing
its administrative expenses and maximizing the efficient use of its resources. Applicants submit that the delay
and expense involved in having repeatedly to seek the same exemptions would impair Providentmutual's ability to
effectively take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants further submit that owners of Contracts and future contracts would receive no benefit or additional
protection if Providentmutual were required repeatedly to seek Commission orders with respect to the same issues
addressed in this application; indeed, they might be disadvantaged as a result of Providentmutual's increased overhead
expenses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conditions for Relief
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicants agree to comply with the following conditions for relief:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Providentmutual will monitor the reasonableness of the 1.25 percent charge.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. The registration statement for the Contract and for any future contracts under which the 1.25 percent charge is
deducted will include: (i) disclosure of the charge; (ii) disclosure explaining the purpose of the charge; and (iii)
a statement that the charge is reasonable in relation to Providentmutual's increased tax burden as a result of applying
Section 848 of the Code.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Providentmutual also will include an exhibit to the registration statement for the Contract and for any other variable
life insurance contract under which the 1.25 percent charge is deducted an actuarial opinion as to: (i) the reasonableness
of the charge in relation to Providentmutual's increased tax burden as a result of Section 848 of the Code; (ii) the
reasonableness of the after tax rate of return used in calculating the charge; and (iii) the appropriateness of the
factors taken into account by Providentmutual in determining the after tax rate of return.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants submit that for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested exemptions from Section 27(c)(2)
of the 1940 Act and Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(c)(4)(v) thereunder to permit the deduction of 1.25 percent of premium payments
under the Contracts and any future contracts meet the standards of Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. In this regard, Applicants
assert that granting the requested relief would be appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act.

Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby
given that on December 7, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange proposes to trade options on The Amex Airline Index (``Index''), a new stock index developed by the Amex
based on airline industry stocks (or ADRs thereon) which are traded on the Amex, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''),
or are national market system (``Nasdaq/NMS'') securities traded through Nasdaq. In addition, the Amex proposes
to amend Rule 901C, Commentary .01 to reflect that 90% of the Index's numerical index value will be accounted for by
stocks that meet the current criteria and guidelines set forth in Rule 915. The text of the proposed rule change is available
at the Office of the Secretary, the Amex, and at the Commission.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Amex has developed a new industry-specific index called The Amex Airline Index, based entirely on shares of widely-held
airline industry stocks or American Depository Receipts (``ADRs'') which are exchange listed or are Nasdaq/NMS
securities.

 It is intended that the Amex list standardized option contracts on the newly developed Index. The Exchange is filing
this proposal pursuant to Rule 901C, Commentary .02, which provides for the commencement of trading of options on
the Index thirty days after the filing date, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 30 days after December 7, 1994. The Exchange represents that the proposal satisfies all the criteria set forth in Commentary
.02 to Rule 901C and the Commission's order approving that rule as outlined below.

Eligibility Standards for Index Components
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to Commentary .02 to Amex Rule 901C, the Amex represents that all of the component securities of the Index
are listed on the NYSE or are Nasdaq/NMS securities, each of the component securities has a minimum market capitalization
of at least $75 million,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
3
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and each has a monthly trading volume of at least one million shares per month over each of the six months preceding the
filing of this proposal. In addition, all of the component securities in the Index have standardized options traded
on them and thus have met the initial eligibility criteria for standardized options trading set forth in Amex Rule
915. One component (USAir Group), however, has traded below $5 during two of the last six months. While it is not known
at this point whether options on USAir Group will eventually be delisted, the Index would still satisfy the criteria
set forth in Commentary .02 to Rule 901C because as a result of each quarterly rebalancing, at least 90% of the value
of the Index and at least 80% of the total number of components will meet the standards set forth in Rule 915.

As a result of the ``equal dollar-weighting'' calculation methodology,
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 no individual component stock in the Index represents more than 25% of the weight of the Index following each quarterly
rebalancing. Additionally, the top five highest weighted stocks in the Index do not constitute more than 60% of the
weight of the Index. Finally, because the sole ADR component of the Index (British Airways PLC) has standardized options
trading on it, the Index also satisfies the criteria that no more than 20% of the weight of the Index can be composed of
non-options eligible foreign securities (including ADRs).

Maintenance of the Index
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange will maintain the Index so that (1) the total number of component securities will not increase or decrease
by more than 331/3% from the number of components in the proposed Index (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 10) and in no event will the Index have less than nine components; (2) component stocks constituting the top 90% of
the Index by weight, must have a minimum market capitalization of $75 million and the component stocks constituting
the bottom 10% of the Index, by weight, must have a minimum market capitalization of $50 million; (3) the monthly trading
volume of each component security shall be at least 500,000 shares, provided, however, that components accounting
in aggregate for no more than 10% of the Index, by weight, shall have a monthly trading volume of at least 400,000 shares;
and (4) the Index shall satisfy the criteria that no single component will represent more than 25% of the weight of the
Index and that the five highest weighted component shall represent no more than 60% of the weight of the Index, as of
each quarterly rebalancing.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Exchange shall not open for trading any additional option series should the Index fail to satisfy any of the maintenance
criteria set forth above unless such failure is determined by the Exchange not to be significant and the Commission
concurs in that determination.

Index Calculation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Index is calculated using an ``equal dollar-weighting'' methodology designed to ensure that each of the component
securities is represented in an approximately ``equal'' dollar amount in the Index. The Exchange believes that this
method of calculation is important since even among the largest companies in the airline industry there is great disparity
in market value. For example, although the stocks included in the Index represent many of the most highly capitalized
companies in the airline industry, the five most highly capitalized companies in the airline industry currently
represent approximately 80% of the aggregate market value of the Index. It has been the Exchange's experience that
options on market value weighted indexes dominated by relatively few component stocks are less useful to investors
because the index will tend to represent those few components and not the broader target sector that the index is designed
to represent.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The following is a description of how the equal dollar-weighting calculation method works. As of the market close
on October 21, 1994, a portfolio of airline securities was established representing an investment of $10,000 in the
stock (or ADR) (rounded to the nearest whole share) of each of the companies in the Index. The value of the Index equals
the current market value (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 based on U.S. primary market prices) of the sum of the assigned number of shares of each of the securities in the Index
portfolio divided by the Index divisor. The Index divisor was initially determined to yield the benchmark value of
200.00 at the close of trading on October 21, 1994. Each quarter thereafter, following the close of trading on the third
Friday of January, April, July, and October, the Index portfolio will be adjusted by changing the number of whole shares
of each component security so that each company is again represented in ``equal'' dollar amounts. The Exchange has
chosen to rebalance following the close of trading on the quarterly expiration cycle because it allows an option contract
to be held for up to three months without a change in the Index portfolio while at the same time, maintaining the equal
dollar-weighting feature of the Index. If necessary, a divisor adjustment is made at the rebalancing to ensure continuity
of the Index's value. The newly adjusted portfolio becomes the basis for the Index's value on the first trading day
following the quarterly adjustment.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, the number of shares of each component security in the Index portfolio remains fixed between quarterly
reviews except in the event of certain types of corporate actions such as the payment of a dividend other than an ordinary
cash dividend, a stock distribution, stock split, reverse stock split, rights offering, distribution, reorganization,
recapitalization, or similar event with respect to the component securities. In a merger or consolidation of an issuer
of a component security, if the stock or ADR remains in the Index, the number of shares of that security in the portfolio
may be adjusted, to the nearest whole share, to maintain the component's relative weight in the Index at the level immediately
prior to the corporate action. In the event of a stock or ADR replacement, the average dollar value of the remaining
portfolio components will be calculated and that amount invested in the security of the new component, to the nearest
whole share. In all cases, the divisor will be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure Index continuity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex will calculate and maintain the Index, and pursuant to Exchange Rule 901C(b) may at any time or from time to
time substitute securities, or adjust the number of securities included in the Index based on changing conditions
in the airline industry. In the event, however, that the Exchange determines to increase the number of Index components
to greater than thirteen or to reduce the number of components to fewer than nine, the Exchange will submit a 19b&hyph;4
filing to the Commission. In selecting securities to be included in the Index, the Exchange will be guided by a number
of factors including market value of outstanding shares, trading activity, and adherence to Rule 901C, Commentary
.02. Similar to other stock index values published by the Exchange, the value of the Index will be calculated continuously
and disseminated every 15 seconds over the Consolidated Tape Association's Network B.

Expiration and Settlement

The proposed options on the Index are European-style,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 and cash-settled. The Exchange's standard option trading hours (9:30 a.m. to 4:10 p.m. Eastern Standard Time) will
apply to Index options. The options on the Index will expire on the Saturday following the third Friday of the expiration
month (``Expiration Friday''). The last trading day in an Index option series will normally be the second to last business
day preceding the Saturday following Expiration Friday (normally a Thursday). Trading in expiring Index options
will cease at the close of trading on the last trading day.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Exchange plans to list Index options series with expirations in the three near-term calendar months and in the
two additional calendar months in the January cycle. In addition, longer term option series having up to thirty-six
months to expiration may be traded. In lieu of such long-term options based on the full-value of the Index, the Exchange
may instead list long-term, reduced-value put and call options based on one tenth (1/10th) of the Index's full value.
In either event, the interval between expiration months for either a full-value of reduced-value long-term Index
option will not be less than six months. The trading of any long-term Index options would be subject to the same rules
which govern the trading of all the Exchange's index options, including sales practice rules, margin requirements,
and floor trading procedures. Position limits on reduced-value long-term Index options will be equivalent to the
position limits for regular (full-value) Index options and would be aggregated with such options. For example, if
the position limit for the full-value options on the Index is 10,500 contracts on the same side of the market, then the
position limit for the reduced-value options will be 105,000 contracts on the same side of the market and positions
in reduced-value Index options will be aggregated with positions in full-value Index options.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The exercise settlement value for all of the expiring Index options will be calculated based upon the primary exchange
regular way opening sale prices for the component securities. In the case of Nasdaq/NMS securities, the first reported
sale price will be used. If any component security does not open for trading on its primary market on the last day before
expiration, then the prior day's last sale price will be used in the exercise settlement value calculation.

Exchange Rules Applicable to Stock Index Options
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Amex Rules 900C through 980C will apply to the trading of option contracts based on the Index. These rules cover issues
such as surveillance, exercise prices, and position limits. Surveillance procedures currently used to monitor
trading in each of the Exchange's other index options will also be used to monitor trading in options on the Index. The
Index is deemed to be a Stock Index Option under Rule 901C(a) and a Stock Index Industry Group under Rule 900C(b)(1).
With respect to Rule 903C(b), the Exchange proposes to list near-the-money (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
strike prices within ten points above or below the current Index value) option series on the Index at 21/2 intervals
only when the value of the Index is below 200 points. In addition, the Exchange expects that the review required by Rule
904C(c) will result in a position limit of 10,500 contracts with respect to options on this Index.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Amex represents that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers
the objectives of Section 6(b)(5)
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 in particular in that it will permit trading in options based on the Amex Airline Index pursuant to rules designed to
prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities, and to remove impediments
to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system.

I. Description
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed rule change amends MSRB Rule G&hyph;34 to require generally that dealers acquiring new issue municipal
securities apply for depository eligibility. This amendment is designed to facilitate the movement of municipal
securities to a three business day (``T+3'') settlement time frame.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Because interdealer and institutional customer transactions are settled on a delivery vs. payment or receipt vs.
payment (``DVP/RVP'') basis, it is critical that the delivery of securities be made in a timely manner on the settlement
date. The physical delivery of securities certificates, however, is relatively time-consuming and inefficient
as compared to book-entry delivery through a securities depository. A shortened settlement cycle will provide dealers,
institutional customers, and their clearing agents with less time to deal with the processing requirements and inevitable
problems that arise in connection with transportation, delivery, and acceptance of physical securities certificates.

On October 6, 1993, the Commission adopted Rule 15c6&hyph;1 under the Act which establishes three business days after
the trade date (``T+3'') instead of five business days (``T+5'') as the standard settlement timeframe for most broker-dealer
transactions. The rule becomes effective June 7, 1995. Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 33023 (October 6, 1993),
58 FR 52891 and 34952 (November 9, 1994), 59 FR 59137. Although municipal securities were not included within the scope
of Rule 15c6&hyph;1, the Commission did request that MSRB provide a plan for implementing T+3 settlement in the municipal
securities market. In response, MSRB submitted to the Commission its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
Report of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board on T+3 Settlement for the Municipal Securities Market (March
17, 1994) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
(``T+3 Report''). The T+3 Report detailed changes in operational practices and regulatory actions that will be needed
in the municipal securities market in a T+3 environment. The T+3 Report discussed the need to increase the number of
securities made depository eligible in order to minimize the use of physical securities certificates to settle interdealer
and institutional customer transactions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
MSRB Rules G&hyph;12(f)(ii) and G&hyph;15(d)(iii) require essentially all interdealer and institutional customer
transactions be settled by book-entry when the securities involved in the transactions are listed as eligible for
deposit in a depository. The proposed rule change facilitates book-entry settlement of transactions in municipal
securities by requiring, with limited exceptions, that dealers that acquire new issue municipal securities apply
for depository eligibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed rule change, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers are required to apply for depository
eligibility within one business day of the date of sale of a new issue municipal security.
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 The proposed rule change exempts (1) issues not meeting the eligibility criteria of all depositories that accept
municipal securities for deposit and (2) issues maturing in sixty days or less. The proposed rule change also provides
an exemption until July 1, 1996, for issues under $1 million in par value.

II. Comments
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In March 1994, MSRB requested comment on a draft of the amendment to Rule G&hyph;34 (``Draft Amendment''). The Draft
Amendment included exemptions for issues not meeting the criteria set by depositories for eligibility and for new
issues under $1 million in par value. MSRB received eleven comment letters in response to the draft amendments.
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 The comments generally supported the MSRB's proposal. Five commenters felt that the proposed rule change could facilitate
T+3 settlement.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Two commenters noted that settlement through a depository was more efficient and provided greater cost savings than
settlement with physical certificates.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Some commenters, however, suggested modifications to the draft amendments. In response to these comments, the MSRB
amended their proposal prior to filing the proposed rule change with the Commission.

The MSRB amended the proposed rule to require that the application to a depository be made within one business day of
the date of sale of the issue instead of ten days prior to closing. The MSRB also added the exemption for issues maturing

A. Exemption Until July 1, 1996, for Issues Under $1 Million in Par Value
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Draft Amendment included exemptive language for issues under $1 million in par value.
<FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>
 Nine commenters urged the MSRB to include issues under $1 million in par value within the scope of the rule with most
citing the need for increased settlement efficiencies offered by book-entry when T+3 becomes effective.
<FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>
 Two commenters noted that ultimately all issues should be included within the scope of the rule but suggested a temporary
exemption for small issues because of their belief that some underwriters of small issues may need time to adjust their
procedures for book-entry distribution.
<FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>
 Only the Summers letter stated that a permanent exemption for small issues should be included. In response to these
comments, the MSRB amended its proposal prior to filing with the Commission to include issues under $1 million in par
value but to provide a temporary exemption for such issues until July 1, 1996.

B. Other Suggested Exemptions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Summers letter suggested exempting municipal leases municipal notes, and municipal bonds sold to nondepository
participants. The MSRB rejected this suggestion, stating that it was not aware of any reason that these types of securities
should be treated differently than other municipal securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Discussion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder and particularly with the requirements of Section 15B(b)(2)(C).
<FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>
 Section 15B(b)(2)(C) requires that the rules of the MSRB be designed to foster cooperation and coordination with
persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities. The
proposed rule change meets this requirement by creating a more efficient, safe, and cohesive environment for the
transfer of municipal securities.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By requiring dealers acquiring new issue municipal securities to apply for depository eligibility, the proposal
will help to ensure that the great majority of new issue municipal securities are made depository eligible. As a result,
the number of interdealer and institutional customer transactions that must be settled by book-entry under MSRB
Rules G&hyph;12(f)(ii) and G&hyph;15(d)(iii) should increase greatly. By increasing the number of book-entry
settlements and by limiting the number of physical deliveries that occur, the rule will enhance the efficiency of
the clearance and settlement of municipal securities. As a consequence, a safer environment in which to facilitate
transactions in municipal securities will exist. The proposed rule change also facilitates the conversion to T+3
settlement of municipal securities and thus promotes cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating,
clearing, and settling municipal securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission believes that the limited exemption for issues under $1 million in par value adequately addresses
the concerns of the commenters. The PSA noted that almost 20% of the new issues in 1992 would have been eligible for the
small issue exemption. The Commission believes that it is important that the vast majority of securities be made depository
eligible. There are concerns, however, that underwriters of smaller issues may not be prepared for book-entry distribution.
The Commission believes that the temporary exemption will give underwriters of smaller issues an opportunity to
adapt to book-entry distribution while establishing a definite date by which smaller issues must be made depository
eligible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission also agrees with the MSRB's determination not to exempt municipal leases, municipal notes, and municipal
bonds sold to nondepository participants. The Commission believes that every effort should be made to make as many
types of municipal securities depository eligible as practicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
IV. Conclusion
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Act
and particularly with Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is therefore ordered, pursaunt to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;13)
be, and hereby is, approved and will become effective February 7, 1995.

In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose
of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text
of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has
prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.

A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Purpose
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The purpose of the proposed rule change is to provide for an enhancement to PACE by providing Phlx specialists the opportunity
to effect price improvement for market orders in securities sent through PACE when the spread between the PACE Quote,
which reflects the consolidated national best bid and offer, exceeds 1/8 point in any PACE eligible security. The
proposed rule change provides for an automatic stop of such orders and a fifteen second execution delay, allowing
a Phlx specialist to manually provide for price improvement equal to or better than the stock price.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Specifically, all round-lot market orders of up to 500 shares and all combined round-lot and odd-lot orders of up to
599 shares will be stopped at the PACE Quote at the time of entry into PACE (stopped at the best bid for sell orders; at
the best ask for buy orders) and shall be subject to a delay of up to fifteen seconds from being executed in order to provide
an opportunity for price improvement by the Phlx specialist. If a particular market order is not executed within fifteen
seconds, the order will be automatically executed by the system at the stop price. If the PACE Quote at the time of order
entry reflects a spread between the best bid and offer of 1/8 point, PACE market orders shall be system executed immediately.

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
Accordingly to the Phlx, the proposed rule change does not apply to limit orders, including marketable limit orders,
because such orders are executed manually and, therefore, already have an opportunity for price improvement. Telephone
conversation between William W. Uchimoto, Vice President and General Counsel, Phlx, and Glen Barrentine, Senior
Counsel, SEC, on December 9, 1994.

The Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 in general and Section 6(b)(5) in particular in that it is designed to foster cooperation and coordination
with persons engaged in facilitating transactions in securities and to protect investors and the public interest.
Additionally, the proposed system enhancement and rule change are consistent with the mandate of Section 11A(a)(1)(C)(iv)
of the Act respecting ``[t]he practicability of brokers executing investors' orders in the best market.''

The Department is renewing the Charter of the Secretary of State's Advisory Committee on Private International Law
for two years. The Committee advises the Department on matters concerning the harmonization of private law at the
international level. Private law harmonization is normally achieved by preparation of conventions, model national
laws, legal guides and other materials. This work is undertaken by organizations such as the United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), the Hague Conference on Private International Law, the International Institute
for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT), the Specialized Conference on Private International Law of the Organization
of American States (OAS), the International Chamber of Commerce and others. The Committee reviews projects under
way by the above-referenced organizations or others that may be involved. When appropriate, specialized Study Groups
of the Committee are formed to provide technical advice on particular topics. The Under Secretary for Management
has determined that continuation of the Committee is necessary and in the public interest. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Members of the Committee are appointed by the Legal Adviser, who serves as Chair of the Committee, on the basis of nominations
by national legal organizations. Participation in the work of the Committee and its Study Groups is open to any interested
and qualified person or organization. The Committee follows the procedures of the Federal Advisory Committee Act,
its meetings are open to the public, and notice of each meeting will be provided in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Shipping Coordinating Committee (SCC) will conduct an open meeting at 9:30 AM on Friday, January 6, 1995, in Room
2415, at U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001. The purpose of the
meeting is to finalize preparations for the Thirty-eighth session of the Subcommittee on Ship Design and Equipment
(DE 38) and associated bodies of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) which is scheduled for January 23&hyph;27,
1995, at the IMO Headquarters in London. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the papers received and the draft U.S.
positions for DE 38.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Among other things, the items of particular interest are:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Safety of passenger submersible craft;

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IMO Subcommittees work to develop international agreements, guidelines, and standards for the marine industry.
In most cases, these international agreements, guidelines, and standards form the basis for national standards/regulations
and class society rules. The U.S. Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Working Group supports the U.S. Representative to the
IMO Subcommittee in developing the U.S. position on those issues raised at the IMO Subcommittee meetings. Because
of the impact on domestic regulations through development of these international guidelines, standards, and regulations,
the U.S. SOLAS Working Group serves as an excellent forum for the U.S. maritime industry to express their ideas. All
shipping companies, shipyards, design firms, naval architects, marine engineers, and consultants are encouraged
to send representatives to participate in the development of U.S. positions on those issues affecting your maritime
industry and remain abreast of all activities ongoing within the IMO.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Subcommittee for the Prevention of Marine Pollution (SPMP), a subcommittee of the Shipping Coordinating Committee,
will conduct an open meeting on January 12, 1995, 9:30 AM in Room 2415 of U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second
Street SW., Washington, D.C.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The purpose of this meeting will be to report on the thirty-sixth session of the Marine Environment Protection Committee
(MEPC 36) of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) held from October 31&hyph;November 4, 1994. The Coast
Guard has held similar meetings prior to MEPC sessions. To facilitate public involvement and provide additional
time for the public to review issues addressed at MEPC sessions, the Coast Guard feels an additional public meeting
shortly after an MEPC session is needed. The U.S. delegation to MEPC 36 will report on the activities of the session.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The major items for discussion will be the following:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Prevention of oil pollution. Work progress on the guidelines for implementation of Regulations 13F and 13G to Annex
I of The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78). This includes guidelines
for structural and operational requirements for existing ships, equivalencies for double-hulls for new ships,
and guidelines for enhanced inspections.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Implementation of the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation (OPRC).
An IMO working group addressed topics such as guidelines for the use and application of dispersants and the redraft
of the contingency planning portion of the IMO Oil Pollution Manual.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
c. Follow-up action to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). An MEPC working group
examined IMO's role in implementation of UNCED and discussed the results of a correspondence group on use of the precautionary
principle.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Unwanted aquatic organisms in ballast water. A working group discussed a possible technical annex to MARPOL 73/78
to prevent the introduction of exotic species through discharge of ballast water.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
e. Enforcement of Pollution Conventions. A working group considered refuse recordkeeping amendments to Annex V
of MARPOL 73/78 proposed by the United States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
f. The future work program of the U.S. in preparation for MEPC 37 scheduled for September, 1995.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Policy Statement PS&hyph;109, implemented by Regulation ER&hyph;1322 of the Civil Aeronautics Board and adopted
by the Department, established geographic zones of cargo pricing flexibility within which certain cargo rate tariffs
filed by carriers would be subject to suspension only in extraordinary circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Standard Foreign Rate Level (SFRL) for a particular market is the rate in effect on April 1, 1982, adjusted for the
cost experience of the carriers in the applicable ratemaking entity. The first adjustment was effective April 1,
1983. By Order 94&hyph;10&hyph;8, the Department established the currently effective SFRL adjustments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In establishing the SFRL for the two-month period beginning December 1, 1994, we have projected non-fuel costs based
on the year ended September 30, 1994 data, and have determined fuel prices on the basis of the latest available experienced
monthly fuel cost levels as reported to the Department. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By Order 94&hyph;12&hyph;16 cargo rates may be adjusted by the following adjustment factors over the April 1, 1982

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 41509(e) of Title 49 of the United States Code requires that the Department, as successor to the Civil Aeronautics
Board, establish a Standard Foreign Fare Level (SFFL) by adjusting the SFFL base periodically by percentage changes
in actual operating costs per available seat-mile (ASM). Order 80&hyph;2&hyph;69 established the first interim
SFFL, and Order 94&hyph;10&hyph;7 established the currently effective two-month SFFL applicable through November
30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Autokraft Ltd; Receipt of Application for Renewal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Temporary Exemption From Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Autokraft Limited of Weybridge, Surrey, England, has applied for a renewal of NHTSA Exemption No. 92&hyph;6, exempting
its AC MkIV until January 1, 1995, from compliance with paragraph S4.1.4 of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
No. 208 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Occupant Crash Protection
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The basis of the application is that compliance would cause substantial economic hardship to a manufacturer that
has tried to comply with the standard in good faith. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of receipt of the application is published in accordance with agency regulations on the subject (49 CFR Part
555) and does not represent any judgment of the agency on the merits of the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Autokraft was granted NHTSA Exemption No. 92&hyph;6 on December 21, 1992 (57 FR 60563). The reader is referred to that
notice for further information about the company and its initial compliance efforts. The exemption from S4.1.4 of
Standard No. 208 will expire on January 1, 1995. Because the application for renewal of the exemption was filed ``not
later than 60 days before the termination date'' (in this instance, October 27, 1994), the termination date is stayed
until the Administrator has acted upon the application (49 CFR 555.8(e)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant seeks a further two-year exemption for its AC Mark IV passenger car, of which it has produced 15 in the
year preceding the filing of its application. Although the company had projected sales of 150 units in the United States
in the years 1992&hyph;94, in fact, there have been only seven sales. According to its application, Autokraft ``has
continued the process of researching and developing the installation of a driver and passenger side airbag system''
but ``we have been unable to achieve the fitting of a suitable system mainly due to the chassis design being based upon
a classic 1960's design and not easily adaptable to suit air bag installation.'' The delay is also due to ``the project
having insufficient funds generated by sales and available for completing the development.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Autokraft has concluded that the adaptation of an existing automatic restraint system is the only viable alternative.
Its continuation of compliance efforts has given it ``significant knowledge into the areas of vehicle modification,
computer simulation, design rough road testing and low, medium and high speed crash testing.'' Complicating its
efforts is the need to use a different engine and transmission after October 1, 1995, and the possible effect that this
will have upon compliance. It estimates the cost to achieve conformance would be $550,000, achievable by spreading
these costs during the exemption period. Autokraft reports losses totalling 3,308,243 Pounds Sterling (approximately
$5,624,000 at a rate of $1.70/1) for the years 1992&hyph;93, and projects a further loss for 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The company argues that an exemption would be in the public interest and consistent with the objectives of motor vehicle
safety because it meets all applicable EEC standards, and all U.S. Federal motor vehicle safety standards with the
exception of the automatic restraint requirements of Standard No. 208 (its 3-point driver and passenger restraints
meet the previous requirements). The production of the car makes available to the public ``at a realistic price''
a replica of the original AC Cobra vehicle produced from the original AC Cobra tooling, manufactured during the 1960's
predominantly for the American market. Autokraft is in the process of finalizing a U.S. distribution agreement and
will show the car at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The applicant believes that it will comply with Standard No. 208 six months before January 1, 1997, when the 2-year
extension of its exemption that it has requested would expire. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the application described above. Comments should refer to Docket
No. 92&hyph;50; Notice 3, and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
room 5109, 400 Seventh St. SW, Washington, DC 20590. It is requested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

possible, comments filed after the closing date will also be considered. Notice of final action on the petition will

Noncompliance With Standard No. 108 is Inconsequential to Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
General Motors Corporation (GM) of Warren, Michigan, determined that some of its vehicles failed to comply with 49
CFR 571.108, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 108, ``Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated
Equipment,'' and filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.''
GM also applied to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301 - ``Motor Vehicle
Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice of receipt of the application was published on July 29, 1994, and an opportunity afforded for comment (59 FR
38660). This notice grants the application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Figure 10 of FMVSS No. 108, referenced at S5.1.1.27(a)(3), lists the photometric requirements for center high-mounted
stop lamps (CHMSLs). GM produced two different vehicle populations which do not meet the photometric requirements
of Figure 10. The first population of vehicles, approximately 23,695 Cadillac Deville and Deville Concours produced
between the start of the 1994 model year and November 19, 1993, had their CHMSLs ``framed'' in the rear window by a 27
mm high opening in the blackout paint at the lower edge of the rear window. A vertical shift in the installed position
of the rear window, compounded by build variation, caused the painted frame around the CHMSL on each of these vehicles
to obscure the photometric performance at the 5D line. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second population of vehicles, approximately 65,403 Cadillac Deville and Deville Concours produced between
November 19, 1993, and May 4, 1994, has a narrower painted ``frame'' around the CHMSL in the rear window. The painted
frame width was reduced due to an engineering change by 5 mm to a width of 22 mm. The shift in installed position and build
variation noted above obscured the 5D line on some of these vehicles. Other vehicles within this second population
had the 10U line obscured as a result of build variation. In no case were both the 5D and 10U lines obscured. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
GM supported its application for inconsequential noncompliance as discussed below. GM also submitted diagrams
and tables in support which are available for review in the NHTSA docket. According to GM: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
GM performed a dimensional analysis on a 51-vehicle sample to determine where the paint opening on the rear glass was
in relation to the CHMSL. (Note that no CHMSL could be obscured at both the top and bottom by the paint line.) For those
vehicles with the CHMSL obscured at the bottom of the lamp, the analysis, which approximates a normal distribution,
indicated that 1.5 percent of the entire population of vehicles, or approximately 1,336 vehicles, could experience
sufficient obscuration to render the vehicles out of compliance with FMVSS 108, with a 4.6 mm worst case infringement
at the bottom of the CHMSL. However, a photometric test conducted on a CHMSL with a 4.6 mm mask at the bottom of the lamp
established that for the test points that fell on and below horizontal, i.e., for the points on the H and 5D lines, photometric
output exceeded FMVSS 108 requirements by an average of 75 percent. *&blank;*&blank;* Even on the 5D line, all five
test points were within 20 percent of FMVSS 108, with the worst performance at 5D&hyph;5R, where the tested value was
23.0 candela, or 82 percent of the 25.0 candela requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As for those vehicles with the CHMSL obscured at the top of the lamp, the sample suggests that 15 percent of the second
population described above, or 9,810 vehicles, could be obscured to the point that they would fail to comply with FMVSS
108, with a worst case infringement at the top of the CHMSL of 4.5 mm. However, a photometric test on a CHMSL with a 4.5
mm mask at the top of the lamp demonstrated that while test values on the 10U line fall below required levels, the lamp
provides approximately 75 percent more light output above horizontal (at the 5U and 10U lines combined) than required
by FMVSS 108. (Photometric output of the obscured lamp as a whole approximated 33 percent more than FMVSS 108 requirements.)
*&blank;*&blank;*
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine the extent of the noncompliance for those vehicles obscured at the top of the CHMSL, GM plotted data from
a series of photometric tests of 10U-V (the worst performing test point), with varying degrees of obscuration, against
performance to the FMVSS 108 requirement. The result approximates a linear function of obscuration versus photometric
output, and suggests that subject CHMSLs obscured less than 3.07 mm will fall within 20 percent of the values listed
in FMVSS 108 *&blank;*&blank;*. Applying the distribution determined from GM's 51-vehicle sample to that, approximately
76 percent, or 7,456 of the 9,810 vehicles described above, will provide photometric output within 20 percent of the
FMVSS 108 requirements at 10U. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As acknowledged in NHTSA's notices granting other similar Petitions for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance,
a change in luminous intensity of approximately 25 percent is required before the human eye can detect a difference
between two lamps. (See, e.g., Notice granting Petition by Subaru of America (56 Fed. Reg. 59971); and Notice granting
Petition by Hella, Inc. (55 Fed. Reg. 37601, at 37602).) Given this, the 7,456 vehicles obscured less than 3.07 mm at
the top of the CHMSL, as well as the 1,336 vehicles obscured at the bottom of the lamp, do not compromise motor vehicle
safety since the noncompliance is imperceptible to the naked eye and the overall light at the outer zones (H &amp; 5D;
5U &amp; 10U) exceeds the FMVSS requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the degradation in light output for the 2,354 remaining vehicles would likely be discernible in a subjective
side-by-side comparison with a conforming lamp, visible light is still emitted at the 10U line. Moreover, GM's photometric
analysis indicates that even with a worst case obscuration of the 10U line, the 16 candela required light output at
10U-V is supplied at 8U-V. Given that and the location of the CHMSL on the subject vehicles, these CHMSLs perform their
intended function in a manner virtually indistinguishable from CHMSLs on other vehicles that fully comply with FMVSS
108, as demonstrated below.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
The specified range of required photometric output for CHMSLs from 10U to 5D was developed from SAE J186a and is presumably
intended to allow manufacturers latitude in locating CHMSLs for the myriad of vehicle designs, while assuring that
sufficient light is available to signal drivers of following vehicles. For example, the 10U photometric angle helps
to assure that drivers of large vehicles (such as medium and heavy duty trucks), perceive a preceding vehicle's CHMSL
signal, regardless of the size of that vehicle or the CHMSL's mounting location. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 However, the Cadillac CHMSL is mounted relatively high in relation to other passenger vehicles on the road, and is
located in the passenger compartment, not on the deck lid. Therefore, the light emitted from the Cadillac CHMSL at
the upward-most photometric angles is not as critical as light at those same angles emitted from vehicles with CHMSLs
located rearward and closer to the ground. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 To illustrate this point, GM compared the Cadillac CHMSL to the CHMSL on the Mazda Miata. The Miata sits comparatively
low to the ground, and its CHMSL is mounted low on the deck lid. After determining that the 16 candela photometric output
required by FMVSS 108 at 10U-V is provided by the Cadillac CHMSL with a worst case intrusion at 8U, GM overlaid the mounting
location and 10U line of the Mazda Miata on a drawing of the Cadillac CHMSL and 8U line, placing the rear of the vehicles
at the same location *
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*. The result shows that the 8U and 10U lines cross 37.4 feet behind the vehicles and 9.3 feet above the ground;
until that point, the Cadillac CHMSL provides more light to the extreme up positions than does the fully compliant
Miata CHMSL. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 GM then overlaid on the drawing of the Cadillac and Miata CHMSLs the average eye ellipse location for heavy duty trucks
(cab over) and medium duty trucks, which are 7.7 feet and 6.8 feet from ground, respectively *
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*. The fact that these eye-ellipse locations fall well below the 9.3 feet intersection point of the Cadillac
CHMSL 8U line and the Miata CHMSL 10U line demonstrates that the Cadillac CHMSL provides sufficient usable light to
all following drivers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 That is, because GM designed the subject vehicles with a high and forward CHMSL mounting location, drivers sitting
at the highest positions from the road will see the photometric output intended by the Standard for the upward-most
angles, regardless of (worst case) obscuration of the lamp. The Cadillac CHMSL actually provides a greater area of
visible light than a vehicle with a fully compliant lamp that is mounted lower and rearward. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 There are vehicles with fully compliant CHMSLs, at mounting locations approximating that of the Cadillac, that cast
more light in the upper extreme areas behind the vehicle. However, *
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9*
<!-- PJG 0060 hspace -->
&blank;9* a compliant CHMSL (mounted at the same location as the Cadillac CHMSL) will provide only an additional triangular
area six feet in length and eleven inches high of potentially usable light, starting 20 feet behind the vehicle. This
small area is only visible to drivers of the largest vehicles. Given that and negligible decrease of light emitted
by the Cadillac CHMSL, GM believes that the Cadillac CHMSL will perform its intended function effectively identical
to fully compliant CHMSLs mounted at the same location. Furthermore, as demonstrated above, the Cadillac CHMSL provides
more light at the extreme up angles than other fully compliant CHMSLs mounted lower and rearward. These factors, together
with the small number of Cadillacs involved, support GM's belief that the CHMSLs at issue here will not have an adverse
affect on motor vehicle safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The CHMSLs otherwise meet all FMVSS 108 requirements, and the photometric output of the stop lamps, which are supplemented
by the CHMSL, far exceeds FMVSS 108 minimum requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 GM is not aware of any accidents, injuries, owner complaints or field reports related to this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 General Motors believes that the noncompliance that results from a small obstruction of the CHMSL by blackout paint
on the rear window is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. In consideration of the foregoing, General
Motors petitions that it be exempted from the recall and remedy provisions of the Act for this specific noncompliance
with FMVSS 108.

In presenting its arguments, GM has separated its noncomplying vehicles into two categories, those in which the diminished
luminous intensity of the CHMSL might be discernible, and those in which it might pass unnoticed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The noncompliance that is most likely to have a consequential effect on safety is the degradation in light output that
``would likely be discernible in a subjective side-by-side comparison with a conforming light.'' This appears to
occur only in vehicles where compliance along the 10U line is affected. GM argues that, in the worst case, there is full
compliance along a hypothetical 8U line, and that ``visible light is still emitted at the 10U line.'' Thus, the effect
on safety of a diminished luminous intensity in the two degrees between 8U and 10U must be considered. GM has pointed
out the obvious, that the mounting height of the CHMSL is not standardized among vehicles, and that factor, in addition
to the differing eye height of following drivers and the angle of approach, results in an infinite number of perceptions.
The result of this is that, in some instances, the noncompliant Cadillac CHMSL ``actually provides a greater area
of visible light'' than a complying CHMSL ``that is mounted lower and rearward.'' With respect to the two-degree area
of noncompliance, a complying lamp ``will provide only an additional triangular area six feet in length and eleven
inches high of potentially usable light, starting 20 feet behind the vehicle.'' Terming this a ``small area,'' GM
submits that it ``is only visible to drivers of the largest vehicles.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 NHTSA reviews noncompliances involving performance failures with special concern, and it has done so here. But it
has concluded that GM has met this concern with respect to the possible effect of this specific noncompliance upon
motor vehicle safety, and has decided that it does not affect safety in a consequential manner.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to the remaining noncompliances, those that might not be discernible to the naked eye, GM cites NHTSA's
previous grants of inconsequentiality petitions based upon the agency's conclusion that a change in luminous intensity
of approximately 25 percent must occur before the human eye can discern a difference. Three-quarters of GM's noncompliant
lamps probably are said to have a noncompliance in luminous intensity that does not exceed 20 percent of Figure 10's
specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 GM has correctly noted NHTSA's position on the effect of deviations in luminous intensity. Additional support for
that position has been provided in a recent report ``Driver Perception of Just-Noticeable Differences of Automotive
Signal Lamp Intensities'' (DTNH22&hyph;92&hyph;D&hyph;07002) which found that 25 percent is a reasonable criterion
for use in inconsequentiality decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Accordingly, the applicant has met its burden of persuasion that the noncompliance herein described is inconsequential
to safety, and General Motors Corporation is hereby exempted from the notification requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30118
and the remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. 30120.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice announces the decision by NHTSA that 1988 Volvo 740 Sedans not originally manufactured to comply with
all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation into the United States because
they are substantially similar to a vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States
and certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the U.S.-certified version of the 1988
Volvo 740 Sedan), and they are capable of being readily altered to conform to the standards.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor
vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has decided that the motor
vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the
United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. &sect;30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year
as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily altered to conform to all applicable
Federal motor vehicle safety standards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Petitions for eligibility decisions may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with
NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

Western Cascade of Seattle Washington (Registered Importer R&hyph;94&hyph;023) petitioned NHTSA to decide whether
1988 Volvo 740 Sedans are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA published notice of the petition
on September 27, 1994 (59 FR 49281) to afford an opportunity for public comment. The reader is referred to that notice
for a thorough description of the petition. No comments were received in response to the notice. Based on its review
of the information submitted by the petitioner, NHTSA has decided to grant the petition.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The planning and management chapter has been developed with Regional input over a period of several months. The Directorate
has reviewed the chapter for consistency with Regional goals and the mission of the Service. The chapter ensures consistency
with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), including the Draft ``Refuges 2003'' Plan/Environmental Impact
Statement (March 1993_to be completed in 1995), and the Service's Ecosystem Approach to Fish and Wildlife Conservation
(March 1994) and associated National Implementation Guidance (June 1994). The major objectives of comprehensive
management planning, as outlined in the chapter, are: (1) To ensure that management of NWRS lands reflects policies
and goals of the NWRS and the purposes for which each was established; (2) to ensure that all units contribute to the
conservation of biological diversity and to the structure and function of the ecosystem in which they are located;
(3) to provide a clear statement of the desired future conditions of the planning unit as it should be when system and
individual unit purposes are accomplished; (4) to provide a systematic process to aid decision making by identifying
opportunities, issues, and concerns; collecting, organizing, and analyzing information; and developing and considering
a range of management alternatives; (5) to aid in determining the compatibility of uses on Service units; (6) to ensure
that other Service programs, other agencies, and the public have opportunities to participate in management decision
making for each Service unit; (7) to provide a uniform basis for budget requests for operational, maintenance, and
capital development programs that accomplish unit and NWRS purposes; (8) to provide a basis for monitoring progress
and evaluating plan implementation; (9) to identify unit objectives and management strategies leading to their
achievement; and (10) to provide long-term continuity in unit management.
