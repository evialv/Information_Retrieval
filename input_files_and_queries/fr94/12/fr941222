'' on the right hip, and that certain steers imported into the United States from Mexico be marked with a permanent,
legible ``M'' on the right hip, rather than on the jaw. These marking requirements are necessary to ensure that all
steers and spayed heifers imported into the United States from Mexico, except those imported directly to slaughter
or in-bond for feeding and return to Mexico, are clearly identifiable as being of Mexican origin. These marking requirements
will facilitate the disease surveillance and traceback activities conducted in the United States under the National
Cooperative State-Federal Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations in 9 CFR part 92 prohibit or restrict the importation of certain animals into the United States to prevent
the introduction of communicable diseases of livestock and poultry. Subpart D of part 92 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(&sect;&sect;92.400 through 92.435), referred to below as the regulations, pertains to the importation of ruminants.
Sections 92.424 through 92.429 of the regulations contain specific provisions regarding the importation of ruminants,
including cattle, from Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One of the diseases addressed by the regulations is bovine tuberculosis (referred to below as tuberculosis). Tuberculosis
is a serious communicable disease of cattle, bison, and other species, including humans, caused by 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Mycobacterium bovis. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Tuberculosis in animals causes weight loss, general debilitation, and sometimes death. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Each year, approximately 1 million cattle are imported into the United States from Mexico. The vast majority of those
cattle_about 99 percent_are young steers; the remaining 1 percent consists of spayed heifers and intact cattle (i.e.,
calves, bulls, and unspayed females). The steers and spayed heifers are, with few exceptions, consigned to pastures
or feedlots for finish feeding prior to slaughter. Most intact cattle are integrated into herds in the United States
for breeding purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The period between 1982 and 1992 saw a significant increase in the number of Mexican-origin cattle found at slaughter
in the United States to be infected with tuberculosis. In 1982, 78 samples submitted from slaughtered Mexican-origin
cattle showed evidence of tuberculosis; that number rose to 613 in 1992. In 1982, 33 percent of the tuberculosis investigations
at slaughter involved Mexican origin cattle; in 1992, that number rose to 81 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
That increase in the incidence of tuberculosis in Mexican-origin cattle led the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) to publish in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59963&hyph;59965, Docket No. 93&hyph;006&hyph;1), a proposed rule to amend the regulations
to require that spayed heifers and intact cattle (i.e., calves, bulls, and unspayed female cattle) imported into
the United States from Mexico be branded with an ``M'' on the jaw using a hot iron, which was the same requirement that
applied to most steers imported from Mexico. Based on the comments we received from individuals and organizations
opposed to that proposal, as well as public concern that branding on the jaw caused unnecessary distress to cattle,
we withdrew the November 12, 1993, proposed rule referenced above and replaced it with an alternative proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the alternative proposal, which was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on August 24, 1994 (59 FR 43506&hyph;43508, Docket No. 93&hyph;006&hyph;2), we proposed to amend the regulations
to require that certain spayed heifers imported into the United States from Mexico be marked with a permanent, legible
``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' on the right hip, and that certain steers imported into the United States from Mexico be marked with a permanent,
legible ``M'' on the right hip, rather than on the jaw. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We solicited comments concerning our alternative proposal for a 60-day period ending October 24, 1994. We received
more than 12,000 comments by that date. They were from private citizens, animal rights organizations, a member of
Congress, cattle industry associations, ranchers, representatives of State governments, and a veterinary medical
association. We carefully considered all of the comments we received. They are discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters did not address the specific provisions of the proposed rule; rather, they either demanded that APHIS
discontinue face branding or stated that they supported APHIS' proposal to discontinue face branding of steers.
We have, therefore, taken such comments to support that aspect of the proposal that would change the location of the
``M'' brand on steers from the jaw to the right hip. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A few commenters objected to the proposed rule in its entirety because they felt that APHIS should conduct its disease
surveillance activities as it sees fit and should not capitulate to outside pressure to change its methods. We have
made no changes in this final rule based on such comments because we believe that the provisions of the proposed rule
and this final rule do not negatively affect APHIS' ability to conduct its disease surveillance activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several commenters felt that moving the brand from the face to the hip was no improvement, and that all M-branding should
be discontinued. We have made no changes in this final rule based on such comments because we continue to believe, for
the reasons discussed below, that some type of permanent marking is necessary to identify cattle imported into the
United States from Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter urged APHIS to keep the location of the brand on the jaw because branding on other locations can markedly
reduce the value of the hide. While it is true that marking methods such as hot-iron branding and freeze branding do
damage the hides of cattle and would likely result in some loss of value, many private entities such as cattle owners
and feedlots routinely brand cattle on areas of the hide that would have trimmed to produce a ``clean'' hide. Moreover,
we do not believe that the economic considerations associated with the placement of the brand on the hip are significant
enough to warrant such a change in this final rule, especially given the degree of public support for our proposal to
relocate the brand from the jaw to the hip. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters stated that the location of the brand should remain on the jaw, which has been set aside by some State
livestock agencies for ``government'' brands. They argued that brands on the hip would be less visible and could be
easily confused with registered ownership brands_a number of which are similar to the ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark has been used by APHIS for the placement of ``S'' brands under the brucellosis regulations in 9 CFR part 78 since
1983, and we are unaware of any identification problems resulting from that requirement. In terms of the visibility
of the ``M'' or ``M

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

will be able to readily discern the mark when necessary. Therefore, we have made no changes in this final rule as a result
of those comments.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the anatomical reference point specified for location of the brand on the hip_between the
fourth to seventh coccygeal vertebrae_is on the moveable part of the tail and could not accommodate a 2- to 3-inch brand.
Although the regulatory text of the proposed rule called for the placement of the ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark on the ``right hip, high on the tailhead,'' the anatomical reference point specified for the placement of the
mark was, as pointed out by the commenter, incorrect. To remedy that error, we have changed the specific anatomical
reference point to ``over the junction of the sacral and first coccygeal vertebrae'' in the regulatory text of this
final rule. Another commenter stated that the specified area is concave on thin cattle, which would result in incomplete,
unreadable brands on such cattle. We do not believe that the concavity of the area near the tailhead on most cattle would
be pronounced enough to result in an appreciable number of unreadable brands. Additionally, if an animal were to be
offered for importation with an unreadable ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark, that animal would be refused entry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that the placement of the brand on the hip would make it possible for a person to modify the brand
by, for example, branding an additional line or symbol close to the ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
''; having done that, the person could attempt to portray the modified brand as an ownership brand in order to disguise
the animal's Mexican origin. Certainly an ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark could be altered, just as any private or regulatory brand could be altered. However, because we are requiring
that the ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark be placed in a specific location that is not likely to be used for marking by private entities, we do not believe
that the commenter's concerns will be a problem. As mentioned above, the ``S'' brands applied to brucellosis-exposed
cattle under the regulations in 9 CFR part 78 are placed in the same location near the tailhead as the ``M'' and ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' marks are to be placed, and we are unaware of any attempts to modify those ``S'' brands during the 11 years they have
been used. Additionally, we believe that State brand registries and State animal identification regulations will
help to discourage persons from taking the actions envisioned by the commenter. We have, therefore, made no changes
in this final rule as a result of that comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter urged APHIS to expand the scope of the marking requirements to include intact Mexican cattle because
such cattle are often integrated into domestic herds for breeding purposes, thus heightening the potential for the
Mexican-origin cattle to expose domestic cattle to disease. As we explained in the proposed rule, we believe that
the small number of intact cattle imported into the United States from Mexico each year, plus the fact that the interstate
movement of intact cattle is regulated under the brucellosis regulations in 9 CFR part 78, make it significantly easier
for APHIS to trace the movement of Mexican-origin intact cattle following their entry into the United States. Therefore,
we do not believe that it is necessary to permanently identify such cattle as being of Mexican origin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter urged APHIS to expand the scope of the marking requirements to include cattle imported from Mexico in
bond for feeding and return to Mexico under &sect;92.427(e) of the regulations because such cattle are not always
returned to Mexico since the U.S. Customs Service stopped collecting the bond as a result of the North American Free
Trade Agreement. We are aware of the potential problems with the in-bond program and are currently reconsidering
the regulations governing the program. We do not, however, believe that expanding the marking requirements to include
in-bond cattle is necessary at this time. If, at some point, we determine that such a change is necessary, the change
would be proposed as part of a separate rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two commenters pointed out that APHIS currently has two proposed rules that have not yet been finalized that would
render most M-branding unnecessary. The first proposed rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on May 9, 1994 (59 FR 23810&hyph;23817, Docket No. 93&hyph;014&hyph;1), would establish comprehensive quarantine
and surveillance requirements for Mexican cattle offered for importation into the United States. The second proposed
rule, published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on November 12, 1993 (58 FR 59959&hyph;59962, Docket No. 93&hyph;084&hyph;1), would require the individual identification
on a health certificate of imported Mexican-origin cattle being moved interstate. The commenters noted that the
quarantine measures, movement restrictions, and documentation requirements contained in those proposed rules
are similar to the restrictions currently placed on cattle imported from Mexico for slaughter in accordance with
&sect;92.429 of the regulations or in bond for temporary entry in accordance with &sect;92.427(e) of the regulations.
The commenters argued that if APHIS believes that it is not necessary to brand in-bond and immediate slaughter cattle,
then it should not be necessary to brand Mexican cattle affected by the two proposed rules. Both of the proposed rules
mentioned by the commenter are still being considered by APHIS and have not been finalized. Because the provisions
of those two proposals have not been promulgated in final regulations, they have no regulatory effect; we cannot make
any changes in this final rule that are based on the provisions of other proposed regulations. However, a similar comment
was received in response to the May 1994 proposed rule mentioned above (Docket No. 93&hyph;014&hyph;1), so the suggestion
of exemptions from the branding requirement for cattle affected by the provisions of that proposed rule will be considered
and discussed in any final rulemaking related to that proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter stated that branding is unnecessary because the official Mexican Ministry of Agriculture and Water
Resources (SARH) blue eartag required by the regulations in &sect;92.427(d) can be used to identify Mexican-origin
cattle. We agree that the blue SARH eartag is an important identification tool, but we remain concerned that eartags
can be lost or removed. With the an ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark present, we could still determine an animal's country of origin if its eartag were lost or removed. Additionally,
we believe that it is less likely that someone would remove the SARH tag from an ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' marked animal in an attempt to conceal the animal's Mexican origin, so the SARH tag, with its value as a traceback
tool, is more likely to remain on the animal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that because APHIS has acknowledged that freeze branding can be used to identify cattle imported
from Mexico, APHIS should respond to the public opposition to hot-iron branding by prohibiting hot-iron branding
and requiring the use of freeze branding. Similarly, another commenter felt that freeze branding should be the standard
identification method and hot-iron branding should be allowed only if the exporter has submitted a written justification
for using hot-iron branding. Although we acknowledge that freeze branding can work as a means of identifying cattle
imported from Mexico, we also recognize that freeze branding has its limitations. First, a freeze brand takes 18 to
21 days to become visible, and there may be some exporters of cattle for whom branding that far in advance of offering
their cattle for entry into the United States is not a viable option. Second, freeze brands are not visible on white
or light-colored hair, and there will certainly be cattle offered for importation that have white or light-colored
hair at the location specified for the placement of the ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark. Because APHIS will not allow cattle with unreadable brands into the United States, requiring the use of freeze
branding would have the effect of prohibiting the importation of certain cattle based on their coloring. Therefore,
we believe that hot-iron branding should remain an option for exporters of cattle from Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter stated that freeze branding will not be an effective means of identifying Mexican-origin cattle
because so many of those cattle have light-colored hair or white spots. As discussed above, we acknowledge that freeze
branding is not going to be an option for all cattle in all cases. The regulations require a distinct, permanent, and
legible ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark on certain cattle offered for entry; we believe that it is reasonable to expect that the exporter of the cattle
will keep that requirement, as well as the advantages and limitations of hot-iron branding and freeze branding, in
mind when selecting a marking method.

Many commenters stated that APHIS should discontinue branding in favor of using microchips to individually identify
Mexican-origin cattle. Some of the commenters pointed to studies that indicated that microchip technology would
be well-suited to APHIS' stated goals of disease surveillance and traceback. We agree that microchips are useful,
but several factors prevent us from changing the regulations to require their use. We continue to believe that an identification
method must be distinct, permanent, and legible; microchips fail to fully satisfy those three criteria. In terms
of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
distinctness, we believe that the identification should be readily visible, which microchips, clearly, are not.
In terms of permanence, a microchip implanted in an animal could be removed or could migrate to other parts of the body.
In terms of legibility, information can be readily stored on and retrieved from microchips, but there is no universal
chip reader that can access the information stored on chips produced by different manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the many suggestions that APHIS use microchips to identify Mexican-origin cattle, numerous commenters
offered other alternatives to M-branding. Those commenters suggested that APHIS use: Stickers, bells, ribbons,
tail cropping, ear notching, tags, ear tags, magic markers, paint, indelible dye, stamps on the tails, and rings on
the tails. As is the case with microchips, none of these suggested identification meets our criteria for distinctness,
permanence, and legibility. Paints, dyes, stamps, and markers can fade or be obscured; stickers, bells, ribbons,
and rings can be lost or removed; and notching or cropping, although permanent, are not readily and distinctly visible
or legible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that the proposed new text of &sect;92.427(c)(2) makes no mention of freeze branding, even though
it eliminates the requirement for hot-iron branding. The commenter asked that freeze branding be mentioned, even
encouraged, in the revised regulatory text of &sect;92.427(c)(2) in order to inform persons who have read only the
regulations, and not the supplementary information provided in the proposed rule and this final rule, that freeze
branding may be used to identify cattle imported into the United States from Mexico. We agree that the marking methods
acceptable to APHIS should be set forth in the regulations and have changed the regulatory text in this final rule to
explicitly state that the ``M'' or ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark may be applied with a freeze brand or hot iron. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that although the proposed rule would allow the use of freeze branding or hot-iron branding to
mark spayed heifers, an unpublished APHIS ovariectomy protocol that requires the M-branding of certain spayed heifers_even
though that requirement is not published in the regulations_appears to require that a hot iron be used to apply the
brand. The protocol states that the ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark on spayed heifers must be a ``distinct, permanent mark which is legible on the right side of the tailhead as defined
in Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 78.'' The commenter stated that there is no definition of ``distinct,''
``permanent,'' or ``mark'' in those regulations, but there are definitions of different types of brands associated
with the APHIS brucellosis eradication program that describe the brands exclusively, or predominantly, as being
applied with a hot iron. The commenter felt that the protocol should be reworded to make it clear that freeze branding
and other methods may be used to apply the ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' mark on spayed heifers. The protocol to which the commenter is referring is part of the cooperative services agreement
between APHIS and a private sector veterinarian that provides for APHIS veterinary medical officers to monitor ovariectomies
performed on heifers located in Mexico prior to their importation into the United States. The protocol does not state
that hot-iron branding must be used or that freeze branding may not be used; the ``distinct, permanent mark'' language
was meant to allow both methods without specifying either. The revised text of &sect;92.427(c)(2) now clearly states
that either freeze branding or hot-iron branding may be used, so even if the protocol were construed to prohibit freeze
branding, the regulations would preempt the protocol and freeze branding would be allowed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters stated that APHIS should develop faster, more accurate tests for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and
work to eradicate tuberculosis in Mexico, which would eliminate the need to brand cattle from Mexico. We agree that
eradicating tuberculosis in Mexico would eliminate the need for branding cattle from Mexico, but that goal has not
yet been attained. Researchers from APHIS, other Federal agencies, and private entities are constantly working
to develop better ways to diagnose and prevent the spread of diseases, including tuberculosis. Additionally, APHIS
and the Mexican Government, along with the livestock industries in the United States and Mexico, are cooperating
in a joint effort to eradicate tuberculosis in Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters felt that since APHIS proposed to end the face branding of cattle from Mexico, it should also change
the provisions of its regulations in 9 CFR parts 50, 51, 77, 78, and 80 that allow or require face branding. We have received
similar requests and are giving them serious consideration. However, any changes to those regulations would have
to be part of a separate rulemaking proceeding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some commenters had the impression that APHIS knowingly allowed tuberculosis-infected cattle to be imported from
Mexico and was using the M-brand to identify and track those cattle. Those commenters felt that APHIS should test all
cattle offered for importation into the United States from Mexico for tuberculosis before allowing the cattle into
this country. Other commenters understood that APHIS does indeed require cattle offered for importation from Mexico
to be tested or, in the case of cattle imported for immediate slaughter under &sect;92.429, accompanied by a certificate
stating that they have been examined and found free from evidence of communicable disease, before allowing the cattle
into this country. Those commenters did, however, state that APHIS should do a better job of testing or alter its methods
to include a 60-day pre-entry quarantine followed by a tuberculosis test for cattle offered for importation into
the United States from Mexico. As mentioned above, we are considering rulemaking that would establish additional
quarantine and testing requirements similar to those mentioned by the commenter. Until such time as additional quarantine
and testing requirements are put in place, we will continue to utilize the available tools and methods in our efforts
to prevent the entry into the United States of tuberculosis from Mexico.

One commenter stated that while APHIS has said that M-branding is necessary to facilitate the disease eradication
and surveillance objectives of the National Cooperative State/Federal Tuberculosis Eradication Program, it has
failed to establish how M-branding actually serves those objectives. Because of that failure, it follows that there
is no rational basis to support the expansion of M-branding to spayed heifers and those provisions of the proposed
rule dealing with the branding of spayed heifers should be withdrawn. We believe that we have established the need
for M-branding in previous rulemakings. The permanence of branding is perhaps the key factor in our reliance on M-branding;
other identification methods can be lost, removed, or obscured. As we have stated before, M-branding is the only permanent,
readily visible means we have to identify cattle imported into the United States from Mexico. We believe that the higher
incidence of tuberculosis in Mexico makes it necessary for us to be able to identify such cattle when searching for
the origin of a tuberculosis-infected animal. If we can determine that a diseased animal originated in Mexico, we
will not waste time and effort searching for its herd of origin in the United States. Conversely, if the animal is not
M-branded, we can concentrate our disease traceback efforts to those cattle that are more likely to be of U.S. origin.
We continue to believe that M-branding serves the needs of our tuberculosis eradication efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the comments discussed above, some of the commenters raised issues that are not within the scope of the
proposed rule and, in some cases, are not within APHIS' regulatory purview. Those issues related to: The treatment
of calves by veal producers, the treatment of geese by fois gras producers, the treatment of chickens by poultry producers,
horse roping for sport in Mexico, rodeos in Mexico and the United States, the use of bovine growth hormone in dairy herds,
banning shetitah (the slaughtering of animals for food in the manner prescribed by Jewish law), conditions at zoos
in the United States, government spending to promote fur exports, the transportation of farm animals and the care
of animals injured during movement, ``factory farming,'' and the welfare of laboratory animals. Because such comments
are outside the scope of the proposed rule, no changes have been made in this final rule as a result of those comments.
Any regulatory changes related to those issues within APHIS' regulatory purview would have to be proposed as part
of a separate proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule and in this document, we are adopting the provisions
of the proposal as a final rule, with the changes discussed in this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. The rule has been determined to be not significant for the
purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Cattle imported from Mexico account for about 1 percent of the total U.S. cattle population, which in 1991 stood at
99.4 million head. The average price per head for cattle from Mexico in 1991 was $350, with the total value of imported
Mexican cattle exceeding $361 million for the year. During 1991, approximately 1 million live cattle were imported
into the United States from Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are amending the animal importation regulations to require that certain spayed heifers imported into the United
States from Mexico be marked with a permanent, legible ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' on the right hip, and that certain steers imported into the United States from Mexico be marked with a permanent,
legible ``M'' on the right hip, rather than on the jaw. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three primary considerations led APHIS to conclude that the marking requirements contained in this rule will not
have an economic impact on any U.S. entities, large or small. First, all steers imported into the United States from
Mexico, except those steers imported for immediate slaughter or in-bond for feeding and return to Mexico, were already
required to be identified with an M-brand. For these steers, which represent 99 percent of the cattle imported into
the United States from Mexico, only the location of the ``M'' has changed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second consideration follows from the first: That is, although there had been no provisions in the regulations
requiring spayed heifers to be permanently identified as being of Mexican origin, spayed heifers represent less
than 1 percent of the cattle imported into the United States from Mexico. Thus, requiring certain spayed heifers to
be marked with an ``M
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
x
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' prior to arriving at the U.S. port of entry will have an insignificant effect on exporters or importers of spayed
heifers from Mexico. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third consideration is that the cost of marking the cattle, which is negligible, will be borne by the Mexican exporter
of the cattle. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, we expect this rule will have no significant economic impact on any large or small entities because its
provisions will not significantly increase or decrease their cost of doing business. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that
this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 We are adopting as a final rule, without change, an interim rule that amended the regulations by adding Portugal to
the list of countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) exists, because the disease has been detected
in native cattle in that country. The interim rule prohibited or restricted the importation of certain fresh, chilled,
and frozen meat, and certain other animal products and animal byproducts from ruminants which have been in Portugal.
The interim rule was necessary to reduce the risk that BSE could be introduced into the United States.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (NWPA) includes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following directive: ``The Secretary [of the Department of Energy (DOE)] 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall establish a demonstration program in cooperation with the private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sector, for the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
power sites, with the objective of establishing one or more technologies that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, approve for use at the sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of civilian nuclear power reactors without, to the maximum extent practicable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the need for additional site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subsequent DOE technical evaluations and based on a full review of all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available data, the Commission approved dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181). The final rule established a new Subpart K within 10 CFR Part 72 entitled ``General License
for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Irradiated reactor fuel has been handled under dry conditions since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mid-1940s when irradiated fuel examinations began in hot cells. Light-water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor fuel has been examined dry in hot cells, since approximately 1960. Irradiated reactor fuel has been stored
continuously at hot cells under dry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions for approximately two decades. The NRC's experience with storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of spent fuel in dry casks is extensive as described in the proposed rule to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish 10 CFR Part 72, Subpart K (May 5, 1989; 54 FR 19379). Further, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States has extensive experience in the licensing and safe operation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independent spent fuel storage installations (ISFSIs). By the end of 1994, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six site-specific licenses for dry cask storage will have been issued: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Virginia Power's Surry Station, issued July 2, 1986; Carolina Power and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Light's (CP&amp;L) HB Robinson Station, issued August 13, 1986; Duke Power's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Oconee Station, issued January 29, 1990; Public Service of Colorado's Fort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
St. Vrain facility, issued November 4, 1991; Baltimore Gas and Electric's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(BG&amp;E) Calvert Cliffs Station, issued November 25, 1992; and Northern States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Power's (NSP) Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant, issued October 19, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1993. All except NSP have commenced operation and loaded fuel. At the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994, dry storage spent fuel inventories of these utilities are as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
500 assemblies at Virginia Power, 60 assemblies at CP&amp;L, 530 assemblies at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Duke Power, 1480 fuel elements at Public Service of Colorado, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
190 assemblies at BG&amp;E. NSP plans to begin storing fuel soon. In May 1993, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consumers Power's Palisades Station commenced operation and loaded fuel under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions of the general license in 10 CFR Part 72, Subpart K. At the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end of 1994, approximately 168 assemblies are stored at Palisades.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of the growing use of dry storage technology, the NRC has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gained over 35 staff years of experience in the review and licensing of dry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel storage systems. In addition, the NRC draws upon the knowledge and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience of outside scientists and engineers recognized as experts within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their respective fields in the performance of the independent safety analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the system and component designs submitted by applicants for dry cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licenses or certification. Reviews of numerous applications seeking site- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific licenses, certificates of compliance, or approvals of topical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reports, have been conducted over the past eight years. More recently, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28496), which proposed to amend 10 CFR 72.214 to include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one additional spent fuel storage cask (i.e., the VECTRA Technologies, Inc., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System) on the list of approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel storage casks that power reactor licensees may use under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of a general license issued by NRC in accordance with 10 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 72, Subpart K. The Standardized NUHOMS consists of two systems: (1) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS&hyph;24P holds 24 specified pressurized-water reactor spent fuel assemblies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and (2) The NUHOMS&hyph;52B holds 52 specified boiling-water reactor spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequent to the expiration of the 75-day public comment period on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 16, 1994, NRC received a request, dated August 11, 1994, for a 6-week 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension of the comment period from Connie Kline of the Sierra Club on behalf 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 12 citizen groups. The extension request asserted that several proprietary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documents related to this rulemaking were not available to the public for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 2 weeks at the beginning of the comment period. The NRC granted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the request on August 29, 1994 (59 FR 44381) by extending the public comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period to September 30, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VECTRA Technologies, Inc. (formerly Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted to the NRC a Safety Analysis Report (SAR) entitled ``Safety Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Report for the Standardized NUHOMS Horizontal Modular Storage System for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Irradiated Nuclear Fuel,'' NUH&hyph;003, Revision 2, dated November 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsequently, VECTRA Technologies, Inc. provided additional information to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC related to the SAR. In March 1994, the NRC issued a draft Safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Evaluation Report (SER) entitled ``Safety Evaluation Report of Pacific Nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Fuel Services, Inc. Safety Analysis Report for the Standardized NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Horizontal Storage System for Irradiated Nuclear Fuel'' approving the SAR. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC issued a draft Certificate of Compliance by letter to Mr. Robert D. Quinn 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from Mr. Frederick C. Sturz dated April 28, 1994. These documents are part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the docket and record that support the proposed rule published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
on June 2, 1994 (59 FR 28496). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of 10 CFR Part 72 is to protect the public health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety by providing for the safe confinement of the stored fuel and preventing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the degradation of the fuel cladding. The review criteria used by the NRC for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and approval of dry cask storage under 10 CFR Part 72 consider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following factors: siting, design, quality assurance, emergency planning, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training, and physical protection of the fuel. Phenomena such as earthquakes, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high winds, tornados, tornado driven missiles, lightning, and floods are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in the review of a specific system, either for a certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance or a site-specific license. In addition, applicants must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demonstrate to NRC's satisfaction that their proposed dry cask system will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resist man-made events such as explosions, fire, and drop or tipover 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accidents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on further NRC review and analysis of public comments, both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SER and Certificate of Compliance for the Standardized NUHOMS were modified. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section M contains a description of changes to the SER and Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance in response to public comments. The NRC finds that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS, as designed and when fabricated and used in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the conditions specified in its Certificate of Compliance, meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of 10 CFR Part 72. Thus, use of the Standardized NUHOMS, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved by the NRC, will provide adequate protection of the public health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety and the environment. With this final rule, the NRC is approving the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the Standardized NUHOMS under the general license in 10 CFR Part 72, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subpart K, by holders of power reactor operating licenses under 10 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 50. Simultaneously, the NRC is issuing a final Certificate of Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be effective on January 23, 1995. A copy of the Certificate of Compliance is available for public inspection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the proposed addition of the Standardized NUHOMS, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
239 comments in 27 letters with one supplement were received from individuals, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public interest groups, an environmental group, an association, industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
representatives, a city, states, and one Federal agency. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withdrew his comments. Many of these letters contained similar comments that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been grouped together and addressed as a single issue. All comments have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been grouped into 15 broad issues designated A through O. A summary of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments and an NRC analysis and response to those comments is included for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each broad issue. The NRC has identified and responded to 89 separate issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that include the significant points raised by each commenter.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of comments were related to the disposal of high-level waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the use of dry cask storage technology in general, rather than to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptability of this particular cask. Examples of these comments include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 02 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->
_The Federal Government's failure to resolve questions about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent storage of nuclear waste leaves both the plant and public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with limited options: additional storage in pools, additional storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in dry casks, or plant shutdown. The Federal Government has an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obligation to resolve the issue of permanent or interim storage. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be difficult to overstate the need for dispatch in doing so, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hundreds of American communities will eventually face this problem. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_It is not fair to the public of Ohio to link Toledo Edison Company's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attempts to continue the safe storage of its nuclear fuel with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insistence by others that the NRC shut down Davis-Besse and every other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear plant in the country. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
_Only dry storage casks that are compatible with future DOE interim or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent storage operation, including transportation, should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved for use under the general license and listed in 10 CFR 72.214.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These comments deal with broad policy and program issues relating to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage and disposal of high-level radioactive waste, including the DOE's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repository program and as such are beyond the scope of this rule. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is a summary of relevant information on many of these broad issues in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Group G. Many comments were directed at the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24P with only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a few comments being specific to the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;52B. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Many commenters discussed topics that were not the subject of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking and thus were not specifically addressed by the NRC staff as a part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this final rule action. These comments express opposition to the use of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry cask storage and included the following suggestions and topics: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Nuclear plants generating radioactive waste should be shut down. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The production of radioactive waste should be stopped when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing spent fuel pool (and off-load-reactor capacity) is full. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) A formal hearing should be required at each site using dry storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
casks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The Davis-Besse plant should be shut down. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The use of nuclear power should be stopped and existing sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cleaned up. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Palisades experienced problems in using the VSC&hyph;24 cask. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) Alternative forms of power should be used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, many commenters expressed concern over the ability of dry cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage designs, presumably including the Standardized NUHOMS, to store spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel safely. The following responses to these comments reflect a small but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important portion of the NRC's review of health, safety, and environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aspects of the Standardized NUHOMS to ensure that the cask is designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provide protection of the public health and safety and environment under both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal conditions and severe, unlikely but credible, accident conditions. Dry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask storage systems are massive devices, designed and analyzed to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shielding from direct exposure to radiation, to confine the spent fuel in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safe storage condition, and to prevent releases of radiation to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment. They are designed to perform these tasks by relying on passive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat removal and confinement systems without moving parts and with minimal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reliance on human intervention to safely fulfill their function for the term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of storage. The NRC staff has concluded that the methods of analysis are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservative and assure that the design has appropriate margins of safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under both normal and accident conditions.

Analysis of Public Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A. A number of commenters raised issues relating to cask handling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ability of the cask to withstand drop and tipover accidents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A.1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters wanted the transfer cask containing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Dry Storage Canister (DSC) to be analyzed for the maximum possible drop, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regardless of whether that drop can occur inside or outside the spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building. One commenter alleged that a drop of the transfer cask into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel pool would damage fuel assemblies in the pool. Another commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was concerned about jamming the transfer cask in the spent fuel pool. What 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would happen to the cask if jammed fuel could not be extricated? Would the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entire 40 ton transfer cask be left in the fuel pool? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Use of the Standardized NUHOMS inside the fuel handling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
building would be conducted in accordance with the 10 CFR Part 50 reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating license. These cask handling operations, including loading, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retrieval, and training, must be evaluated by the general licensee as required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(4) to ensure that procedures are clear and can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted safely. Load handling activities and possible load drop events with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structural and radiological consequences related to transfer cask drops inside 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the spent fuel building are subject to the provisions of 10 CFR 50.59. Thus, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the licensee must determine whether the activities involve any unreviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility safety question or any change in facility technical specifications. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The transfer cask and DSC designs were evaluated by the NRC against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for controlling heavy loads that are found in NRC's NUREG&hyph;0612,
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Control of Heavy Loads at Nuclear Power Plants,'' and American National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standards Institute (ANSI) N14.6, ``Special Lifting Devices for Shipping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Containers Weighing 10,000 Pounds or More.'' The lifting yoke associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the transfer cask is a special purpose device designed to ANSI N14.6 criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure that the yoke can safely lift the wet transfer cask containing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DSC out of the spent fuel pool and can safely lift the dry transfer cask and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DSC to the transport trailer. Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59, for those reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants with a shipping cask drop analysis, the licensee must verify that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipping cask drop analysis adequately describes the consequences of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postulated transfer cask drop and that no unreviewed safety question exists. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For those reactor plants that may lack a shipping cask drop analysis, each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee must perform a transfer cask drop analysis pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59.

Specific requirements for lifting the transfer cask are contained in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance and SER. However, movement of the transfer cask in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the spent fuel pool building must, as required by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(4), be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated by the licensee pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59. The possibility of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jamming a transfer cask while in the spent fuel pool is one of many issues to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be evaluated under 10 CFR 50.59. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A.2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asked why the transfer cask with the DSC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
can be lifted to 80 inches outside the spent fuel pool building when it has to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be unloaded and inspected for damage if it drops from above 15 inches. Why 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not limit the height to 15 inches? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The transfer cask with the DSC rides on the transport 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
trailer at a height of greater than 15 inches and therefore was analyzed for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drop from that height (80 inches). A drop from a height between 15 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
80 inches does not pose a public health and safety hazard. However, to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety the NRC requires the DSC to be unloaded and inspected for damage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A.3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter asked about the tipover analysis or drop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis result. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The tipover, end drops, and horizontal drop analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form part of the structural design basis for the Standardized NUHOMS design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The designer, VECTRA, described these drop and tipover analyses in SAR, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 8.2.5. The NRC's evaluation of the vendor's analyses is described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SER, Section 3.2.2.3E. The NRC found the results of these analyses to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfactory, because the calculated stresses were all within the allowable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Code. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A.4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters, citing Section 1.1.1 of the draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance, requested that the postulated cask drop accident in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plant fuel handling area be included in the list of parameters and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses that will need verification by the system user (for the 10 CFR 50.59 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety evaluation). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As stated in Section 1.1.1 of the draft Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance, a holder of a 10 CFR Part 50 license before use of the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license under 10 CFR Part 72, must determine whether activities related to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage of spent fuel involve any unreviewed facility safety issues or changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in facility technical specifications as provided under 10 CFR 50.59. Fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling including the possible drop of a spent fuel cask is among the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities that are required to be verified. Fuel handling operations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including spent fuels and fresh fuels, are routine within the nuclear power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plant and are subject to NRC regulation under 10 CFR Part 50. A holder of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 50 license is required to establish operating procedures for spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel handling and to provide emergency planning to address a potential cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drop accident in the reactor's fuel handling area (Certificate of Compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.1.4). Therefore the NRC considers it clear that the spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation in the nuclear power plant should be evaluated to verify that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible drop of a spent fuel cask does not raise an unreviewed safety issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or require a facility technical specification change appropriately regulated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under 10 CFR Part 50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A.5. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that there is no place to unload 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the spent fuel in the event of a canister breach. There is no indication that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the canister, the canister lifting mechanism, or the transport mechanism to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
move the canister into the cask, are nuclear grade equipment or have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to prevent a single failure from breaching the canister and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circumventing the protection provided by the sole barrier provided by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canister wall itself. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
According to 10 CFR 72.122(1), storage systems must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to allow ready retrieval of the spent fuel in storage. A general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee using an NRC-approved cask must maintain the capability to unload a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask. Typically, this will be done by maintaining the capability to unload a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask in the reactor fuel pool. Other options are under consideration that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would permit unloading a cask outside the reactor pool.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With respect to canister equipment and design, the DSC or canister is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC), Section III, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection NB. The DSC provides a containment boundary for the radioactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material and the cladding of the fuel rods provides confinement of fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pellets. Only intact fuel assemblies (rods) with no known cladding defects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than pin holes and hairline cracks are permitted to be stored. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach assures the structural integrity of the fuel to confine the fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pellets and its retrivability. In the unlikely event of a breach that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required the canister to be unloaded, the canister can be returned to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor spent fuel pool. Therefore, it is incorrect to assert that there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no place to unload a canister. The Horizontal Storage Module (HSM) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed to American Concrete Institute (ACI) 349, which is the required code 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for nuclear structures made of reinforced concrete. The transfer cask is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed according to the ASME BPVC, Section III, Subsection NC; ANSI-N14.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for heavy loads; ANSI&hyph;50.9 for load combinations; and NUREG/CR 1815 for impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
testing. Because the cask itself is required to meet such exacting standards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of construction, the transport mechanism and the trailer that move the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canister into the HSM are not considered to be important to safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the design that meets industry standards is sufficient. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B. A number of commenters raised issues relating to releases of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radioactivity from surface contamination and leakage from the casks under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal and accident conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B.1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter pointed out that the Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance Surveillance Requirement 1.2.12 does not have a section stating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action that is to be taken when the contamination level in the transfer cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeds limits after the DSC has been transferred to the concrete HSM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Certificate of Compliance Surveillance Requirement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Section 1.2.12 has been modified to clarify that decontamination of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transfer cask is required if the surface contamination limit is exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B.2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter, who was concerned with the seismic events at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, stated that a displacement
pulse of 60 cm, as observed in the Lander's quake in the Mojave Desert northeast of Los Angeles, would completely destroy
the HSM and allow a substantial release of radioactivity from the fuel within. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The potential for a seismic event is not the same at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
every reactor site in the United States. For Davis-Besse, the maximum ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displacement has been calculated to be 3.33 inches (8.46 cm), corresponding to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a 0.15g maximum ground acceleration. This is substantially less than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
displacement observed in the Lander's quake and appears to be well within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design of the Standardized NUHOMS. Each general licensee using the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS, including Davis-Besse is required to document their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluations to determine that the reactor site parameters, including seismic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events, envelope the cask design basis, as specified in its SAR and SER. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B.3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter, citing a Wisconsin Public Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission draft environmental impact statement (EIS) for Point Beach, asked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for an explanation of why NUHOMS and metal casks have a greater potential to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spread contamination than the Pacific Sierra Nuclear Associates ventilated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage cask (VSC) system, VSC&hyph;24 cask.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The specific rationale that forms the basis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement in the Wisconsin Public Service Commission's draft EIS for Point 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Beach was not documented. The decontamination requirements for the two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designs are comparable. The VSC&hyph;24 DSC is loaded into the ventilated concrete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask (VCC) forming the VSC. The VSC is then transported from inside the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor auxiliary building to the storage pad. During moving and storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the VCC, the exterior surface remains clean because it has not been exposed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contamination in the spent fuel pool. The NUHOMS DSC is moved in the transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask from the reactor building to the horizontal storage module in the field. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the transfer cask has been in the spent fuel pool, it may have small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amounts of external contamination that have the potential to spread during 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transit. However, any potential contamination of this type could not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant. The NRC requires that the limits for surface contamination, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers' dose, and environmental dose must all be met for the operation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ISFSI, including during any transfer operations. Each 10 CFR Part 50 licensee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must have a radiation protection program to monitor operations to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface contamination and worker and public exposure to radiation are below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptable levels and as low as is reasonably achievable (ALARA). Past 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of the NUHOMS shows that the doses are well below all NRC limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
B.4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter ``is concerned that heat generated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fission product decay may provide the driving force, the presence of free 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moisture in water-logged fuel may, in a non-mechanistic way, provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transport mechanism for fission product release and the ambient air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
circulating through the cask concrete structure may provide (an unmonitored) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathway to the biosphere.'' One commenter remained concerned about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possibility of insufficient drying of the fuel before placement in the DSC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter, citing the Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratory Report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PNL&hyph;5987 on the removal of moisture from degraded fuel during vacuum drying, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contends that the mechanism for free moisture and radionuclide release that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertain in normal or upset conditions, such as conditions caused by sabotage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have not been simulated adequately. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The DSC is a closed vessel. There is no path available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for release of fission products from inside the DSC to the atmosphere. During 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
normal operation, the circulating air, as it passes through the HSM and around 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the outside of the DSC to remove the heat, never comes in contact with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fission products and therefore, could not remove these products from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cavity of the DSC. Moreover, design basis accidents under upset conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were postulated and analyzed in the SAR and SER. These analyses show that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat generated from fission product decay is not capable of breaching the DSC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and could not provide the driving force for a release of radioactivity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, it is not expected that any significant amount of moisture will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain in the fuel after it is loaded into the DSC. The fuel is dried after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it has been loaded into the DSC and the topcover plate seal welded to the DSC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shell. The Certificate of Compliance requires two pump-downs to a vacuum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure of less than 3 mm Hg each with a holding time of greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
30 minutes. A stable vacuum pressure of less than 3 mm Hg further assures that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all liquid water has evaporated in the DSC cavity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The safeguards issue of radiological sabotage of storage casks has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed previously and assessed in the 1989 proposed rule to add Subparts K 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and L to 10 CFR Part 72 (54 FR 19379). The NRC has determined that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS is sufficiently robust such that the effects of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
successful attack would have low health consequences and are similar to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
results presented in the 1989 proposed rule. (see also response to comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
N.1)

C. A number of comments were received that focused on monitoring, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance, and inspection activities associated with dry cask storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel, particularly as they relate to the Standardized NUHOMS.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that there are neither active nor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passive systems in place to mitigate barrier breaches, nor are there active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiation monitors that would indicate a breach has occurred. There are no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitored drains and sumps nor are there retention basins. The commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the cask is insufficient to be relied upon for the health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety of Ohioans. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Certificate of Compliance (Section 1.3) for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS includes surveillance and monitoring requirements that are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more than sufficient to detect cask degradation in time to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate corrective actions can and will be taken. In addition, radiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitoring and environmental monitoring programs would detect any radiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leak in excess of NRC limits from an NRC-approved cask. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In some instances, the NRC has required continuous monitoring where it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is needed to determine when corrective action needs to be taken. Under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general license, to date, the NRC has accepted continuous pressure monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the inert helium atmosphere as an indicator of acceptable performance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mechanical closure seals for dry spent fuel storage casks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the NRC does not consider continuous monitoring for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS double-weld seals to be necessary because:

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) There are no known long-term degradation mechanisms which would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause the seal to fail within the design life of the DSC; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The possibility of corrosion has been included in the design (see 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SER Section 3.2.2.5). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These conditions ensure that the internal helium atmosphere will remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stable. Therefore, an individual continuous monitoring device for each HSM is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not necessary. However, the NRC considers that other forms of monitoring, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including periodic surveillance, inspection and survey requirements, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of preexisting radiological environmental monitoring programs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 50 during the use of the canisters with seal weld closures can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately satisfy NRC requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to the use of instrumentation and control systems to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor systems that are important to safety, the user of the Standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS will, as provided in Chapter 14 of the SER and in Section 1.3.2 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance, be required to verify, the cask thermal performance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on a daily basis by a temperature measurement, to identify conditions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threaten to approach cask design temperature criteria. The cask user will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also be required to conduct a daily visual surveillance of the cask air inlets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and outlets as required by Chapter 12 of the SER and Section 1.3.1 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the HSM and DSC are considered components important to safety, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they are not considered operating systems in the same sense as spent fuel pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling water systems or ventilation systems that may require other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instrumentation and control systems to ensure proper functioning. Due to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passive design, temperature monitoring and surveillance activities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate and sufficient to assure adequate protection of the public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety for this design. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Standardized NUHOMS DSC is welded closed and has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decontaminated before being placed in a HSM, there is no routine radioactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
liquid generation that would require a retention basin or sump. Water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entering the storage area has no mechanism of becoming contaminated because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the DSC is enclosed within the HSM and is expected to be dried by the heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated during storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter expressed concern over the possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
external corrosion of the stainless steel DSC because of exposure to water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over decades. Another commenter expressed concern about corrosion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stainless steel under conditions of indefinite duration, stating that while 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stainless steel corrodes less rapidly than carbon steel, even the plumbing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fixture industry is finding unexpected stainless steel pitting and corrosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under conditions far less intense than those in a DSC. Another commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated that the system is not designed for remote inspection of the DSC for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion while it is in the HSM and that the only way to inspect the DSC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to return it to the spent fuel pool. Periodic inspection of the DSC is needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to preclude or identify gradual canister deterioration by unknown mechanisms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter inquired about a checking system for the NUHOMS in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future. How will corrosion be evaluated on the canister (DSC) and the support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rails inside the HSM? Is it possible for them to accumulate moisture and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrode together over possibly many years of storage? What check is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the possibility that the canister couldn't be removed at the end of cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The DSC is enclosed within the HSM and is not exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to external water. Laboratory experiments have indicated a general corrosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate of less than 0.00001 inches per year for similar stainless steels. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC believes these experiments more accurately bound DSC corrosion than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experiences in unrelated industries. For the 50-year design life of the DSC, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the expected corrosion would therefore not result in exceeding a corrosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depth of 0.0005 inches. This will not affect the DSC performing its intended 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety functions. Because of the low corrosion rates expected for stainless 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
steel, periodic inspections for deterioration of the DSC are not considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary. Therefore, inspections are not required. The support rails for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the DSC have an extremely hard-alloy steel applied to the sliding surface, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground to a smooth finish, and are coated with a dry film lubricant to prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrosion and to reduce the coefficient of friction. Furthermore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment inside the HSM is protected from rain and it is kept dry by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat load from the DSC. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that corrosion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between the stainless steel and the hard alloy steel surface of the support 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rail will occur to any significant extent. These conclusions and analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regarding the very small likelihood of corrosion indicate that there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable assurance that the DSC can be removed from the HSM when required.

Comment.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter questioned whether the screens between the casks, which are essential to cooling, will remain clear
of debris and how 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they can be cleaned if they become partially clogged. Another commenter was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned about how the roof screen was inspected, stating that it seems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
likely that insects, animals, and birds will be attracted to the warm air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coming from the outlet vents. Several commenters remained concerned about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vent blockage that can completely cover and block screening and vents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly from insects such as paper wasps, that build huge nests, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
swarms of midges that are common to the Great Lakes. How are the screens 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attached?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 As stated in the Certificate of Compliance, a licensee using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Standardized NUHOMS must conduct a daily visual surveillance of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exterior of air inlets and outlets (front wall and roof bird screen). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, the licensee must perform a daily close-up inspection to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no material accumulates between the modules to block the air flow. If the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance shows blockage of air vents, the licensee is required to clear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the vent blockage by following procedures developed by each user of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS. If the screen is damaged, the licensee must replace the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screen. The required daily surveillance and temperature measurements should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
readily detect blockage of the vents or screens by insects, animals, or birds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a timely manner, leading to the removal of the obstruction before damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurs from high temperatures. The bird screen is made of stainless steel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wire cloth tack-welded to stainless steel strips, which are attached to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HSM with stainless steel wedge anchors.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter expressed concern about the presence of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burrowing and other nuisance animals that have posed problems at other waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Burrowing and other nuisance animals are not expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pose problems for the Standardized NUHOMS. Because of the robust system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design, animals will not be able to get to the radioactive material or cause 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage such that water could cause movement of the radioactive material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Burrowing under the concrete pad would not cause damage to safety-related 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components. Further, large-scale burrowing would likely be detected by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily surveillance or other activities related to the operation of the storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter wanted additional radiation monitoring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the calculated higher dose rates over previous NUHOMS designs. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter stated that these higher dose rates are not consistent with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective of maintaining occupational exposures ALARA, and that site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applications should provide detailed procedures and plans to meet ALARA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines and 10 CFR Part 20 requirements with respect to operation and

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 No additional radiation monitoring has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifically identified or required for the Standardized NUHOMS. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Parts 20, 50, and 72 require that licensees comply with ALARA. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, 10 CFR 72.212(b)(6) requires each licensee to review its radiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection program to determine that their effectiveness is not decreased by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the Standardized NUHOMS. Further, 10 CFR 72.212 (b)(9) requires each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee to conduct storage activities in accordance with appropriate written 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. If the results of these licensee activities indicate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional procedures are required then the licensee is required to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the procedures.

 One commenter was concerned about the optical survey 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equipment used to align the transfer cask with the HSM before transfer. What 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
checks are made on this optical equipment and what regulations apply?

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The optical equipment used to align the transfer cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the HSM is optional and is an operational convenience. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee must meet Technical Specifications 1.2.9 in the Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance. Therefore, only appropriate calibrations or checks to assure

compliance with this technical specification are appropriate.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wants to know who evaluates the insertion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or retrieval of the DSC for excessive vibration and what is the result of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excessive vibration. Would this allow crud to be released? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC Certificate of Compliance, Section 1.2.9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides that the cask user observe the transfer system during DSC insertion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or retrieval to ensure that motion or excessive vibration does not occur. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also prescribes certain follow-up actions to be taken by the cask user in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
event that alignment tolerances are exceeded and excessive vibration occurs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is possible that excessive vibration could dislodge crud. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
crud would be contained within the DSC and would not be released to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
atmosphere because the DSC is a sealed vessel. Any opening of the DSC will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under controlled conditions that should safely contain the crud and prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its release to the environment.

Several commenters wanted the NRC to set definite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methods for the required surveillance and monitoring of NUHOMS, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily temperature measurements, so that data are uniform and standardized for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future reference on different modules at different reactor locations.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC Certificate of Compliance for the Standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS has required temperature measurements. However, the licensee or vendor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has latitude in determining how the performance-based temperature requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be met. The NRC is not convinced that the possible benefits of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uniform, but prescriptive, surveillance and monitoring system or technique 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would outweigh the costs of curtailing the freedom of cask users to design an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation scheme suited to their individual needs. The collection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uniform data for possible future use, but without a specific regulatory need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could lead to additional exposure to workers, or adversely affect safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without any offsetting benefit.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the concrete module at a specific time and be opened?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The design life of the Standardized NUHOMS is 50 years 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as described in the SAR. The Certificate of Compliance has a 20-year approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period that can be renewed by NRC for another 20 years following a safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reevaluation. It is expected, that at the end of operation, the canister will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be removed from the concrete module and will be opened in the spent fuel pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility or an adequate dry environment alternative. The fuel will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transferred to an NRC-approved shipping cask for off-site transportation and

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters wanted, in the interest of ALARA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
principles, the capacity for approximately 24 kW heat removal to be verified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by using an artificial heat load. One commenter suggested that the NUHOMS be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
tested with a full heat load at a testing site such as Idaho National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Engineering Laboratory (INEL), and not at each reactor site that may load it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a higher heat generation rate fuel. Another commenter cited the ALARA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
philosophy of loading the oldest fuel first even though design basis fuel is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on site. Several commenters wanted deletion of the requirement (a literal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation of draft Certificate of Compliance) to calculate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature rise for each HSM loaded with canisters producing less than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design limit of 24 kW for the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Users are not normally provided the vendor's analytical models for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this calculation,

(3) Because 24 kW is the limit, virtually all the HSMs will be

A licensee is not required by NRC to load the oldest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel first but, in the interest of ALARA, it may do so. However, each time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hotter fuel is loaded up to the maximum allowed in a DSC, the licensee would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to verify the heat removal performance of the system. For fuel producing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less heat than the design limits of the system, the heat removal capacity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the system determined by calculation must be verified by temperature 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements. This process must be repeated each time a DSC is loaded with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hotter fuel until the maximum-system designed heat load is reached. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loaded with spent fuel producing 24 kW heat, the system may not have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ambient and vent outlet temperature difference of more than 100 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F for fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooled equal to or more than 5 years. This verification process is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to confirm that the as-built system of each licensee is performing as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designed. A licensee could use an artificial heat source to test an initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask at a bounding heat load of 24 kW before loading fuel. However, this test 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would only verify the spent fuel heat removal capacity of the system. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would not verify as-built performance. Experience has shown that adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verification testing can be performed at the reactor site. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performing the verification at a testing site like INEL would not provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional safety margins.

Several commenters pointed out possible conflicting

statements about temperature measurements in the surveillance requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In discussions about the heat removal capacity test, temperatures are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined only during the test period. Daily temperature measurements on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each HSM are required to verify thermal performance.

These two temperature measurement programs have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
different objectives. Temperature measurements by licensees to verify the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat capacity calculations need only be done until equilibrium is reached. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The daily temperature measurements by licensees are intended to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continued safe operation within specified limits over the life of the HSM and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be the same type of measurement done in the initial period to verify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heat removal capacity.

Regulatory requirements for general licensee users of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry storage casks are contained in 10 CFR 72.212(b). Each user must verify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the following conditions are not exceeded at their reactor site for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS: the maximum average yearly temperature with solar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incidence is 70 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F; the average daily temperature is 100 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

temperature is 125 
<!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong -->

As required by the regulations, the licensees are

required to develop detailed procedures. NRC in its regulatory oversite role 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has the opportunity to review the adequacy of the procedures. The requirement

cited by the commenter is a requirement for the licensee to verify a

temperature measurement of the thermal performance for each HSM, not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined performance of adjacent modules. A cautionary statement is included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the basis of the specification to ensure that licensee measurements of air

not the combined performance of adjacent modules.

 One commenter wanted to know how the temperature

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 For the first HSM to be emplaced, the user is required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to measure the air inlet and air outlet temperature difference of the system 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at equilibrium. This measurement is to ensure that the heat capacity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system will not be exceeded and that the concrete temperature criteria will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be exceeded. For the Standardized NUHOMS, this maximum heat capacity is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24 kW. The 24 kW heat load is the design maximum and is the basis for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal hydraulic calculations for the cask. The temperature distribution for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
various parts of the HSM have been calculated (i.e., the roof, walls, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floor) by the cask vendor. Temperature differences causing thermal stresses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the concrete were evaluated and are duly reported in both the SAR and SER. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These calculations were reviewed by NRC as a part of the overall process for

 One commenter stated that daily temperature measurements are not necessary to ensure convective air flow, given
the requirement to verify that the inlets and outlets are not obstructed. Site-specific NUHOMS require temperature
measurements when the DSC is placed into the HSM, 24 hours later, and again at 1 week after loading to ensure adequate
thermal performance.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC disagrees with this comment. The HSM and DSC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are considered components important to safety in the Standardized NUHOMS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Daily temperature measurements of the thermal performance by the licensee are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to provide additional assurance that thermal limits are not exceeded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the general license. This requirement was imposed on the first cask of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this type approved by the NRC and listed in 10 CFR 72.214 for use by a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee, the VSC&hyph;24 cask (58 FR 17967; April 7, 1994) and is now applied to

 Several commenters expressed concern that in the event 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of problems and the need to off-load fuel (as in the recent situation at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Palisades), a transfer cask may not be available in a timely manner because of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inclement weather or because the transfer cask itself has experienced problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or is being used elsewhere. One commenter expressed concern at having to have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a transfer cask on site within 40 hours of vent blockage to prevent concrete 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage. If the transfer cask is leased from VECTRA and is not at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee's site, who is liable if something happens that would require the use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of a transfer cask?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC has analyzed all design basis accidents from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operation of an ISFSI and concluded that there will be no release of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radioactive material to the environment. The 40-hour limit on vent blockage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is intended to prevent concrete degradation that might occur over a long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period of storage. A vent blockage accident would not result in the release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of radioactive material because the DSC would not be breached. Therefore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC believes that the potential risk to the public health and safety is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extremely small during the time needed to obtain the use of a transfer cask. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, there is no requirement that a transfer cask be at an ISFSI site all the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time.

 Both the vendor's SAR and NRC staff's SER address the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of tornado winds and missiles during movement of the transfer cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a loaded canister. These analyses show that, for tornado winds, there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a safety factor of 1.5 against overturning when subjected to Design Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tornado winds (a safety factor greater than 1 will generally be adequate for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public protection). The transfer cask stability, tornado missile penetration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resistance, and shell and end plate stresses were calculated and shown to be

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Safety analyses by NRC and the cask vendor show the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS can withstand floods and will continue to perform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptably. With regard to the Davis-Besse site, the licensee changed site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
topography during plant construction. Specifically, the area was built up and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some dikes were added. The plant structure's ground floor elevation is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
585 feet International Great Lakes Datum (IGLD), which is also the elevation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the pad. The licensing design basis for maximum probable static water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level on the site is 583.7 feet IGLD. As noted, the HSM and DSC were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated for flood conditions as required by 10 CFR 72.122(b). The HSM can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withstand a maximum water velocity of 15 feet per second and a static head of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
50 feet of water. The DSC can withstand a static head of 50 feet of water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any site that intends to use a Standardized NUHOMS design must evaluate the

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several comments related to the fuel to be stored in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter wanted control components contained in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies addressed in the SAR and SER citing DOE acceptance criteria. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter questioned how 55,000 MWD/MTU burnup fuel now being used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressurized water reactors will be handled since the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24 is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rated to handle only 40,000 MWD/MTU burnup fuel. Another commenter, citing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of current site-specific licensees for other NUHOMS designs, stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that higher burnup should be allowed if the decay heat and radiological source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terms are within limits. Another commenter asserted that increased fission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products from higher enriched fuel may potentially increase embrittlement of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the fuel cladding and that this needs to be evaluated in the SER. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter further alleged that this would increase the probability of more 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defective fuel being loaded into dry casks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The vendor designed the cask system for storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressurized water or boiling water reactor fuel assemblies meeting certain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications. By limiting the use of the cask system to assemblies meeting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these specifications, the vendor made a decision that may partially restrict 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of the cask. However, the NRC does not require that a cask be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
universal for all types of fuel or be usable at every reactor site. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
example, none of the casks previously listed in 10 CFR 72.214 is usable for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boiling water reactor spent fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, the 55,000 MWD/MTU burnup fuel and fuel with initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrichments of greater than 4% will have to remain in the spent fuel pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because dry spent fuel cask designs to store fuel with this higher burnup and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial enrichment or related to DOE acceptance criteria have not yet been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed and evaluated by the NRC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several comments were related to criticality safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis. One commenter questioned the conservatism of using 7.5-year cooled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel when 5-year-cooled fuel is the minimum specified and when older 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel may also be stored in the cask. Another inquired about criticality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety if the original basket geometry were compromised, as might be the case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for brittle failure of a spacer disk. In the compromised basket geometry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case, the commenter also asked about the difference in criticality safety for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a helium atmosphere rather than a borated water medium. The commenter, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referring to July 24, 1992, meeting minutes, inquired why all parties agreed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to spend any resources to make these criticality safety calculations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Standardized NUHOMS nuclear criticality safety analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is based on the following: (1) Babcock and Wilcox 15 &times; 15/208 pin fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies with initial enrichments up to 4.0 wt% of U-235 and (2) General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Electric 7 &times; 7 fuel assemblies with initial enrichments up to 4.0 wt% of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
U-235, for the Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24P and NUHOMS&hyph;52B designs respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The age of the fuel that will actually be stored is not relevant in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criticality safety analysis because the analysis assumes storage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unirradiated fresh fuel that is more reactive than cooled spent fuel. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24P system has administrative controls that limit the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
irradiated fuel reactivity to less than or equal to 1.45 wt% of U-235 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent unirradiated fuel (Certificate of Compliance Section 1.2.1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The possibility of a criticality accident caused by the brittle failure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the basket should not be a significant concern. No lifting or handling of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the DSC outside the spent fuel pool building is permitted if the basket 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature is lower than 0
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. If the user does not determine the actual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basket temperature, the ambient temperature must be used conservatively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these temperature restrictions, the basket materials will not behave in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a brittle fashion. Consequently, the basket geometry would not be compromised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by brittle failure. As for the criticality safety consideration related to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
helium atmosphere versus a borated water medium, the k
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 of the fuel in a helium atmosphere is much less than the k
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 -->
eff
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 in borated water. Therefore, criticality calculations for the borated water are sufficient because they are more
conservative and therefore would bound calculations using a helium atmosphere.

assessments for the Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter believed that using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10-year-cooled fuel for the dose assessment was nonconservative when 5-year-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooled fuel is needed to load the DSC to produce 24 kW of heat. Another, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referring to an NRC meeting with Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc. (PNFSI), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wanted clarification of an NRC request to delete a clause allowing the utility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to perform site-specific shielding calculations.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The cask vendor presented dose assessment results in the SAR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for both 5- and 10-year-cooled fuel. However, for this rulemaking, NRC used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the dose assessment for 5-year-cooled fuel for the shielding analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiation source term and for accidental releases of radionuclide material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC's use of the 5-year-cooled fuel assessment is conservative and bounding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure safe storage of spent nuclear fuel in NRC-approved casks, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC specifies, in Section 1.2.1 of the Certificate of Compliance a number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel acceptance parameters. These parameters, which may include burnup, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
initial enrichment, heat load, cooling time, and radiological source term, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
define the properties of those assemblies that can be stored in a cask. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such parameter of interest for the Standardized NUHOMS is the radiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
source term that forms the basis of the shielding analyses. For this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameter, the vendor proposed an alternative approach. Specifically, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel assemblies that fall outside the specified source term parameters but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
satisfy all other parameters, the vendor proposed to allow licensees to do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual cask shielding calculations to show compliance with the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis dose rates. This could result in more assemblies in a licensee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inventory that would be eligible for dry storage. In the instance noted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the comment, the NRC did not agree with the vendor proposal. The Certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Compliance dose rate specifications provide a simple check to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DSCs are not inadvertently loaded with the wrong fuel. The dose rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications are based on the shielding analyses provided by the vendor in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its SAR. Because of differences in non-fuel components in the ends of some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies, dose rates higher than those evaluated by NRC in the SER may occur 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the ends of casks than were assumed in the shielding analysis. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance specifications allow for this possibility and permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the licensee to store such fuel provided the licensee verifies proper cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabrication, conformance with all other fuel parameters, and compliance with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiation protection requirements. The site-specific calculations referred to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the comment are not shielding calculations, but rather are the licensee's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
written evaluations (or dose assessments) required by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(2)(iii) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to establish that the radiation criteria for ISFSI in 10 CFR 72.104 have been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
met. The Certificate of Compliance also requires that the licensee submit a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
letter report to the NRC summarizing its actions in this type of case.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters were concerned with fuel clad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
integrity issues. Particularly, they were concerned with potential problems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that may arise because of differences between vertical and horizontal storage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter noted that it was essential to inspect the cladding carefully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the minute hairline cracks which would allow the radioactivity inside to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
escape. Another commenter wanted it made clear that for fuel to be eligible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for storage it doesn't need to be specifically inspected nor require special 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling or storage provisions within the spent fuel pool. The commenter also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
asserted that pinhole leaks in fuel rod cladding do not constitute gross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breaches. The commenter wanted fuel cladding integrity clarified. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter claimed that horizontal storage of fuel rods will lead to cladding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deterioration that would challenge the technical specifications of the NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask. Another commenter was concerned about the possibility of fuel rod 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bowing that could result in weighted contact between the fuel cladding/crud 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the DSC guide sleeve, with the potential for eventual bonding of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials over the duration of the storage period. One commenter, noting that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some of the fuel in the spent fuel pools could be nearly 20 years old, was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerned that the fuel will not be tested for leaks using specific techniques 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as penetrating dyes, eddy current, sipping, or ultrasound before canister 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loading. A commenter wanted all fuel with known defects and all water-logged 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel retained in the spent fuel pool until the cask integrity under operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions is fully demonstrated. Another wanted to know how ``grossly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breached'' fuel will be ultimately handled and shipped off site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the Standardized NUHOMS, PWR fuel rods are stored in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizontal orientation and do not normally deflect in the middle of any span 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so that the rods contact the DSC guide sleeve. However, the possibility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists that a bowed rod may come in contact with the guide sleeve. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
With respect to storage of BWR fuel, the fuel channel that surrounds the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel bundle (rods) provides a barrier to separate coolant flow paths, to guide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the control rod, and to provide rigidity and protection for the fuel bundle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during handling. Therefore, the BWR fuel rods inside the channel do not come 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in contact with the guide sleeves. Even if there were contact with either PWR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or BWR fuel rods, the interaction would not present a significant concern 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the guide sleeve material is stainless steel, which has a very low 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate of corrosion, and the DSC cavity is evacuated and back-filled with inert 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
helium, which further reduces the likelihood of any corrosion or bonding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving the guide sleeve and fuel rods.

The Certificate of Compliance requires that the fuel have no known or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suspected gross cladding breaches to ensure the structural integrity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel. Known or suspected failed fuel assemblies (rods) and fuel with cladding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defects greater than pin holes and hairline cracks are not authorized in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS. Fuel meeting this specification will be safely stored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and will remain intact in storage because the dry inert atmosphere and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively low temperature will prevent deterioration of the cladding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grossly breached fuel will be handled in site-specific license applications.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Quite a few comments related to the structural stability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the HSM, particularly its response to earthquakes. Commenters questioned 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the possibility of vertical storage of the Standardized NUHOMS and suggested 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that it would be very difficult to restrain the HSM if the DSC were in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vertical position. One commenter wanted dry storage casks constructed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Building Officials Code Administrators (BOCA) National Building Code (and Ohio 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administrative Code) for structures in use group H&hyph;4, high hazard use, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
includes radioactive materials. Commenters questioned whether ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceleration as used by the NRC in its evaluation could adequately describe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all potential earthquakes east of the Rocky Mountain Front and suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a ground acceleration of 2.5g would not be realistic for all sites, despite 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proximity to fault lines. Another commenter alleged a number of seismic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
events in the midwest which had some effect in the Ohio area could cause a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete failure of the cask and requested that the NRC insist that the cask, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
containment structure, and foundation pad be designed to substantially exceed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all earthquakes with a potential for 0.60g. One commenter wanted to know if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the module had been analyzed for earthquake events at all United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor sites, according to Laurand Findmun Seismic Hazard Curves. Other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters expressed various concerns about the integrity and reaction of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS components under earthquake conditions and asked the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following questions: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Could the casks crash against each other as the ground moves beneath 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
them? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Could the module shift, crack, or move off the pad? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
How are the rail support holdings evaluated? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Could the DSC be knocked off the rails? and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Could the module roof crack and fall on the canister? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Standardized NUHOMS design described in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor's applications for approval and the SAR does not address vertical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage. Consequently, NRC neither evaluated nor approved vertical storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the system. Therefore, it may not be stored vertically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC reviewed the Standardized NUHOMS for compliance with design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria that are more stringent than those of the BOCA National Building Code 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NBC) (see response to Comment A.5). These more stringent criteria are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included in national standards that more closely represent the use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 72 specifies a design basis maximum ground acceleration of 0.25g 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for areas east of the Rocky Mountain Front that are not in areas of known 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seismic activity. All HSMs and DSCs are designed to withstand a 0.25g 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earthquake. Any reactor licensee who intends to use the Standardized NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must verify that the maximum displacements at the cask's location on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site are within the design criteria for the system. The Standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS is free standing and not dependent on the pad for safety. Failure of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the pad caused by seismic events will not cause the Standardized NUHOMS to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fail. Therefore, cask safety does not require the pad to be designed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withstand a seismic event.

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before using the Standardized NUHOMS, the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee must evaluate them to ensure the site is encompassed by the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bases of the approved cask. The events listed in the comment are among the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site-specific considerations that must be evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The site evaluation for a nuclear plant considers the effects of nearby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation and military activities. It is incumbent upon the user of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask to determine if the SER for the facility encompasses the design basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis performed for the Standardized NUHOMS or any certified cask. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
great majority of the aircraft are single-engine propeller airplanes which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typically weigh on the order of 1,500 to 2,000 pounds. The cask's inherent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design will withstand tornado missiles and other design loads and also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides protection from the collision forces imposed by these light general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aviation aircraft without adverse consequences. NUREG&hyph;800, Section 3.5.1.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Standard Review Plan for Light Water Reactors,'' contains methods and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acceptance criteria for determining if the probability of an accident 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involving larger aircraft (both Military and civilian) exceeds the acceptable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criterion. It is incumbent upon the licensee to determine whether or not the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site parameters are enveloped by the cask design basis as required by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 72.212(b)(3). These would include an evaluation demonstrating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of 10 CFR 72.106 have been met. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Turbine missile analyses typically show a very low probability of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
turbine missile breaking the turbine casing. The site's turbine missile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses must be considered as part of the facility's analysis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
suitability of the storage location. External fires are handled by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
established fire control programs. Explosions are prevented by control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combustibles under the licensee's fire protection program. Sabotage is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered under the criteria for security programs that each licensee must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement. (See also response to comment N.1).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters raised issues about the pad and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
foundation for the Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter referred to a previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking that stated that the NUHOMS casks required site-specific approvals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because they are constructed in place. Other commenters, concerned with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seismic events at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station and soil stability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues similar to cask use at the Palisades Plant, asserted that there was a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary relationship of the Standardized NUHOMS cask or module to the pad at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a specific site and that evaluation of it could not be based on the reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site seismic analysis. Each site required singular seismic and soil analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for dynamic loads and not just static loads. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NUHOMS design referred to in the July 18, 1990, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
55 FR 29181, rulemaking includes the site-specific pad as an integral part of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the concrete HSM and therefore it is important to safety. The Standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS considered in this rulemaking have the HSMs as free-standing units; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is, they have no structural connections to the pad. The Standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS does not rely on the pad to perform a safety function to protect public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and safety. The vendor analyzed the HSM containing the DSC for peak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground accelerations of 0.25g caused by earthquakes and found that it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neither slide nor overturn. NRC evaluated the Standardized NUHOMS under a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wide range of site conditions that could diminish cask safety. Further, under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC general license, before using the Standardized NUHOMS a licensee must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify that reactor site parameters are within the envelope of conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed by NRC for the cask approval. If potential conditions exist at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site (including potential erosion, soil instability, or earthquakes) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that could unacceptably diminish cask safety by any credible means, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee's analysis must include an evaluation of the potential conditions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
verify that impairment of cask safety is highly unlikely. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC's regulations do not explicitly require a licensee using a cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a general license to evaluate the cask storage pad and foundation under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such site conditions for erosion or earthquakes. If conditions at the reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site could unacceptably diminish cask safety by affecting the stability of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting foundation so as to put the cask in an unsafe condition, the cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be used unless the foundation is appropriately modified or a suitable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
location at the reactor site is found. Implicitly, therefore, the pad and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
underlying foundation materials must be analyzed under site conditions that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include erosion, soil instability, and earthquakes, even though the pad has no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
direct safety function and the cask is designed to retain its integrity even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assuming the occurrence of a range of site conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee has the responsibility under the general license to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate the match between reactor site parameters and the range of site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions (i.e., the envelope) reviewed by NRC for an approved cask. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Typically, the licensee will have a substantial amount of information already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembled in the Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) for the nuclear reactor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the envelope for the approved cask is identified in the NRC SER 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Certificate of Compliance and in the cask vendor's SAR for the cask. Of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
course, the licensee should consider whether the envelope evaluated by NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequately encompasses the actual location of the cask at the reactor site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee should also consider whether there are any site conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the actual cask location that could affect cask design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that were not evaluated in the NRC safety evaluation for the cask.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The vendor analyzed the DSC and the HSM for rigid body response (i.e., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sliding and overturning) to seismic accelerations. The resultant peak 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
horizontal ground acceleration is 0.37g and the peak vertical acceleration is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
0.17g. The margin of safety against sliding is 1.35. Similarly, the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seismic force will not cause the HSM to tip over because the stabilizing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moment of the HSM is greater than the seismic overturning moment. The margin 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of safety against overturning is 1.26. Thus, no sliding or overturning of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HSM or DSC will occur from the design earthquake. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the pad is not considered a safety-related item, a specific pad 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design is not being approved in this rulemaking for the Standardized NUHOMS.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A few commenters had questions pertaining to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation of and procedures for the Standardized NUHOMS. One commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inquired whether just one module of the Standardized NUHOMS could be purchased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a utility, or whatever number of modules desired could be procured and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
easily added like singular casks. One commenter expressed concern about snow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal procedures to prevent blockage of the bottom vents by drifting snow. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter wanted NRC to establish a procedure and criteria for dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Several commenters noted that a procedure for opening a storage cask and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removing the fuel has not been tried before nor documented in the rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
They were also concerned that unloading of a cask would place workers at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher risk.

The NRC Certificate of Compliance does not permit or limit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number of NUHOMS modules that may be purchased by a general license. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC does not regulate the commercial arrangements between the cask vendor and the users including any provisions
on the number of casks that can be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
purchased or added to the Standardized NUHOMS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Certificate of Compliance, Section 1.3, the user of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS (general licensee) is required to conduct a visual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surveillance of the exterior of air inlets and outlets. If the surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shows blockage of air vents, they must be cleaned in accordance with proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures. These procedures will minimize the potential impact to the health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety of workers. The daily temperature measurements indicate proper 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thermal performance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Certificate of Compliance requires each licensee to develop 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures to implement the dose criteria prescribed on pages A&hyph;15 and A&hyph;16. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On page A&hyph;15 of the Certificate of Compliance, Section 1.26, the dose rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria to be met is equal to or less than: (a) 200 mrem/hr. at the top 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shield plug surface at centerline with water in the cavity; and (b) 400 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mrem/hr. at the top cover plate surface at centerline without water in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cavity. On page A&hyph;16 of the Certificate of Compliance the dose rate criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is less than or equal to: (a) 400 mrem/hr. at 3 feet from the HSM surface; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 100 mrem/hr. outside of the HSM door on center line of the DSC; and (c) 20 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mrem/hr. at the end shield wall exterior. Each licensee is required to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
develop its own procedures to implement these criteria. In addition, each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee must develop operational procedures for the ISFSI for workers' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiation exposure to be ALARA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the Standardized NUHOMS, removal of spent fuel from the DSC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addressed in Chapter 5 of the SAR and in Chapter 11 of the SER. The process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is essentially the reverse of loading operations and would be performed under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reactor license radiation protection program. The Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance requires each user to develop written procedures for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations and includes precautions to be considered for unloading. ALARA is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to be addressed by 10 CFR Part 20. Specification 1.1.6 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance requires that pre-operational testing and training 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exercises include the opening of a DSC and returning the DSC and transfer cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the spent fuel pool. The Certificate of Compliance also requires the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
training program to include off-normal events.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, citing the May 1993 study prepared for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC by the Center for Nuclear Waste Regulatory Analyses of San Antonio, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Texas, questioned the relatively higher temperature consequences of dry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage on fuel cladding. The report states that, ``the dry environment has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the potential of producing such problems as further fuel cladding oxidation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increased cladding stresses, and creep deformation as a result of rod internal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pressure *&blank;*&blank;*. These possible spent fuel and cladding alteration modes could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quite accelerated under dry storage conditions, since temperatures are much 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher than in wet storage.'' The commenter does not believe that NRC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fulfilling its obligation in 10 CFR 72.122(h) to see that ``spent fuel cladding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must be protected during storage against degradation that leads to gross 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rupture.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The May 1993 study addresses the long-term geological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of high-level waste (spent fuel) and is not directed to the short-term interim storage of spent fuel at nuclear
power plants. The report 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluates processes over 10,000 years of repository performance for geological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal. The conclusions of the report are not applicable for the interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage period of a 20-year cask certificate during which spent fuels stored 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the DSC have to meet the NRC's criteria to ensure that cladding is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protected. Under normal operation of the ISFSI, leakage of radionuclides is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not expected to occur. The design and the double-seal welding of the DSC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covers are checked and tested to provide structural integrity throughout the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved storage period. During normal storage conditions, the licensee is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required to conduct a radiation monitoring program to ensure protection of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
workers and the safety of the general public. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
G. A number of comments were related to broad policy and program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues in connection with the storage and disposal of high-level radioactive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste, including the DOE repository program. Some commenters questioned the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of dry cask storage and technology in general. Some commenters stated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that only dry storage casks that would be compatible with DOE interim or final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repository operations, including transportation, should be approved for use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under a general license.

. One commenter does not want any more casks approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
until a permanent Federal repository is opened. The wet fuel pool is a proven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technology that has been successful in containing radioactivity. Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter stated that dry storage is dangerous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The NRC, in implementing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 1982, has an obligation to review dry storage technologies and to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whether to approve the use of these technologies for the storage of spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if they meet applicable safety requirements. The July 18, 1990, 55 FR 29181, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking found that spent fuel stored in dry storage casks designed to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC regulatory requirements can safely contain radioactivity. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking adds one cask design that meets the safety requirements previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed to the list of approved casks. The previous responses to comments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as the detailed safety and environmental analyses underlying this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking (and described elsewhere in this notice), all reveal that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS will conform to the NRC requirements and that its use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should not pose the potential for significant environmental impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE is required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to accept spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel for ultimate disposal. Moreover, the Commission made a generic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination in its waste Compliance Decisions (September 18, 1990, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
55 FR 38474 and August 31, 1994, 49 FR 34658) that safe disposal is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technically feasible and will be available within the first quarter of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
21st century. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dry cask storage has significant advantages over wet storage in that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system is passive and requires minimal human intervention. No pumps, filters, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or water quality monitoring are needed to maintain the conditions necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for wet storage. The only monitoring required for the Standardized NUHOMS is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily temperature monitoring and visually checking inlet and outlet vents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Consistent with the applicable procedure, the NRC does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not intend to hold formal trial-type public hearings on the Standardized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS rule or separate hearings at each reactor site before the use of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry cask technology approved by the Commission in this rulemaking. Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, used by the NRC for generic approval of the Standardized NUHOMS, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the underlying NRC staff technical reviews and the opportunity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public input, are more than adequate to obtain public input and assure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection of the public health and safety and the environment. In this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking, the NRC has taken additional steps to elicit and fully consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comments on the Standardized NUHOMS technology. These steps included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC participation in public meetings near Davis-Besse and extension of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment period by 45 days in response to public requests. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extension provided a total public comment period of almost 4 months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 133 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 authorizes the NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to approve spent fuel storage technologies by rulemaking. When it adopted the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generic process in 1990 for the review and approval of dry cask storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologies, the Commission stated that ``casks *&blank;*&blank;* [are to] be approved 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
by rulemaking
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and any safety issues that are connected with the casks are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
properly addressed in that rulemaking rather than in a hearing procedure'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(July 18, 1990; 55 FR 29181). Rulemaking under NRC rules of practice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in 10 CFR 2.804 and 2.805, provides full opportunity for expression 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of public views but does not use formal trial-type hearings of the kind 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requested by commenters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In this proceeding, rulemaking clearly provided adequate avenues for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members of the public to provide their views regarding NRC's proposed approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Standardized NUHOMS, including the opportunity to participate through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the submission of statements, information, data, opinions and arguments. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this connection, technical evaluations for Standardized NUHOMS and detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
documented findings of compliance with NRC safety, security, and environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements were prepared by the NRC staff for public examination. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 1993, the NRC staff reviewed the Standardized NUHOMS and approved the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design for the purpose of initiating this rulemaking to grant a generic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval of the design. In addition, the NRC staff conducted a second review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in response to the public comments on the Standardized NUHOMS in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking, again finding compliance with NRC requirements as discussed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to reviewing systematically and in depth the technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues important to protecting public health and safety, and the environment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC has taken extra steps to obtain and fully consider public views on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS technology and has made every effort to respond to public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns and questions about the Standardized NUHOMS compliance with NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety, security, and environmental requirements. The initial public comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period opened on June 2, 1994, and was scheduled to close on August 16, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 29, 1994, the public comment period was extended to September 30, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1994. The NRC also participated in an earlier meeting near the Davis-Besse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under these circumstances, formal hearings would not appreciably add to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC's efforts to ensure adequate protection of public health, safety, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment and they are unnecessary to NRC's full understanding and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of public views on the Standardized NUHOMS.

. One commenter stated that because there is not now and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there may not be a permanent high-level radioactive waste (HLWR) repository 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for commercial reactor fuel, and since the NUHOMS 24P and 52B casks are non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportable, any distinction between so called ``temporary storage'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``permanent disposal'' of this waste is moot. Because of the lack of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permanent repository or Monitored Retrievable Storage (MRS) in the foreseeable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future, a case of a serious spill and the resultant contamination at an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmentally unsuitable site like Davis-Besse where ``short and long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of (a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
floodplain *&blank;*&blank;* potential release of radioactive material during the lifetime of the ISFSI *&blank;*&blank;*
(and location) over an aquifer which is a major water resource'' have been inadequately dealt with.

. This rulemaking to certify the Standardized NUHOMS is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for interim storage of spent fuel in an approved cask for 20 years. It does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not authorize or approve the ultimate disposal in a permanent HLRW repository, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which is under the responsibility of the DOE. During interim storage, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
user (holder of a Part 50 license) must protect the spent fuel against design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis threats, and against environmental conditions and natural phenomena such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as tornadoes, tornado missiles, earthquakes, and floods. In regard to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flooding, the Certificate of Compliance has a provision (see A&hyph;2 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance) for flood condition analysis to ensure that there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is no release of radioactive material from flooding.

One commenter stated that projected future uses of land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time this waste may remain on site and the options for both cask and reactor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license renewal beyond 20 and 40 years, respectively, and the fact that no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known man-made structure can last for the length of time that this waste must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be isolated from humans and the environment. If an MRS or repository ever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become available, this waste may have to be repacked. Each handling of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste increases the likelihood of an accident, spill, contamination, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
worker and public exposures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Projected future land and water use can be made based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the continued safe operation of a reactor and its associated dry cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage facility. The continued operation of these facilities should have no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater impact on land and water use in the future than they do today. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously noted, the NRC Waste Confidence decisions concluded there is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable assurance that safe disposal of spent fuel by the Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Government will be available by the year 2025. Therefore, the spent fuel will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not remain at a reactor site for the length of time it must be isolated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
humans and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that the absence of significant environmental impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from dry cask storage at a reactor site is the conclusion of NRC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental assessment for the Standardized NUHOMS and for previously 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved dry casks analyzed in earlier rulemakings addressing 10 CFR Part 72, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as well as in the Commission's Waste Confidence decisions in 1984 (August 31, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1984; 49 FR 34658) and 1989 (September 29, 1989; 54 FR 39765). In the 1984 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste Confidence decision, the Commission concluded there was reasonable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance that spent fuel can be safely stored at reactor sites, without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant environmental impacts, for at least 30 years beyond expiration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC reactor operating licenses. The 1989 Waste Confidence decision review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaffirmed earlier Commission conclusions on the absence of significant

environmental impacts.

One commenter questioned whether the NUHOMS canister 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will fit the conceptual design for the DOE multi-purpose canister (MPC). If 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE chooses to use vertical casks (like the VSC) at the MRS, will the NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inner canister fit into the vertical outer concrete shell in the MPC design? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If local reactors choose the VSC&hyph;24 or the NUHOMS, will either inner metal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canister fit into the overpacks for DOE, or will they have to be opened after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage, returned to the pool, the fuel put in a new canister, and the old one

discarded as radioactive waste?

The Certificate of Compliance for the Standardized

to conform to, and has not been evaluated by NRC for conformance with, the

conceptual design for the DOE MPC. DOE has not yet made final decisions

add Subparts K and L to Part 72 indicated that the 20-year period represents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
what the Commission believes to be an appropriate increment for cask design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approvals. The application for design reapproval would have to demonstrate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cask's ability to perform the necessary safety functions for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reapproval period. The application would be evaluated by NRC against the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission's regulatory requirements. If a cask design is not reapproved, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee would have to remove casks from service as the 20-year approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage life expired. This could mean removal of the spent fuel and storing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it elsewhere.

One commenter wanted to discuss the need for an

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(NWPA) provides the following directive: ``The Secretary [of DOE] shall 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a demonstration program in cooperation with the private sector, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the dry storage of spent nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear reactor power sites, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the objective of establishing one or more technologies that the [Nuclear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory] Commission may, by rule, approve for use at the sites of civilian 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear power reactors without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for additional site-specific approvals by the Commission.'' After subsequent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DOE technical evaluations and based on a full review of all available data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Commission approved dry storage of spent nuclear fuel in a final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on July 18, 1990 (55 FR 29181). The final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule established a new Subpart K within 10 CFR Part 72, entitled ``General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
License for Storage of Spent Fuel at Power Reactor Sites.'' Therefore, there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a need for casks to be approved by NRC to implement the NWPA to meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demand of the interim dry cask storage of spent fuels in the nuclear power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plants. However, the variety of cask designs submitted by vendors for NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and approval is mostly dictated by economic reasons that do not involve 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC.

H. A number of commenters wanted site-specific analyses done for each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use of the Standardized NUHOMS despite the fact that each licensee must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine that the site parameters are enveloped by the cask design specified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the SAR, SER, and Certificate of Compliance. The intent of Subpart K of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 72 was to grant a general license to licensees of power reactors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use NRC-approved dry storage casks listed in 10 CFR 72.214 without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional licensing review by NRC.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of commenters wanted site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Impact Statements (EIS). Several commenters stated that an EIS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be required on any waste facility that may be permanent along the Great 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Lakes fresh water system. To say that this will have no adverse effect on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health and safety is a prediction most of the public does not accept. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter believes that the generic ruling to use a dry cask storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design at any reactor site is impossible and should be discarded. By relying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on environmental evaluations done in the 1970s before Davis-Besse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
construction, the NRC was remiss in its responsibility to protect the people 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Ohio from harm by its licensee. Another commenter wants the NRC to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare, at a minimum, an Environmental Assessment (EA) for each site, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including information on sensitive ecosystems, wildlife, demography, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meteorology, and geology. The EA should discuss the cask's capability to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
withstand weather conditions and potential catastrophic events. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The potential environmental impacts of utilities using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Standardized NUHOMS (or any of the other spent fuel casks approved by NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(10 CFR 72.214)) have been fully considered and are documented in a published 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Assessment (EA) covering this rulemaking. Further, as described 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below, the EA indicates that use of the casks would not have significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impacts. Specifically, the EA notes the 30-plus years of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experience with dry storage of spent fuel have shown that the previous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensive NRC analyses and findings that the environmental impacts of dry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage are small and succinctly describes the impacts, including the non-radiological impacts of cask fabrication
(the impacts associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively small amounts of steel, concrete, and plastic used in the casks are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to be insignificant), the radiological impacts of cask operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(the incremental offsite doses are expected to be a small fraction of and well 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the 25 mrem/yr limits in NRC regulations), the potential impacts of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible dry cask accident (the impacts are expected to be no greater than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts of an accident involving the spent fuel storage basin), and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential impacts from possible sabotage (the offsite dose is calculated to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
about one rem). All of the NRC analyses collectively yield the singular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion that the environmental impacts and risks are expected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extremely small. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC EA's for previously approved dry casks also concluded there was an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
absence of significant environmental impacts from dry cask storage at a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site when they were analyzed in earlier rulemakings addressing 10 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Part 72 as well as in the Commission's Waste Confidence decisions in 1984 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(August 31, 1984; 49 FR 34658) and 1989 (September 29, 1989; 54 FR 39765). In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1984 Waste Confidence decision, the Commission concluded there was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasonable assurance spent fuel can be safely stored at reactor sites, without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant environmental impacts for at least 30 years beyond expiration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC reactor operating licenses. The 1989 Waste Confidence decision review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reaffirmed earlier Commission conclusions on the absence of significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impacts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Given the Commission's specific consideration of environmental impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of dry storage and the absence of any new information casting doubt on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conclusion that these impacts are expected to be extremely small and not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmentally significant, the NRC is not convinced that meaningful new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental insights would be gained from either a new site-specific EIS or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EA for each site using dry storage methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The EA covering the proposed rule, as well as the finding of no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant impact (FONSI) prepared and published for this rulemaking, fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comply with the NRC environmental regulations in 10 CFR Part 51. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission's environmental regulations in Part 51 implement the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and give proper consideration to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
guidelines of the Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ). The EA and FONSI 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepared as required by 10 CFR Part 51 conform to NEPA procedural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. Further analyses are not legally required.

The regulation 10 CFR Part 72, Subpart K, already authorizes dry cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage and approves dry casks for use by utilities to store spent fuel at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor sites. See 10 CFR 72.214 for a listing of information on Cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate Nos. 1000 through 1003, 1005, and 1007. The purpose of this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule is to add one more cask to the list of casks already approved by NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The cask added to the list in &sect;72.214 by this final rule complies with all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable NRC safety requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, this final rulemaking applies to the use of this cask by any

 One commenter stated that the January 30, 1994, reply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from NRC's Robert Bernero to Mr. Adamkus, EPA, is completely inadequate, as is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the March 1994 ``Draft Environment Assessment and Finding of No Significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Impact'' because no consideration is given to the site's unsuitability even for LLRW per NRC's own admission, and
``new information which could alter the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
original site evaluation findings'' is ignored. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This final rule does not provide any site-specific NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval or address site-specific parameters that are peculiar to a particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site. The rule only adds one cask design, the Standardized NUHOMS, to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the list of approved casks available for use by a power plant licensee in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accordance with the conditions of the general license in Part 72. Pursuant to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those conditions, each licensee must determine whether or not the reactor site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters (including earthquake intensity and tornado missiles) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
encompassed by the cask design bases considered in the cask SAR and SER. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EA and FONSI for this rule are limited in scope to the Standardized NUHOMS in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a generic setting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Unlike interim storage prescribed in 10 CFR Part 72, the in-ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal of radioactive material, whether high-level or low-level waste (HLW 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or LLW), must take into account the geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics of the site or region to isolate the radioactive waste from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the accessible environment. Site criteria for in-ground disposal of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radioactive wastes enable an applicant to choose an appropriate site, one with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a combination of favorable conditions that will be a natural barrier to retard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or attenuate the migration of any leaked radioactive material over a long 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period to control releases within acceptable limits. The disposal period for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
LLW is on the order of 500 years, and for HLW it is greater than 10,000 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, site characteristics are investigated and assessed for interim 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel storage under Part 72, not to determine their suitability as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
barrier to release of radioactive material, but rather to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequency and the severity of external natural and artificial events that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could affect the safety of an ISFSI. Unlikely, but credible, severe events 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are considered to determine the safety of the storage cask design.

 One commenter stated that the NRC has not approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologies for the use of spent fuel at the sites of *&blank;*&blank;* without the need for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional site reviews. If that were so, no additional site review would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been necessary at Palisades, nor would an SAR revision or a Certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The approval and use of dry storage technologies under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the provisions of the general license are relatively new. Questions were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raised by members of the public about the possible effects of earthquakes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erosion at the Palisades site on the safe storage of spent fuel in the VSC&hyph;24 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry casks. As the agency which is responsible for questions about compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with regulatory requirements, which oversees such matters as the ``cop on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beat,'' the NRC began an independent assessment to more closely examine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
behavior of the pad at Palisades under normal conditions, under the long-term 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects of erosion, and under conditions of a postulated earthquake that might 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cause the sand below or around the pad to move. The results of NRC's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment were documented in the NRC Final Safety Assessment of Independent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) Support Pad (TAC No. M88875). As is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the case at all sites, NRC requires the cask user to determine if the design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basis for the storage technology being considered encompasses the site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parameters at the location where the fuel is to be stored. The review at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Palisades confirmed this to be the case. As experience with use of this new 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design is gained, modifications to the design described in the SAR are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected and allowed under the provisions of 10 CFR 72.48.

 This rulemaking does not cover site-specific NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensees; however, the NRC is not ignoring them. Under NRC regulations, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
utility has two options in using dry cask storage of spent fuel: (1) The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee may apply for a site-specific license from NRC; or (2) the licensee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may use an NRC-approved cask under the general license provisions of Subpart K 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 10 CFR Part 72. However, not all licensees may be able to use the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license provisions, either because the fuel type they possess is not storable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in any cask listed in 10 CFR 72.214 or because none of the cask designs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
envelope the reactor site parameters. The NRC is also not ignoring site-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific license considerations relating to modifying cask designs. Quite the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contrary, the criteria that apply to modifications of an NRC-approved cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such as the Standardized NUHOMS are the same as the criteria that apply to

modifications of site-specific ISFSIs.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 A utility's use of the Standardized NUHOMS, for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage of spent fuel in casks at a reactor site, would not have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact on the environment. This finding is supported by the NRC safety and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental evaluations for the Standardized NUHOMS, including the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicant's demonstration of compliance of the cask with NRC requirements, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
well as by the 1990 rulemaking on dry cask storage and the 1984 and 1989 waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidence proceedings. Because the Standardized NUHOMS can only be used by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee if the site parameters are enveloped by the cask design basis, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this rulemaking, the NRC reviewed the cask vendor's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed means for transporting the Standardized NUHOMS canister and transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask outside the reactor buildings to the on-site storage pad under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage requirements of 10 CFR Part 72. This on-site movement occurs within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an owner-controlled area where access can be limited and where operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be safely managed by the general licensee. The NRC did not review the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS for transport off-site, for example to a DOE MRS or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
repository. Generally, off-site transport of spent fuel occurs in public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
places where the shipper has fewer access restrictions and limited control of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the surroundings. Off-site spent nuclear fuel shipments must be made in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation cask approved by the NRC pursuant to NRC's regulations found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 71, ``Packaging and Transportation of Radioactive Material,'' and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must also comply with pertinent Department of Transportation (DOT) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. At this time, the NRC is approving the Standardized NUHOMS for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage only.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter wanted to know the relationship between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Standardized NUHOMS and the NUHOMS MP187 now applying for a Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance. Is the MP187 transportable? Will the canister of all models fit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the transport overpack? Wouldn't a utility be better off waiting for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportable cask rather than choosing a storage only cask that may have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compatibility problems with an MPC system? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The MP&hyph;187 transportation overpack uses a canister 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to the Standardized NUHOMS. However, it is the subject of a separate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC review as part of a site-specific licensing application. Both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standardized NUHOMS and the MP&hyph;187 share many common design features. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, they are separate applications, and the NRC has not been asked by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask vendor to review whether the Standardized NUHOMS can be transported in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NUHOMS MP187 transportation overpack. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The issue of whether a utility should consider the transportability of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dry storage casks is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter cited a report given at the HLW Conference at Las Vegas, in 1990, ``Integrated Spent Fuel Storage and
Transportation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Systems using NUHOMS,'' by PNFSI (page 671): ``While subsequent transfer of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intact DSC from a NUHOMS on-site transfer cask directly to an OCRWM rail/barge 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is feasible, this method of transfer is not preferred since the assemblies 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be oriented top down and the DSC bottom shield plug and grapple ring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assembly would be orientated top up, thus complicating the canister opening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and fuel handling process at the MRS or geologic repository following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shipment.'' Has NRC evaluated this situation? Has it been rectified? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Because the cask vendor applied for certification of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Standardized NUHOMS only as a storage cask under 10 CFR Part 72, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation of this cask is not a subject of this rulemaking. Therefore, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC review of the standardized NUHOMS did not consider the particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transportation problem described in the comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
J. Several commenters supported the rule stating that it is beneficial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the NRC and licensees, and it is consistent with NRC's direction to avoid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary site-specific licensing reviews. Others disagreed and asked 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific questions about NRC's approval and oversight process.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that the NRC statement, ``The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule will not have adverse effect on public health and safety,'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be guaranteed and, therefore, even though it may be convenient for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear industry and the NRC to avoid site-specific approvals, in this case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these are essential for maintaining public safety. Another commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following the same theme questioned how the following determination was made: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``this cask, when used in accordance with the conditions specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance and NRC regulations, will meet the requirements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 72; thus, adequate protection of the public health and safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be ensured.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Dry storage casks approved by the NRC for use under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general license are of a robust design that relies on generic cask features to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure protection of the public health and safety. Additional NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site-specific approvals are unnecessary. NRC oversight and inspections are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sufficient to ensure that general licensees implement NRC conditions on cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use. If specific concerns are raised, the NRC also has the authority to look 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into them and respond as necessary to protect public health and safety. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC has established specific requirements in 10 CFR Part 72 that must be met 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in order to obtain a Certificate of Compliance for a cask. The details of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
review and the bases for the NRC concluding that the cask meets the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements of 10 CFR Part 72 are provided in the SER. The goal of dry cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage technology is to store spent fuel safely. That goal, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effectiveness of the technology, have been demonstrated empirically and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
experimentally. Different cask designs may require different types of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis to demonstrate their safety. Therefore, different review methods may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be appropriate to reach that conclusion. In each case, the level of review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed is that needed to provide assurance of adequate protection of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public health and safety.

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Several commenters expressed concern over the exemption 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to 10 CFR 72.234(c) granted to VECTRA to begin transfer cask fabrication (but 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not use) ``to have the necessary equipment available for use by Davis-Besse 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) in mid-1995, and thus enable DBNPS to maintain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
complete full-core off-load capability in its spent fuel pool following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
refueling outage scheduled for early 1996.'' One commenter said that seeking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comment and providing comments is an exercise in futility because cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval seems to be a fait accompli. Another commenter wants no exemptions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for fabrication before certification to be allowed, stating that problems have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed when all these exemptions are allowed.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The NRC granted VECTRA's request for an exemption to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabricate the transfer cask before issuance of the Certificate of Compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under its NRC-approved quality assurance program. NRC's exemption decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made a special effort to clarify that fabrication was entirely at VECTRA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
financial risk and did not ensure favorable consideration of VECTRA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application. The NRC's finding, based on the SAR for the Standardized NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the NRC's SER, concluded that beginning fabrication before the issuance of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Certificate of Compliance would pose no undue risk to public health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety. Use of the transfer cask is dependent on satisfactory completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC's certification process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff carefully considers the public comments received in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemakings to determine whether changes are needed to the proposed rule. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
noted elsewhere in this notice, several public comments received in this and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other cask-approval rulemakings have resulted in changes to the SER and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance. For this reason, the public comments provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
useful inputs to the NRC's safety approval process.

divested itself of any ownership or relationship to the VSC design in January

 The key individual involved in the design and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
development of the VSC&hyph;24, who was also involved in the design and development 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the NUHOMS design, left Pacific Nuclear and formed a new company, Pacific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sierra Nuclear, for the commercial manufacture and marketing of the VSC&hyph;24 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage system. The NRC has experienced no difficulty obtaining the required 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety information, including proprietary information or answers to its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questions from either firm, either before or after divestiture. The NRC is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not aware of any relationship between the vendors. In addition, the NRC fully 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reviewed the health and safety aspects of each vendor's cask design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
independently. The NRC did not rely on any assumed relationship between the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two vendors. Concerning their relationship to the DOE MPC system, each vendor

has to establish its own relationship with DOE.

The NUHOMS&hyph;52B has not been used yet. Pre-operational testing of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that even though dry cask storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
passes all NRC rules and is one of the least expensive methods, it would seem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that a different location or more expensive storage method is worth lives, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resources, and property. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on numerous NRC reviews and growing experience 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with dry cask storage technologies, the NRC has concluded that spent fuel can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be safely stored in dry casks without significant risk to the public health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and safety. More expensive storage techniques or alternative storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
locations would not provide any significant additional public protection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, the storage location is a matter of Congressional policy as reflected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Section 218(a) of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, which includes the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following directive: ``The Secretary [of DOE] shall establish a demonstration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program in cooperation with the private sector, for the dry storage of spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nuclear fuel at civilian nuclear power reactor sites, with the objective of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishing one or more technologies that the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may, by rule, approve for use at the sites of civilian nuclear power reactors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
without, to the maximum extent practicable, the need for additional site-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific approvals by the Commission.'' Section III(a) also finds that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generators of the spent fuel have the primary responsibility to provide for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the interim storage of the spent fuel until it is accepted by the DOE. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The type of spent fuel stored in the dry cask storage systems is one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
factor that allows the cost of the systems to be lower. Because the fuel has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooled a number of years, passive cooling can be used rather than active 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling as is required for fuel just removed from the reactor. Passive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cooling reduces the cost by not having active components such as pumps, heat 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exchanger, water filters, and the maintenance required for these components.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter opposed licensing any dry cask storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system other than the DOE multi-purpose canister (MPC) because it minimizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
handling individual fuel assemblies, standardizes compatibility between 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage sites and DOE, and reduces cost. Multiple cask designs lead to less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expertise in production, operation, and accident management. Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations need to be amended to mandate only the use of the MPC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The DOE MPC system will not be available for general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use until well after 1997. In the meantime, additional storage capacity is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needed now at several reactor sites. Once the MPC is available for general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use, most utilities might use it. However, given the demonstrated and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediate need of some reactors for an additional storage capacity, and given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC's responsibility to implement dry cask storage under a general license 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pursuant to NWPA of 1982, it would not be prudent for NRC now to require use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of MPC designs that not even DOE has yet approved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC does not agree that the number of cask designs has a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effect on the level of expertise available because standard engineering and

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter, citing the draft SER, stated that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decommissioning and decontamination of reactors and reactor sites remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertain at best. ``At this time, it is not known whether demolition and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removal of the HSM can be performed by conventional methods *&blank;*&blank;*. The reinforced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure of the HSM, for example, will require considerable effort to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demolish.'' The commenter continues by indicating that in its typical fashion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of putting off until tomorrow what it cannot deal with today, the NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers ``ease of decommissioning (a) secondary consideration.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The demolition of the HSM will be more difficult than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typical building because of the large amount of reinforced steel it contains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, it is technically feasible and represents a likely level of effort 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to that required to demolish a bank vault. Bank vaults are routinely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
demolished without extraordinary effort. The HSM may become slightly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radioactive from being exposed to a neutron radiation field during the spent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel storage period, which would require some containment during demolition to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevent the spread of contamination. Recognizing this, the NRC considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decommissioning a secondary consideration compared to the safety afforded by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage of spent fuel in dry casks.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter questioned how, where to, and when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spent fuel and casks will go? How does the decommissioning of NUHOMS affect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the reactor decommissioning plan if no repository is sited and the pool must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remain open? Another commenter expressed concern that after the operating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility has been decommissioned, the spent fuel pool may not be available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use in recovery of a breached DSC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission determined in the Waste Confidence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decisions that sufficient repository capacity will be available, in the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quarter of the 21st century, to accept spent fuel that is already in storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or that will be generated during the lifetime of the reactor licensed by NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the Commission determined that spent fuel can be safely stored at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactors until it is disposed. The bases for these determinations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extensively discussed in the Waste Confidence decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(54 FR 39765; September 28, 1989 and 49 FR 34658; August 31, 1984) and remain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable today. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To operate the dry spent fuel storage area under the provisions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general license, a license to possess or operate a nuclear power reactor under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 50 is required. If the reactors were decommissioned and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license terminated, and if the spent fuel were to remain on site, a specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license issued under 10 CFR 72.40 would be required. At the time of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for a specific license and before the Part 50 license was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
terminated, the licensee would have to address the subject of how the fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will be repackaged for shipment to an MRS or repository. (None of the casks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
now listed in 10 CFR 72.214 are approved for transportation). Decommissioning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and termination of a Part 50 license for a given reactor site must take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account the proper disposal of any spent fuel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
L. A number of positive and negative comments were received about the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of 10 CFR 72.48 or Item 9 of the Certificate of Compliance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general licensees. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
L.1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters questioned the application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 72.48 to Certificate of Compliance holders for use by a general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee. Some commenters believe that this regulation is being 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inappropriately applied to general licensees and cask vendors. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenters believe that the regulation was intended to apply to site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licenses issued under 10 CFR 72.40 only. One commenter cited the parallel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application of 10 CFR 50.59 to 10 CFR Part 50 licensees. Any changes to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance and the supporting SAR and SER need public input 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the rulemaking process. Who would make the decisions in using the terms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``unreviewed safety questions,'' ``significant increase,'' and ``significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental impact''? Other commenters liked this addition, stating that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-safety-significant changes can be made in a timely and cost effective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner. Several commenters supported the incorporation of item number 9 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(in 72.48 type language) in the draft Certificate of Compliance. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter wanted similar provisions made for general license holders with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recordkeeping requirements applicable to the general license rather than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certificate holder. Changes requiring an amendment to the certificate should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be initiated by the certificate holder only. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC will not allow changes in the Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance under 10 CFR 72.48. However, the general licensee may make changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the SAR under 10 CFR 72.48, unless it involves an unreviewed safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
question, a significant increase in occupational exposure, or a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unreviewed environmental impact. The general licensee must make the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations, in the first instance, that are necessary for application of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 72.48. The licensee must also retain its evaluations on its records 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(which are subject to NRC review). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Supporting this application of 10 CFR 72.48 to the general license are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the words of 10 CFR 72.48(a)(1) which provides as follows: ``The holder of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
license issued under this part may: (i) Make changes in the ISFSI *&blank;*&blank;* 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described in the Safety Analysis Report, *&blank;*&blank;* (iii) *&blank;*&blank;* without prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission approval, unless the proposed change, test or experiment involves a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in the license conditions incorporated in the license, an unreviewed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
safety question, a significant increase in occupational exposure, or a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant unreviewed environmental impact.'' Also supporting the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation is 10 CFR 72.210 which provides as follows: ``A general license 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is hereby issued for the storage of spent fuel in an independent spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage installation at power reactor sites to persons authorized to possess 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or operate nuclear power reactors under Part 50 of this chapter.'' The NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staff is considering a rulemaking to amend NRC regulations to explicitly state 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that 10 CFR 72.48 applies to general licensees.

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter stated that the CFR is silent on how a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor can change a cask SAR and certificate after the final rule. It should 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be made clear for the vendor that this cask SAR (CSAR) is generic for all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
United States sites. All seismic, control component, distance, changes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
length and weight, changes in transfer devices, etc., need to be clearly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in the proposed rulemaking for the cask and the CSAR before public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment. Who would be liable if a utility requested the vendor to change a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified cask design?

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The cask vendor can apply to the NRC for a change to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cask certificate and SAR after the final rule is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. The vendor must propose the generic revisions to the certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and SAR and request NRC review of the proposed revision. The NRC will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluate the proposed revision in an SER, and if appropriate, prepare a draft 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revised Certificate of Compliance. These documents would then be placed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NRC Public Document Room and a proposed rule would be published requesting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
public comments on the proposed revised Certificate of Compliance. After 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consideration of public comments (and assuming an appropriate basis exists), a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule would be published incorporating the revision in the revised 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Certificate of Compliance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The SAR (CSAR) is not necessarily generic for all United States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operating reactor sites as the comment appears to suggest. The SAR is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertinent for those sites that have parameters that are incorporated by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask design bases analyzed in the SAR. From a practical standpoint, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult for a cask vendor to foresee all possible combinations of seismic, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
control component, distance, changes in length and weight, changes in transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
devices, etc. Revisions are expected when the vendor submits its initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
application for approval. The vendor is responsible for the certified cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
design.

One commenter wanted an explanation for not allowing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
buyer substitution of material for a Certificate of Compliance and that these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
references should be deleted from fabrication specifications and drawings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Does this mean that no changes in any materials are allowed once the design is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certified? If so, explain this in reference to new models of the VSC&hyph;24 as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
far as materials, coatings, etc.?

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 10 CFR Part 72, the licensee is permitted to make 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes in the ISFSI as described in the SAR provided the changes do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve an unreviewed safety question. The licensee and cask certificate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
holder must have a quality assurance (QA) program that provides control over 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities affecting quality of the identified structures, systems, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
components to an extent commensurate with the importance to safety and to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure conformance with the approved design. The NRC does not want buyers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(who may not be the licensee or certificate holder) of cask materials to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
automatically be able to substitute material without the necessary safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluations. Rather, the licensee, through the cask certificate holder, has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ultimate responsibility for approving any changes to ensure conformance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the approved design. For structures, systems, and components identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as important to safety, if alternative materials are desired to be used and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those specific materials form the basis of the safety evaluation, it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate to identify those materials in the cask application. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alternatively, the certificate holder may seek an amendment to the SAR and, if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary, a change to the Certificate of Compliance. For other structures, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems, or components that are needed for the design to be used or are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise prudent, but do not perform a safety function and were not relied 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon in the basis for design approval, appropriate changes may be permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided the licensee and the Certificate of Compliance holder document the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate evaluations and use their quality assurance programs to implement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the change. New models of the VSC&hyph;24 casks are not the subject of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking.

One commenter questioned how the draft Environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact would remain valid if changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to cask design and procedures can be made. Tests or experiments could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted under draft Certificate of Compliance Item No. 9 (see also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 72.48) leading to the use of a cask that does not meet the conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the Certificate of Compliance. These changes may adversely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact site-specific public health, safety, and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Given the limiting criteria of 10 CFR 72.48, it is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unlikely that any change would materially change the environmental analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The licensee's authority under 10 CFR 72.48 does not permit any changes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
involve unresolved safety issues, changes to the conditions for cask use in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Certificate of Compliance, significant increase in occupational exposure, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or significant environmental impact. In the Environmental Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
supporting this rulemaking to approve the Standardized NUHOMS, the NRC staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated various types of accidents that could happen to the ISFSI facility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff's evaluation encompassed design basis accidents and concluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that no radioactive material will be released to the environment. The NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
staff also evaluated a worst-case accident and found that the environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact is insignificant. Therefore, it is unlikely that the potential impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from changes to cask design or tests or experiments under the control of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee would introduce new environmental considerations or impacts that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differ from or exceed those as analyzed in the Environmental Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Changes in environmental impacts, as a result of changes to the cask design or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedures, must be evaluated by the licensee. The licensee's evaluations are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for inspection by the NRC.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Apparently in reference to a December 4, 1991, letter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from PNFSI that stated ``The NUHOMS Certification Safety Analysis Report (CSAR) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was *&blank;*&blank;*,'' one commenter believed that the use of the term CSAR was a good idea 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and should have been used by the NRC. The utility SAR should be called SAR as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it was and the vendor SAR should be called CSAR just as NUHOMS did in 1990. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, the acronyms topical report (TR), TSAR, and SAR are being used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interchangeably and they need clear definition. This would eliminate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confusion on the issue by those involved.

One commenter wanted the draft Certificate of Compliance

clarified as to who is responsible for the use of seismic restraints at each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site, the vendor or the utility, citing the ambiguous term

``certificate holder.''

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several commenters stated that the limits on both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neutron and gamma emission rates as well as neutron and gamma spectra 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Attachment A, Section 1.2.1 of draft Certificate of Compliance) result in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluding some fuel assemblies that would actually produce lower dose rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The problem for fuel qualification stems from the fact that the neutron dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate does not decrease as rapidly as the gamma dose rate during cooling 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the longer lived isotopes. Thus, a high burned fuel assembly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
excluded on the basis of high neutron source term may remain excluded, even 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though with extra cooling time the combined neutron/gamma dose rate could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
less than the design basis case. Some fuel may not qualify because it exceeds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the spectra requirements, even though the energy groups exceeding the limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not be significant contributors to the dose rates. Combined neutron/gamma 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dose rates are the real concern; it is recommended that the limits on source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
term be replaced by limits based on dose equivalence. The fuel specification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should allow other combinations of fuel enrichment, burnup, and cooling time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would not result in exceeding the fuel cladding temperature or dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates.

The NRC staff agrees that alternative fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specifications could be beneficial. However, this commenter did not provide a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specific alternative, and the NRC staff has not evaluated any other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative at this time because VECTRA did not include this approach in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SAR. Therefore, no other approach is considered for this rulemaking.

follows: ``Visually inspect placement of top shield plug. Re-install or

adjust position of top shield plug if it is not properly seated.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 One commenter wanted draft Certificate of Compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attachment A, Section 1.2.6, Action d deleted. The user should be permitted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to analyze and document higher dose rates under 10 CFR 72.48, which is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available for NRC review. Another commenter wanted the complete Section 1.2.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Attachment A to the draft Certificate of Compliance deleted. Given that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HSM dose rates are specified, a specification for DSC dose rates is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary because only the workers involved in the canister closure operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are affected by them and they are already covered by the reactor radiation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection program. One commenter wanted draft Certificate of Compliance, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attachment A, Section 1.2.11 deleted. Given that HSM dose rates are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified, a specification for transfer cask dose rates is not necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because only the workers involved are affected, not the general public. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter also stated that if Section 1.2.11 cannot be deleted the action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement should be revised to read as follows: ``If specified dose rates are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeded, place temporary shielding around the affected areas of the transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask or implement other ALARA actions, as appropriate. Review the plant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
records of the fuel assemblies which have been placed in the DSC to ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they conform to the fuel specifications of Section 1.2.1. The report to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC should be deleted with the user being able to analyze and document the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
higher dose rates under 10 CFR 72.48, which is available for NRC review.''

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The dose rate limits are for design purposes. The dose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rate is limited to ensure that the DSC has not inadvertently been loaded with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel not meeting the vendor/applicant spent fuel specifications. The NRC will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require reporting if the specified dose limits are exceeded. For these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons, the NRC will not grant the above requests.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter stated that the requirement for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dissolved boron concentration in the DSC of 2000 ppm is in excess of the 1810 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ppm site-specific license. The 1810 ppm dissolved boron is sufficient to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ensure reactivity below 0.95 K-eff (95/95 tolerance level with uncertainties) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assuming 24 fresh fuel assemblies. For the unlikely worst case with water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
density of 0.2 to 0.7 gm/cc (a condition not achievable for fresh fuel), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactivity remains below 0.98 K-eff. The pool dissolved-boron verification- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurement frequency should be changed from not to exceed 48 hours to once 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
per month to be consistent with 10 CFR Part 50 requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter stated that the NUHOMS&hyph;24P canister was designed using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burnup credit, the basis for licensing is ``credit for soluble boron.'' The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
burnup-enrichment curve requirement (Figure 1&hyph;1, draft Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance) should be removed until the NRC accepts burnup credit and the pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boron specification (Section 1.2.15, draft Certificate of Compliance) is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC has not yet approved the use of burnup credit in criticality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyses for spent fuel storage and transportation casks. The applicant did, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, analyze credit for burnup as an alternative design acceptance basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the NUHOMS&hyph;24P DSC, pending further consideration of burnup credit by NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed in the SER, the NUHOMS&hyph;24P DSC criticality safety is approved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on, among others, the key assumptions of loading with irradiated fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assemblies with equivalent enrichment &lt;1.45 wt% U&hyph;235, misloading unirradiated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel with maximum enrichment of 4.0 wt% U&hyph;235, and soluble boron in water for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wet loading and unloading. The NRC considered the use of the burnup- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrichment curve, Certificate of Compliance, Figure 1&hyph;1, as a fuel selection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria, to be prudent. Its use adds additional unanalyzed conservatism in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criticality safety margin. It is comparable to previous NUHOMS&hyph;24P 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approvals. Its use would also be consistent with the requirement that storage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cask designs be, to the extent practicable, compatible with removal of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stored spent fuel from the reactor site, transportation, and ultimate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposition by DOE. Therefore, the NRC disagreed with the commenter's request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to allow Standardized NUHOMS&hyph;24P users the option of using these burnup- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enrichment curve.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The comment appears to refer to the use of a NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24P associated with a site-specific license. The ``standardized NUHOMS 24P and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with a site license. The SER for this rulemaking is clear about conditions

Comment.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 One commenter citing the first paragraph of page A&hyph;27 of the draft Certificate of Compliance states that the
postulated adiabatic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heatup would result in concrete temperatures being exceeded in approximately 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 hours. As a result, it is appropriate and conservative to perform the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
visual surveillance to verify no vent blockage on a daily basis to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a blockage existed for less than 40 hours. The last sentence in the first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph should reflect that the module needs to be removed from service if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it cannot be established that the blockage is less than 40 hours, not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24 hours. A 24-hour surveillance interval will adequately verify this. One 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter cited an inconsistency in Section 3 of the draft Certificate of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compliance. Section 3.1 indicates that a module must be removed from service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
if a vent blockage is in existence for longer than 24 hours. Surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 1.3.2 indicates that a module must be removed from service if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concrete accident temperature criterion has been exceeded for more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
24 hours. A vent blockage of less than 24 hours would not cause the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
temperature limit to be exceeded, as explained in Section 1.3 and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
objective for the 24-hour frequency required by surveillance 1.3.1. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apparent conflict between Section 1.3 and the action for Surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirement 1.3.2 should be resolved. It appears that Surveillance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirement 1.3.2 actions are appropriate.

 One commenter stated that Section 1.2.14 to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Attachment A of the draft Certificate of Compliance is unnecessary because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time to transfer the DSC from the transfer cask to the HSM would normally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
require less than 8 hours. During this time, even with temperatures above 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
100
<!-- PJG 0377 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F without the solar shield, any increase in fuel clad temperature and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neutron shield temperature would be small and therefore not detrimental. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, the transfer cask is open to the atmosphere and would not

pressurize.

 The vendor, VECTRA, has proposed this limiting

on the cladding or neutron shield, should the ambient conditions involve

NUREG&hyph;0459, ``Generic Adversary Characteristics Summary Report.'' Another 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commenter made reference to an experiment with balloons which failed. Yet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another commenter questioned the degree of protection in the spent fuel pool 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
versus dry cask storage. Will the cask be in a vital area? Will safeguards 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be reviewed as part of the security plan? What is the effect on the security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these casks?

Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC reviewed potential issues related to possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiological sabotage of storage casks at reactor site ISFSIs in the 1990 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking that added Subparts K and L to 10 CFR Part 72 (55 FR 29181; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
July 18, 1990). NRC regulations in 10 CFR Part 72 establish physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection and security requirements for an ISFSI located within the owner 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled area of a licensed power reactor site. Spent fuel in the ISFSI is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by 10 CFR 72.212(b)(5) to be protected against the design basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
threat for radiological sabotage using provisions and requirements as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in 72.212(b)(5). Each utility licensed to have an ISFSI at its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site is required to develop security plans and install a security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system that provides high assurance against unauthorized activities that could 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety. The security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
systems at an ISFSI and its associated reactor are similar in design features 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to ensure the detection and assessment of unauthorized activities. Alarm 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annunciations at the ISFSI are monitored by the security alarm stations at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor site. Response to intrusion is required. Each ISFSI is periodically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspected by NRC and annually audited by the licensee to ensure that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
security systems are operating within their design limits. The validity of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the threat is continually reviewed, with a formal evaluation every six months 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC is currently conducting a study into the consequences of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicle bomb detonated in the vicinity of an ISFSI. Following completion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this study the NRC will make a determination as to whether additional physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protection is warranted. In the interim, the NRC staff believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inherent nature of the fuel, along with the degree of protection provided by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the approved storage means for spent fuel, provides adequate protection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
against a vehicle bomb. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wanted the emergency plan updated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
include initiating events caused by unnatural occurrences, such as sabotage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
particularly for this fuel storage option. The commenter believes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC should determine if upgraded or new security barriers are necessary for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the David-Besse site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under 10 CFR 72.212 requirements, each general licensee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must protect the spent fuel against the design basis threat of radiological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sabotage. Also, 10 CFR 72.212 requires each general licensee to review the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reactor emergency plan to determine whether its effectiveness is decreased, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and if so, to prepare the necessary changes and obtain the necessary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approvals. Therefore, the comment is already essentially incorporated into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
O. Several commenters had fabrication, quality assurance, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
O.1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter raised questions about NRC oversight and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for proper cask fabrication by licensees. This is based on tests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the faulty welds at the Palisades plant conducted in July 1994 just before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the cask was filled, but the test was not reviewed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The ultimate responsibility to ensure proper cask 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabrication belongs to the user of the cask. Each Part 50 licensee (general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee) must have its own quality assurance (QA) program in place to oversee 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor activities. The QA requirements apply to design, purchase, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabrication, handling, inspection, testing, operation, maintenance, repair, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modifications of structures, systems and components, and decommissioning that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are important to safety. In addition, certified cask vendors have NRC-approved QA programs that control the implementation
of these quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities in a manner appropriate to the safety significance of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities. In turn, the general licensee reviews, approves, and oversees its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vendor's QA programs and activities. The NRC inspects both the general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensee and the subtiered vendors for compliance with the respective QA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
program requirements and for the adequacy of the activities performed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The faulty welds at Palisades in a loaded cask happened because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
radiographs were not read initially. If the radiographs were read in a timely 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manner, the cask should not have been loaded without corrective action first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being taken. NRC oversight and involvement in the process contributed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
timely detection of the defective cask weld. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
O.2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wants clarification of the quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance program. NRC should have a regulatory guide for vendors with strong 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria for audits and subcontractors, and NRC inspection reports of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fabricating facilities need to be put in the PDR. How will a subcontractor of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS vendor be checked by NRC in the future? If a vendor is going to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
continuously change subcontractors, the NRC should inspect each cask and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carefully inspect the vendor QA manual. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Chapters 11 or 13 of Regulatory Guides 3.62 and 3.61, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively, provide guidance on acceptable quality assurance programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These chapters state that a QA program meeting the requirements of Appendix B 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of 10 CFR Part 50 or Subpart G of 10 CFR Part 72 will be accepted by NRC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Both Parts 50 and 72 require an audit program. An NRC Branch Technical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Position titled ``Quality Assurance Programs for an Independent Spent Fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Storage Installation (ISFSI) 10 CFR 72,'' implements the NRC review of quality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance programs submitted by applicants. NRC inspection reports are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routinely placed in the PDR except for reports containing sensitive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information. Inspection reports of NUHOMS fabrication are available in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
PDR. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

O.3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wanted to know if any nonconformances have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
been discovered in inspection reports of any fabrication of the NUHOMS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
canister. If so, what? How was this resolved? How has the QA program for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NUHOMS been reviewed? Is there a manual? How will contractors and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subcontractors be checked? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A notice of nonconformance is documented in NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Inspection Report No. 721004/93&hyph;07 dated August 23, 1993. The NRC staff 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted inspections in three phases at Duke Power Company, its contractor 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(Pacific Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc.) and subcontractor (Rancor, Inc.), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerning the QA activities with regard to the NUHOMS&hyph;24P dry spent fuel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
storage canisters. The NRC staff found that implementation of Duke Power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Company QA Program was satisfactory, in general. However, certain NRC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements under Subpart G of 10 CFR Part 72 were not met. QA activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cited in the inspection report were documentation of nonconforming materials, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parts, or components; quality assurance records; control of purchased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
material, equipment, and services; control of measuring and test equipment; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
instructions, procedures, and drawings; licensee inspection; and audits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nonconformance corrective actions were taken and documented by Duke Power 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Company. The NRC staff found these corrective actions acceptable and so 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stated in letters dated January 13, 1994, and April 4, 1994. The corrective 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
actions taken and the implementation of the QA Program are reviewed in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
periodic inspections by the NRC staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The latest version of the QA manual is ``VECTRA Technologies, Inc., 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quality Assurance Manual,'' Revision 1, transmitted July 25, 1994, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reflects the corporation's new name and organization and includes additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes to update the manual and clarify QA recordkeeping commitments. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC staff found Revision 1 acceptable and so stated in its letter dated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
August 23, 1994. In its review, the NRC staff compared Revision 1 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
VECTRA QA Manual with Revision 3, Edition 2, of the PNSI QA manual, which the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NRC staff found acceptable by letter dated January 28, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Contractors and subcontractors of cask vendors (or licensees) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to periodic QA inspections performed by the NRC staff. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

O.4. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Comment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One commenter wanted to know if there is a possible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
problem, and if there was, how it was resolved, with a material defect in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Swagelok tube fittings for NUHOMS? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Response. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NRC is not aware of any material defect problem 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with Swagelok tube fittings on NUHOMS designs. There is no reliance on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Swagelok fittings as part of the confinement boundary for the NUHOMS canister. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fittings are covered by a metal plate that is welded on after the canister 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is vacuum dried. Therefore, if there is a failure in the fitting it would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the responsibility of the licensee to repair or replace it so that the DSC can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be loaded properly, but its failure would not cause a public health and safety 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern.

Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR Part 51, that this rule is not a major Federal action significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affecting the quality of the human environment and therefore an environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact statement is not required. This final rule adds an additional cask to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the list of approved spent fuel storage casks that power reactor licensees can 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
use to store spent fuel at reactor sites without additional site-specific 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approvals from the Commission. The environmental assessment and finding of no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant impact on which this determination is based are available for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inspection at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level),

impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule affects only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensees owning and operating nuclear power reactors and cask vendors. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
owners of nuclear power plants do not fall within the scope of the definition

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board or Federal Reserve) is revising its capital adequacy guidelines
for state member banks and bank holding companies to establish a limitation on the amount of certain deferred tax assets
that may be included in (that is, not deducted from) Tier 1 capital for risk-based and leverage capital purposes. The
capital rule was developed in response to the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) issuance of Statement
No. 109, ``Accounting for Income Taxes'' (FAS 109). Under the final rule, deferred tax assets that can only be realized
if an institution earns taxable income in the future are limited for regulatory capital purposes to the amount that
the institution expects to realize within one year of the quarter-end report date_based on its projection of taxable
income_or 10 percent of Tier 1 capital, whichever is less.

A. Characteristics of Deferred Tax Assets
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Deferred tax assets are assets that reflect, for financial reporting purposes, benefits of certain aspects of tax
laws and rules. Deferred tax assets may arise because of specific limitations under tax laws of different tax jurisdictions
that require that certain net operating losses (e.g., when, for tax purposes, expenses exceed revenues) or tax credits
be carried forward if they cannot be used to recover taxes previously paid. These ``carryforwards'' are realized
only if the institution generates sufficient future taxable income during the carryforward period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deferred tax assets may also arise from the tax effects of certain events that have been recognized in one period for
financial statement purposes but will result in deductible amounts in a future period for tax purposes, i.e., the
tax effects of ``deductible temporary differences.'' For example, many depository institutions and bank holding
companies may report higher income to taxing authorities than they reflect in their regulatory reports
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 because their loan loss provisions are expensed for reporting purposes but are not deducted for tax purposes until
the loans are charged off.

State member banks are required to file quarterly Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports) with
the Federal Reserve. Bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $150 million or more file quarterly
Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y&hyph;9C reports) with the Federal Reserve.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Deferred tax assets arising from an organization's deductible temporary differences may or may not exceed the amount
of taxes previously paid that the organization could recover if the organization's temporary differences fully
reversed at the report date. Some of these deferred tax assets may theoretically be ``carried back'' and recovered
from taxes previously paid. On the other hand, when deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences
exceed such previously paid tax amounts, they will be realized only if there is sufficient future taxable income during
the carryforward period. Such deferred tax assets, and deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards, are hereafter referred to as ``deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable
income.''

B. Summary of FAS 109
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In February 1992, the FASB issued Statement No. 109, ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accounting for Income Taxes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
'' which supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11 and FASB Statement No. 96. FAS 109 provides guidance
on many aspects of accounting for income taxes, including the accounting for deferred tax assets. FAS 109 potentially
allows some state member banks and bank holding companies to record significantly higher deferred tax assets than
previously permitted under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the federal banking agencies'
prior reporting policies.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Unlike the general practice under previous standards, FAS 109 permits the reporting of deferred tax assets that are
dependent upon future taxable income. However, FAS 109 requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reduce
the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not (i.e., a greater than 50 percent likelihood) to be
realized.

The federal banking agencies consist of the Federal Reserve Board (Board), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) (hereafter,
the ``agencies''.)

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
FAS 109 became effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 15, 1992. The adoption of this standard has
resulted in the reporting of additional deferred tax assets in Call Reports and FR Y&hyph;9C reports that directly
increase institutions' undivided profits (retained earnings) and Tier 1 capital.

C. Concerns Regarding Deferred Tax Assets That Are Dependent Upon Future Taxable Income
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Federal Reserve has certain concerns about including in capital deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future
taxable income. Realization of such assets depends on whether a banking organization has sufficient future taxable
income during the carryforward period. Since a banking organization that is in a net operating loss carryforward
position is often experiencing financial difficulties, its prospects for generating sufficient taxable income
in the future are uncertain. In addition, the condition of and future prospects for an organization often can and do
change very rapidly in the banking environment. This raises concerns about the realizability of deferred tax assets
that are dependent upon future taxable income, even when an organization may be sound and well-managed. Thus, for
many organizations such deferred tax assets may not be realized, and for other organizations there is a high degree
of subjectivity in determining the realizability of this asset. Furthermore, while many organizations may be able
to make reasonable projections of taxable income for relatively short periods and actually realize this income,
beyond a short time period, the reliability of the projections tends to decrease significantly. In addition, unlike
many other assets, banking organizations generally cannot obtain the value of deferred tax assets by selling them.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Moreover, as an organization's condition deteriorates, it is less likely that deferred tax assets that are dependent
upon future taxable income will be realized. Therefore, the organization is required under FAS 109 to reduce its deferred
tax assets through increases to the asset's valuation allowance. Additions to this allowance would reduce the organization's
regulatory capital at precisely the time it needs capital support the most. Thus, the inclusion in capital of deferred
tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income raises supervisory concerns.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of these concerns, the agencies, under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council
(FFIEC), considered whether it would be appropriate to adopt FAS 109 for regulatory reporting purposes. On August
3, 1992, the FFIEC requested public comment on this matter, and on December 23, 1992, after consideration of the comments
received, the FFIEC decided that banks and savings associations should adopt FAS 109 for reporting purposes in Call
Reports and Thrift Financial Reports (TFRs) beginning in the first quarter of 1993 (or the beginning of their first
fiscal year thereafter, if later). Furthermore, the Board decided that bank holding companies should adopt FAS 109
in FR Y&hyph;9C Reports at the same time.

D. Proposal for the Treatment of Deferred Tax Assets
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FFIEC, in reaching its decision on regulatory reporting, also recommended that each of the agencies amend its
regulatory capital standards to limit the amount of deferred tax assets that can be included in regulatory capital.
In response to the FFIEC's recommendation, on February 11, 1993, the Board issued for public comment a proposal to
adopt the recommendation of the FFIEC in full, as summarized below (54 FR 8007, February 11, 1993). The FFIEC recommended
that the agencies limit the amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income that can be
included in regulatory capital to the lesser of:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
i. the amount of such deferred tax assets that the institution expects to realize within one year of the quarter-end
report date, based on its projection of taxable income (exclusive of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards
and reversals of existing temporary differences), or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. 10 percent of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage
servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences would generally not be limited under the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Public Comments on the Proposal
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The comment period for the Board's proposal ended on March 15, 1993. The Board received nineteen comment letters including
ten from multinational and large regional banking organizations, and three community banks. In addition, the Board
received four comment letters from bank trade associations and two from finance companies. Sixteen commenters offered
support for the Board's proposal to require banking organizations to 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
report, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for regulatory purposes, deferred tax assets in accordance with FAS 109. In addition, fifteen commenters indicated
that it would be preferable for the Board to place no limit on the amount of deferred tax assets allowable in capital.
These commenters indicated that, in their view, embracing FAS 109 in its entirety would achieve consistency between
regulatory standards and GAAP as well as maintain consistency with the intent of Section 121 of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) of 1991. Commenters asserted that the criteria set forth in FAS 109
to recognize and value deferred tax assets is sufficiently conservative to limit any exposure to the bank insurance
fund and that an arbitrary or mechanical formula, such as the ones proposed, would not provide a more accurate or reliable
result.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While preferring no capital limit on deferred tax assets, some commenters noted that the proposal represented a compromise
and a step forward from prior regulatory policies that permitted little or no inclusion in regulatory reports or capital
of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income. Two commenters generally supported the proposal
or expressed their understanding of the regulator's concern regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets
and one commenter indicated the capital treatment should be consistent with the capital treatment for identifiable
intangible assets.

A. Responses to the Board's Questions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Question 1: (Gross-up of Intangible Assets) Nine commenters responded to the Board's first question regarding whether
certain identifiable intangible assets acquired in a nontaxable business combination accounted for as a purchase
should be adjusted for the tax effect of the difference between the market or appraised value of the asset and its tax
basis. Under FAS 109, this tax effect is recorded separately in a deferred tax liability account, whereas under preexisting
GAAP, this tax effect reduced the amount of the intangible asset. This change in treatment could cause a large increase
(i.e., gross-up) in the reported amount of certain identifiable intangible assets, such as core deposit intangibles,
which are deducted for purposes of computing regulatory capital.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven commenters indicated that banking organizations should be permitted to deduct the net after-tax amount of
the intangible asset from capital, not the gross amount of the intangible asset. These commenters argued that FAS
109 will create artificially high values for intangible assets and the related deferred tax liability when a banking
organization acquires the assets with a carryover basis for tax purposes but revalues the asset for financial reporting
purposes. The commenters generally indicated that, under FAS 109, the balance sheet will not accurately reflect
the value paid for the intangibles. Furthermore, commenters indicated that the increased value of the intangible
posed no risk to institutions, because a reduction in the value of the asset would effectively extinguish the related
deferred tax liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On the other hand, two commenters indicated that the pretax (gross) value of intangible assets should be deducted
for regulatory capital purposes in this situation. This organization contended that intangible assets should be
treated similarly to other assets, which are not reduced by any related liability.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 2: The Board's second question inquired about (i) the potential burden associated with the proposal and
whether a limitation based on projections of taxable income would be difficult to implement, and (ii) the appropriateness
of the separate entity method for deferred tax assets and tax sharing agreements in general.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Methodology Based on Income Projections. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board received eleven letters from commenters who responded directly to this aspect of the question. Four commenters
supported using income projections and stated that calculating deferred tax asset limitations for capital purposes
based on projected taxable income would not be difficult to implement and would not impose an additional burden because
many banking organizations already forecast taxable income in order to recognize their deferred tax assets. One
commenter added that these calculations should not pose any problems, provided they are done on a consolidated basis.
In addition, one commenter suggested that the Board clarify the term ``realized within one year'' so that readers
understand that the phrase means the amount of deferred tax assets that could be used to offset income taxes generated
in the next 12 months, and not the amount of deferred tax assets that actually will be used.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters specifically opposed an income approach, citing the additional burden that would be created by the
detailed calculations. One commenter specifically favored implementing the percentage of capital method since
it is certain and exact and does not involve as many estimations or fluctuations as the income approach.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Five commenters supported an approach based on the financial condition of the institution, some of whom also offered
support or opposition to the income or percentage of capital approach. One commenter suggested that ``healthy''
institutions be permitted to include deferred tax assets in regulatory capital in an amount based on a specified percentage
of Tier 1 capital. Another commenter supported an approach that excluded ``well capitalized'' banks from the limitation.
On the other hand, one commenter did not support using an approach for calculating the capital limitation based upon
the perceived ``health'' of the institution, stating that this method could lead to arbitrary and inconsistent measures
of capital adequacy.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Separate Entity Approach. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Twelve commenters specifically addressed this part of the question. Under the Board's proposal, the capital limit
for deferred tax assets would be determined on a separate entity basis for each state member bank so that a bank that
is a subsidiary of a holding company would be treated as a separate taxpayer rather than as part of the consolidated
entity. All of the commenters opposed the separate entity approach. They argued that the separate entity approach
is artificial and that tax-sharing agreements between financially capable bank holding companies and bank subsidiaries
should be considered when evaluating the recognition of deferred tax assets for regulatory capital purposes. Commenters
also stated that the separate entity method is unnecessarily restrictive and that any systematic and rational method
should be permitted for the calculation of the limitation for each bank.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter based its opposition for the separate entity approach on the view that the limitation is not consistent
with the Board's 1987 ``Policy Statement on the Responsibility of Bank Holding Companies to Act as Sources of Strength
to Their Subsidiary Banks'' which, in some respects, treats a controlled group as one entity. Another commenter contended
that the effect of a separate entity calculation would be to reduce bank capital which is needed for future lending
which would be inconsistent with the March 10, 1993, ``Interagency Policy Statement on Credit Availability''. The
same commenter also noted that the regulatory burden and cost of calculating the deferred tax asset on a separate entity
basis would be substantial for both bankers and regulators.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Question 3: The Board's third question addressed three specific provisions of the proposal. These provisions included
(i) requiring tax planning strategies to be part of an institution's projection of taxable income for the next year,
(ii) requiring organizations to assume that all temporary differences fully reverse at the report date, and (iii)
permitting the grandfathering of amounts previously reported if they were in excess of the proposed limitation.

Inclusion of Tax Planning Strategies.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two commenters addressed this issue. Both commenters stated that they support including tax planning strategies
in an institution's projection of taxable income. One commenter stated that the proposal should be modified to permit
institutions to consider strategies that would ensure realization of deferred tax assets within the one-year time
frame. The proposal provided that organizations should consider tax planning strategies that would realize tax
carryforwards or net operating losses that would otherwise expire during that time frame.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Four commenters specifically addressed this aspect of the question, and all agreed that it is appropriate to require
the assumption that all temporary differences fully reverse as of the report date. One commenter noted that this assumption
would eliminate the burden of scheduling the ``turnaround'' of temporary differences.

Grandfathering.

Five commenters discussed the proposal's provision on grandfathering which would allow the amount of any deferred
tax assets reported as of September 1992 in excess of the limit to be phased out over a two year period ending in 1994.
Four commenters offered support for grandfathering but argued that excess deferred tax assets should be grandfathered
until the underlying temporary differences reversed, rather than be phased out over two years. The other commenter
disagreed with the grandfathering proposal and stated that such provisions would be inconsistent with the proposal's
capital adequacy objectives.

A. Limitation on Deferred Tax Assets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the FFIEC's recommendation and the Board's proposal, the Board is limiting in regulatory capital
deferred tax assets that are dependent on future taxable income to the lesser of: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
i. The amount of such deferred tax assets that the institution expects to realize within one year of the quarter-end
report date, based on its projection of taxable income (exclusive of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards
and reversals of existing temporary differences), or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ii. 10 percent of Tier 1 capital, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage
servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences are generally not limited under the final rule. The reported amount of deferred tax
assets, net of its valuation allowance, in excess of the limitation would be deducted from Tier 1 capital for purposes
of calculating both the risk-based and leverage capital ratios. Banking organizations should not include the amount
of disallowed deferred tax assets in weighted-risk assets in the risk-based capital ratio and should deduct the amount
of disallowed deferred tax assets from average total assets in the leverage capital ratio. Deferred tax assets included
in capital continue to be assigned a risk weight of 100 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To determine the limit, a banking organization should assume that all existing temporary differences fully reverse
as of the report date. Also, estimates of taxable income for the next year should include the effect of tax planning
strategies the organization is planning to implement to realize net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards
that will otherwise expire during the year. Consistent with FAS 109, the Board believes tax planning strategies are
carried out to prevent the expiration of such carryforwards. Both of these requirements are consistent with the proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The capital limitation is intended to balance the Board's continued concerns about deferred tax assets that are dependent
upon future taxable income against the fact that such assets will, in many cases, be realized. This approach generally
permits full inclusion of deferred tax assets potentially recoverable from carrybacks, since these amounts will
generally be realized. This approach also includes those deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable
income, if they can be recovered from projected taxable income during the next year. The Board is limiting projections
of future taxable income to one year because, in general, the Board believes that organizations are generally capable
of making projections of taxable income for the following twelve month period that have a reasonably good probability
of being achieved. However, the reliability of projections tends to decrease significantly beyond that time period.
Deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are further limited to 10 percent of Tier 1 capital,
since the Board believes such assets should not comprise a large portion of an organization's capital base given the
uncertainty of realization associated with these assets and the difficulty in selling these assets apart from the
organization. Furthermore, a 10% capital limit also reduces the risk that an overly optimistic estimate of future
taxable income will cause the bank to significantly overstate the value of deferred tax assets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Banking organizations already follow FAS 109 for regulatory reports and accordingly, are making projections of
taxable income. Banking organizations already report in regulatory reports the amount of deferred tax assets that
would be disallowed under the proposal. In addition, the 10 percent calculation of Tier 1 capital is straightforward.
Therefore, the Board believes that banking organizations will have little difficulty implementing this final rule.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Guidance on Specific Implementation Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to the comments received and after discussions with the other agencies, the Board is providing the following
guidance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Originating Temporary Differences_Consistent with the Board's proposal, the final rule does not specify how the
provision for loan and lease losses and other originating temporary differences should be treated for purposes of
projecting taxable income for the next year. Banking organizations routinely prepare income forecasts for future
periods and, in theory, income forecasts for book income should be adjusted for originating temporary differences
in arriving at a projection of taxable income. On the other hand, requiring such adjustments adds complexity to the
final rule. Furthermore, deductible originating temporary differences, such as the provision for loan and lease
losses, generally would lead to additional deferred tax assets. Thus, arguably, such temporary differences should
not be added back to book income in determining the amount of deferred tax assets that will be realized. Accordingly,
the Board is permitting each institution to decide whether or not to adjust projected book income for originating
temporary differences. While the Board is not specifying a single treatment on originating temporary differences
in the final rule, institutions should follow a reasonable and consistent approach.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Gross-up of Intangibles_As noted above, FAS 109 could lead to a large increase (i.e., gross-up) in the reported amount
of certain intangible assets, such as core deposit intangibles, which are deducted for purposes of computing regulatory
capital. Commenters stated that the increased value of an intangible posed no risk to institutions, because a reduction
in the value of the asset would effectively extinguish the related deferred tax liability. The Board concurs with
this position and, consequently, will permit, for capital adequacy purposes, netting of deferred tax liabilities
arising from this gross-up effect against related intangible assets. To ensure this benefit is not double counted,
a deferred tax liability netted in this manner could not also be netted against deferred tax assets when determining
the amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income. Netting will not be permitted against
purchased mortgage servicing rights (PMSRs) and purchased credit card relationships (PCCRs), since only the portion
of these assets that exceed specified capital limits are deducted for capital adequacy purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Leveraged Leases_While not expected to significantly affect many banking organizations, one commenter stated
that future net tax liabilities related to leveraged leases acquired in a purchase business combination are included
in the valuation of the leveraged lease and are not shown on the balance sheet as deferred tax liabilities. This artificially
increases the amount of deferred tax assets for those institutions that acquire a leveraged lease portfolio. Thus,
this commenter continued, the future taxes payable included in the valuation of a leveraged lease portfolio in a purchase
business combination should be treated as a taxable temporary difference whose reversal would support the recognition
of deferred tax assets, if applicable. The Board agrees with this commenter and, therefore, banking organizations
may use the deferred tax liabilities that are embedded in the carrying value of a leveraged lease to reduce the amount
of deferred tax assets subject to the capital limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tax Jurisdictions_Unlike the proposal, the final rule does not require an institution to determine its limitation
on deferred tax assets on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. While such an approach may theoretically be more
accurate, the Board does not believe the greater precision that would be achieved in mandating such an approach outweighs
the complexities involved and its inherent cost to institutions. Thus, banking organizations may make projections
of their taxable income on an organization-wide basis and use a combined tax rate for purposes of calculating the one-year
limitation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Timing_Institutions may use the future taxable income projections for their current fiscal year (adjusted for any
significant changes that have occurred or are expected to occur) when applying the capital limit at an interim report
date rather than preparing a new projection each quarter. Several commenters requested this treatment because it
reduces the frequency with which banking organizations are required to revise their estimate of future taxable income.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Available for Sale Securities_Under FASB Statement No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities'' (FAS 115), ``available-for-sale'' securities are reported in regulatory reports at market value,
and unrealized gains and losses on such securities are included, net of tax effects, in a separate component of stockholders
equity. These tax effects may increase or decrease the amount of deferred tax assets an institution reports. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board has recently decided to exclude from regulatory capital the amount of net unrealized gains and losses on
available for sale securities (except net unrealized losses of available-for-sale equity securities with readily
determinable fair values) (59 FR 63241, December 8, 1994). Thus, excluding for capital adequacy purposes deferred
tax effects arising from reporting unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities is consistent
with the regulatory capital treatment for such gains and losses. On the other hand, requiring the exclusion of such
deferred tax effects would add significant complexity to the capital guidelines and in most cases would not have a
significant impact on regulatory capital ratios. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, when determining the capital limit for deferred tax assets, the Board has decided to permit, but not require,
institutions to adjust the reported amount of deferred tax assets for any deferred tax assets and liabilities arising
from marking-to-market available-for-sale debt securities for regulatory reporting purposes. This choice will
reduce implementation burden for institutions not wanting to contend with the complexity arising from such adjustments,
while permitting those institutions that want to achieve greater precision to make such adjustments. Institutions
must follow a consistent approach with respect to such adjustments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Separate Entity Method_The proposed capital limit was to be determined on a separate entity basis for each state member
bank. Use of a separate entity approach on income tax sharing agreements (including intercompany tax payments and
current and deferred taxes) is generally required by the Board's 1978 Policy Statement on Intercorporate Income
Tax Accounting Transactions of Bank Holding Companies and State Member Banks, and similar policies are followed
by the other banking agencies. Thus, any change to the separate entity approach for deferred tax assets would also
need to consider changes to this policy statement, which is outside the scope of this rulemaking. The Board notes that
regulatory reports of banks are generally required to be filed using a separate entity approach and consistency between
the reports would be reduced if the Board permitted institutions to use other methods for calculating deferred tax
assets in addition to a separate entity approach. Thus, while a number of the commenters suggested that the Board consider
permitting other approaches, the Board will generally require the separate entity approach.

State member banks should project taxable income for the bank, generally on a consolidated basis including subsidiaries
of the bank. Bank holding companies should project taxable income for the holding company, generally on a consolidated
basis including bank and non-bank subsidiaries of the holding company.

As proposed, the final rule contains an exception to the separate entity approach when a state member bank's parent
holding company does not have the financial capability to reimburse the bank for tax benefits derived from the bank's
carryback of net operating losses or tax credits. In these cases, the amount of carryback potential the bank may consider
in calculating the capital limit on deferred tax assets is limited to the lesser amount which it could reasonably expect
to have refunded by its parent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grandfathering_The proposal would grandfather any deferred tax assets reported as of September 1992 in excess of
the proposed limit, but would require that such excess amounts be phased out over a two year period ending in 1994. Since
all grandfathered amounts are now fully amortized, the Board's final rule does not include any grandfathering provision.

IV. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board does not believe that the adoption of this final rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small business entities (in this case, small banking organizations), in accordance with the spirit and
purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). In this regard, the vast majority of small banking
organizations currently have very limited amounts of net deferred tax assets, which are the subject of this proposal,
as a component of their capital structures. In addition, this final rule, in combination with the adoption by the Board
of FAS 109 for regulatory reporting purposes, allows many organizations to increase the amount of deferred tax assets
they include in regulatory capital. Moreover, because the risk-based and leverage capital guidelines generally
do not apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $150 million, this proposal will not affect
such companies. The Board did not receive any comment letters specifically addressing regulatory flexibility concerns,
and therefore, no alternatives to the proposal were considered to address regulatory flexibility.

V. Paperwork Reduction Act and Regulatory Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board has determined that this final rule will not increase the regulatory paperwork burden of banking organizations
pursuant to the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

Section 302 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;325, 108
Stat. 2160) provides that the federal banking agencies must consider the administrative burdens and benefits of
any new regulation that impose additional requirements on insured depository institutions. Section 302 also requires
such a rule to take effect on the first day of the calendar quarter following final publication of the rule, unless the
agency, for good cause, determines an earlier effective date is appropriate.

Deductions of holdings of capital securities also would not be made in the case of interstate ``stake out'' investments
that comply with the Board's Policy Statement on Nonvoting Equity Investments, 12 CFR 225.143 (Federal Reserve Regulatory

by other banking organizations but taken in satisfaction of debts previously contracted would be exempt from any
deduction from capital. The Board intends to monitor nonreciprocal holdings of other banking organizations' capital
instruments and to provide information on such holdings to the Basle Supervisors' Committee as called for under the

Deferred tax assets.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, net of the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets, that may be included in, that is, not deducted from, a bank's capital may not exceed the lesser
of: (i) the amount of these deferred tax assets that the bank is expected to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end
date, based on its projections of future taxable income for that year,
<FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>
 or (ii) 10 percent of tier 1 capital. For purposes of calculating this limitation, Tier 1 capital is defined as the sum
of core capital elements, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage servicing
rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted). The
amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals
of existing taxable temporary differences and that do not exceed the amount which the bank could reasonably expect
to have refunded by its parent (if applicable) generally are not limited. The reported amount of deferred tax assets,
net of any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, in excess of these amounts is to be deducted from a bank's core
capital elements in determining tier 1 capital.

Projected future taxable income should not include net operating loss carryforwards to be used during that year or
the amount of existing temporary differences a bank expects to reverse within the year. Such projections should include
the estimated effect of tax planning strategies that the organization expects to implement to realize net operating
losses or tax credit carryforwards that would otherwise expire during the year. Institutions may use the future taxable
income projections for their current fiscal year (adjusted for any significant changes that have occurred or are
expected to occur) when applying the capital limit at an interim report date rather than preparing a new projection
each quarter. To determine the limit, an institution should assume that all existing temporary differences fully
reverse as of the report date.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to total assets
to assist in the assessment of the capital adequacy of state member banks.
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
 The principal objective of this measure is to place a constraint on the maximum degree to which a state member bank can
leverage its equity capital base. It is intended to be used as a supplement to the risk-based capital measure.

Supervisory risk-based capital ratios that related capital to weighted-risk assets for state member banks are outlined
in Appendix A to this part. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
b. The guidelines apply to all state member banks on a consolidated basis and are to be used in the examination and supervisory
process as well as in the analysis of applications acted upon by the Federal Reserve. The Board will review the guidelines
from time to time and will consider the need for possible adjustments in light of any significant changes in the economy,
financial markets, and banking practices.

II. The Tier 1 Leverage Ratio
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
a. The Board has established a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
minimum 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
level of tier 1 capital to total assets of 3 percent. An institution operating at or near these levels is expected to
have well-diversified risk, including no undue interest-rate risk exposure; excellent asset quality; high liquidity;
and good earnings; and in general be considered a strong banking organization, rated composite 1 under CAMEL rating
system of banks. Institutions not meeting these characteristics, as well as institutions with supervisory, financial,
or operational weaknesses, are expected to operate well above minimum capital standards. Institutions experiencing
or anticipating significant growth also are expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions,
well above the minimum levels. For example, most such banks generally have operated at capital levels ranging from
100 to 200 basis points above the stated minimums. Higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular
circumstances or risk profiles of individual banks. Thus for all but the most highly rated banks meeting the conditions
set forth above, the minimum tier 1 leverage ratio is to be 3 percent plus an additional cushion of a least 100 to 200 basis
points. In all cases, banking institutions should hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of all risks,
including the volume and severity of problem loans, to which they are exposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. A bank's tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing its tier 1 capital (the numerator of the ratio) by its average
total consolidated assets (the denominator of the ratio). The ratio will also be calculated using period-end assets
whenever necessary, on a case-by-case basis. For the purpose of this leverage ratio, the definition of tier 1 capital
for year-end 1992 as set forth in the risk-based capital guidelines contained in Appendix A of this part will be used.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 As a general matter, average total consolidated assets are defined as the quarterly average total assets (defined
net of the allowance for loan and lease losses) reported on the bank's Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report),
less goodwill; amounts of purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships that, in
the aggregate, are in excess of 50 percent of tier 1 capital; amounts of purchased credit card relationships in excess
of 25 percent of tier 1 capital; all other intangible assets; any investments in subsidiaries or associated companies
that the Federal Reserve determines should be deducted from tier 1 capital; and deferred tax assets that are dependent
upon future taxable income, net of their valuation allowance, in excess of the limitation set forth in section II.B.4
of this Appendix A.

At the end of 1992, Tier 1 capital for state member banks includes common equity, minority interest in the equity accounts
of consolidated subsidiaries, and qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In addition, as a general
matter, Tier 1 capital excludes goodwill; amounts of purchased mortgage servicing rights and purchased credit card
relationships that, in the aggregate, exceed 50 percent of Tier 1 capital; amounts of purchased credit card relationships
that exceed 25 percent of Tier 1 capital; all other intangible assets; and deferred tax assets that are dependent upon
future taxable income, net of their valuation allowance, in excess of certain limitations. The Federal Reserve may
exclude certain investments in subsidiaries or associated companies as appropriate.

c. Whenever appropriate, including when a bank is undertaking expansion, seeking to engage in new activities or otherwise
facing unusual or abnormal risks, the Board will continue to consider the level of an individual bank's tangible tier
1 leverage ratio (after deducting all intangibles) in making an overall assessment of capital adequacy. This is consistent
with the Federal Reserve's risk-based capital guidelines an long-standing Board policy and practice with regard
to leverage guidelines. Banks experiencing growth, whether internally or by acquisition, are expected to maintain
strong capital position substantially above minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible
assets.

Deductions of holdings of capital securities also would not be made in the case of interstate ``stake out'' investments
that comply with the Board's Policy Statement on Nonvoting Equity Investments, 12 CFR 225.143 (Federal Reserve Regulatory
Service 4&hyph;172.1; 68 Federal Reserve Bulletin 413 (1982)). In addition, holdings of capital instruments issued
by other banking organizations but taken in satisfaction of debts previously contracted would be exempt from any
deduction from capital. The Board intends to monitor nonreciprocal holdings of other banking organizations' capital
instruments and to provide information on such holdings to the Basle Supervisors' Committee as called for under the
Basle capital framework.

Deferred tax assets.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 The amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, net of the valuation allowance for
deferred tax assets, that may be included in, that is, not deducted from, a banking organization's capital may not
exceed the lesser of: (i) the amount of these deferred tax assets that the banking organization is expected to realize
within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projections of future taxable income for that year,
<FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>
 or (ii) 10 percent of tier 1 capital. For purposes of calculating this limitation, tier 1 capital is defined as the sum
of core capital elements, net of goodwill and all identifiable intangible assets other than purchased mortgage servicing
rights and purchased credit card relationships (and before any disallowed deferred tax assets are deducted). The
amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals
of existing taxable temporary differences generally are not limited. The reported amount of deferred tax assets,
net of any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, in excess of these amounts is to be deducted from a banking organization's
core capital elements in determining tier 1 capital.

Projected future taxable income should not include net operating loss carryforwards to be used during that year or
the amount of existing temporary differences a bank holding company expects to reverse within the year. Such projections
should include the estimated effect of tax planning strategies that the organization expects to implement to realize
net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that will otherwise expire during the year. Banking organizations
may use the future taxable income projections for their current fiscal year (adjusted for any significant changes
that have occurred or are expected to occur) when applying the capital limit at an interim report date rather than preparing
a new projection each quarter. To determine the limit, a banking organization should assume that all existing temporary
differences fully reverse as of the report date.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain Airbus Industrie Model A300, A300&hyph;600, A310, and A320 series airplanes, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requires inspection of certain landing gear brakes for wear and replacement if the wear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits prescribed in this AD are not met, and incorporation of the specified wear limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. This amendment is prompted 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by an accident in which a transport category airplane executed a rejected takeoff (RTO) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and was unable to stop on the runway due to worn brakes; and the subsequent review of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allowable brake wear limits for all transport category airplanes. The actions specified by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this AD are intended to prevent the loss of brake effectiveness during a high energy RTO.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive
(AD) that is applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A300, A300&hyph;600, A310, and A320 series airplanes was
published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 15, 1994 (59 FR 7228). That action proposed to require inspection of certain landing gear brakes for wear
and replacement if the wear limits prescribed in this AD are not met, and incorporation of the specified wear limits
into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration
has been given to the comments received. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter supports the proposed rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter, BFGoodrich, requests that the tables contained in the proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that list maximum brake wear limits for the affected airplanes be revised. BFGoodrich 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates that the airplane model/series listed for BFGoodrich series 2&hyph;1526 brake part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers should be ``A320,'' instead of ``A320&hyph;220'' and ``A320&hyph;200.'' The commenter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also indicates that three additional part numbers for BFGoodrich brakes should be listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the tables for Model A320 series airplanes: Part numbers 2&hyph;1526, 2&hyph;1526&hyph;5 (both with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maximum wear limits of 1.97
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;), and 2&hyph;1572 (with a maximum wear limit of 2.68
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the FAA agrees with the commenter's remarks, inclusion of the three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional part numbers specified by the commenter would necessitate (under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act) reissuing the notice, reopening the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
period for public comment, considering additional comments received, and eventually 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issuing a final rule; the time required for that procedure may be as long as four additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
months. In the interest of issuing this final rule, and in consideration of the amount of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time that has already elapsed since issuance of the original notice, the FAA has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined that further delay of this final rule action is not appropriate. However, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA may consider further rulemaking on this issue to address the three additional part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
numbers discussed by the commenter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
members, suggests that measuring the maximum length of the wear pin may not be as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective as measuring the total length of the wear pin or controlling the carbon thickness 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the brake. The commenter points out that, due to human error, it is possible to have a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thinner disc with the same amount of wear pin length showing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur. The FAA infers from the commenter's remarks that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is referring to controlling the carbon thickness of the brakes by direct measurement of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thickness of the brake stack. The FAA finds that measuring the thickness of the brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stack would only be useful when specifying the brake assembly configuration and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thicknesses of new, refurbished, or overhauled individual discs. Otherwise, a brake disc 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is too thin also could be installed in a brake stack having a wear limit that is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controlled by measuring the stack thickness. Further, it would not be practical to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
routinely measure the brake stack on the airplane as all of the wheels attached to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
brakes would have to be removed to allow access to accomplish the measurement. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FAA considers that this would pose an unwarranted burden on operators. Currently, only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wear pin must be monitored while the brake is installed on the airplane. If an operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduces the wear limit, the pin could be shortened or the operator could devise a method 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of accounting for the reduced wear using the existing wear pin as opposed to removing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wheel and measuring the brake stack. (Thus, the wheels would not have to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
removed from the airplane since the wear pin can still be used to monitor brake wear.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wear limits specified in this AD, which are used to establish wear pin lengths, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are interdependent with the brake configuration and minimum disc and stack thicknesses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The stack and disc thicknesses are specified for new, refurbished, or overhauled brakes in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the airplane maintenance manual (AMM), the component maintenance manual (CMM), a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service bulletin, or the brake manufacturer's assembly drawings. These minimum brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stack and disc thicknesses have been established by tests and in-service wear data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis such that monitoring a wear pin should not allow the stack or disc minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limits to be exceeded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ATA also questions the need for the proposed AD, and requests that a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provision be included in paragraph (a)(2) of the AD to state that the AD would no longer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be applicable to operators that have acceptably revised their maintenance programs, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that operators choosing this provision could use an alternative recordkeeping method in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lieu of that required by &sect;&sect;91.417 or 121.380 of the Federal Aviation Regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(14 CFR 91.417 or 121.380). The FAA would be defined as the cognizant Principal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Maintenance Inspector (PMI) for operators electing this alternative. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The ATA states that if its suggested provision is not included, confusion will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
always exist as to what records should be maintained for the duration A300/A320 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. The ATA maintains that once an operator incorporates the criteria (brake 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wear limits) specified in the proposal into the maintenance program, the AD should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
signed off as complete, since such incorporation is the stated purpose of the AD. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ATA is aware of an FAA concern that the proposed type of rule must continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indefinitely because operators may otherwise escalate intervals through their reliability 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
programs. The ATA states that adjustments to operators' programs are accomplished 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with substantiation and with the approval of FAA Flight Standards District Offices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(FSDO). The ATA maintains that FAA FSDO's have sufficient authority to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operators maintain the brakes on their Model A300/A320 series airplanes once the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed criteria (brake wear limits) have been incorporated into an operator's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
maintenance program.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The FAA does not concur. The intent of this AD is that operators incorporate maximum brake wear limits into the FAA-approved
maintenance inspection program, and that all brakes be inspected once for wear and replaced, if necessary. Once an
operator has complied with the requirements of this AD, the FAA does not intend that operators subsequently record
the accomplishment of this AD each time a brake is inspected or overhauled in accordance with that operator's FAA-approved
maintenance inspection program. ``NOTE 2'' has been added to paragraph (a) of the final rule to clarify this intent.
Operators should coordinate recordkeeping for accomplishment of the actions required by this AD with the cognizant
Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One ATA member requests that carbon brakes be excluded from the applicability of the proposed rule. Airbus adds its
concurrence with the ATA member's request, and has advised the ATA that all carbon brakes installed on airplanes manufactured
by Airbus are capable of sustaining a maximum energy rejected takeoff (RTO) in a 100 percent worn brake configuration.
Airbus also states that no unsafe condition has been identified for airplanes having carbon brakes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Airbus also indicates that issuance of an AD to require implementation of existing CMM limits would impose unnecessary
inspections (with associated costs) and would create an unnecessary paperwork burden on operators. Airbus states
that, if the proposed rule is adopted, then an inspection would be required for all airplanes, not just the 28 airplanes
specified in the economic impact information of the proposal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA does not concur. As discussed in the preamble of the proposal, this AD, as well as other previously issued AD's
to mandate specific maximum brake wear limits on transport category airplanes, was prompted by an accident in 1988
involving worn brakes on a McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplane. During the process of promulgating
those AD's, the FAA became aware that not all operators were following the manufacturer's recommended brake wear
limits. The FAA acknowledges that the wear limits for carbon brakes have not changed. However, the purpose of this
AD is simply to establish the correct brake wear limits for the affected airplanes, including those on which carbon
brakes having unchanged brake wear limits, are installed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA acknowledges that operators of airplanes having carbon brakes will be required to confirm that inspections
are being accomplished and to record compliance with this AD. However, if an operator already operates in accordance
with the wear limits specified in this AD, as implied by ATA and Airbus, then only the costs associated with confirming
compliance with the AD and recording such compliance are necessary. The economic impact information specified below
addresses 46 airplanes that will be required to accomplish the inspection specified in this AD. (This number, 46,
has been revised from the 28 airplanes specified in the proposal; the FAA's latest information is that 46 airplanes
will be affected by the inspection requirement.) However, carbon brakes may be installed on some of those airplanes;
therefore, some of the 46 airplanes addressed in this AD already may be operated in accordance with its provisions.
Therefore, the actual total cost impact of this AD on U.S. operators may be less than the cost reflected in the cost estimate
information, below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter requests that the brake wear limit specified in the proposed rule for brake part numbers 2&hyph;1526&hyph;3
and 2&hyph;1526&hyph;4 should be revised to read 2.68
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; (68 mm), rather than 1.97
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; (50 mm). The commenter indicates that the maximum brake wear limit of 1.97
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; (50 mm) is already standard for brake part numbers 2&hyph;1526&hyph;1 and 2&hyph;1526&hyph;2, whereas
a wear limit of 2.68
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; (68 mm) is specified in the CMM for brake part numbers 2&hyph;1526&hyph;3 and 2&hyph;1526&hyph;4 due to a
different configuration that allows greater wear pin length and still maintains RTO performance at the maximum wear
limit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA finds that no change to the final rule is necessary in this regard. The proposed rule, as published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 on February 15, 1994, specified the correct brake wear limit of 2.68
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo; (68 mm) for brake part numbers 2&hyph;1526&hyph;3 and 2&hyph;1526&hyph;4. That same brake wear limit is
contained in this final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety
and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously described. The FAA has determined
that these changes will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA has recently reviewed the figures it has used over the past several years in calculating the economic impact
of AD activity. In order to account for various inflationary costs in the airline industry, the FAA has determined
that it is necessary to increase the labor rate used in these calculations from $55 per work hour to $60 per work hour.
The economic impact information, below, has been revised to reflect this increase in the specified hourly labor rate.
In addition to the number of affected airplanes of U.S. registry that will be required to accomplish the inspection
(as discussed previously), the FAA has updated the total number of airplanes of U.S. registry and the number of affected
U.S. operators to reflect the latest information available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA estimates that 165 Model A300, A300&hyph;600, A310, and A320 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 7 U.S. operators
will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 20 work hours per operator, at an average labor rate of $60
per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the revision of its FAA-approved maintenance inspection program.
Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that requirement on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,400, or $1,200
per operator. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The FAA also estimates that it will take 15 work hours per airplane, at an average labor rate of $60 per work hour, to accomplish
the required inspection. The cost of required parts to accomplish the change in wear limits for these airplanes (that
is, the cost resulting from the requirement to change the brakes before they are worn to their previously approved
limits for a one-time change) will be approximately $2,236 per airplane. The FAA estimates that 46 of the 165 affected
airplanes of U.S. registry will be required to accomplish the inspection. Based on these figures, the total cost impact
of that requirement on U.S. operators of these airplanes is estimated to be $144,256, or $3,136 per airplane. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no affected operator has accomplished all
of the requirements of this AD action, and that no affected operator would accomplish all of those actions in the future
if this AD were not adopted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between
the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels
of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not
have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive
Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February
26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small
entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action
and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is adopting a policy statement setting forth the elements
of what generally constitutes appropriate ratemaking treatment of sulfur dioxide emissions allowances in coordination
transactions under the Federal Power Act. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, Title IV,
104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990), require issuance of emissions allowances as a means to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions
levels. The Commission also is issuing an interim rule that implements the guidelines set forth in the policy statement.

 requesting issuance of a Policy Statement regarding the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances in coordination
transactions under the Federal Power Act. The acid rain control title (Title IV) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, Pub. L. No. 101&hyph;549, Title IV, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990) (CAAA), provides for the issuance of emissions
allowances as a means to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions levels. EEI proposes that emission allowances be included
in rates at the allowance's incremental cost
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with customers having the choice of two options to compensate the seller of allowances. Either the customer may return,
or transfer, emissions allowances in kind or it may compensate the seller for its incremental cost of emissions allowances.
EEI proposes that the seller be allowed to use a particular price index selected by the seller or an average of several
price indices to determine the current cost to replace an allowance. EEI requests issuance of the Policy Statement
by January 1, 1995, when Phase I of the CAAA becomes effective.

According to EEI, the ``incremental cost'' of an emissions allowance in a coordination sale is the spot market price
at the time of the power sale, as opposed to the inventory value on the company's books.

The Commission agrees with EEI that issuance of a Policy Statement on the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances
in coordination transactions is necessary at this time. The primary goal of the allowance trading program is to encourage
utilities to implement the lowest overall cost actions to comply with the cap on sulfur dioxide emissions contained
in the CAAA. The development of a national and open allowance trading market, the Commission believes, depends in
part upon regulators sending public utilities a clear signal on how allowance trades and CAAA compliance costs will
be treated for ratemaking purposes. Accordingly, the Commission hereby issues a Policy Statement adopting EEI's
proposal, with various modifications discussed below. The Commission also hereby issues an Interim Rule implementing
the guidelines set forth in this Policy Statement.

II. Public Reporting Burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Policy Statement and Interim Rule would clarify how existing filing requirements apply to utilities filing amendments
to coordination rate schedules to provide for the recovery of emissions allowance costs and to recover them in a timely
fashion. Because this Policy Statement and Interim Rule only clarify how existing requirements are to be implemented,
the public reporting burden for these information collections (including the time for reviewing instructions,
searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection
of information) is not estimated to increase the number of hours per response for each utility currently involved
in the filing of rate schedule amendments. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of these
collections of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services
Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415], and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and

The CAAA and Allowance Trading 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The acid rain control title of the CAAA sets forth a comprehensive regulatory mechanism designed to control acid rain
by limiting sulfur dioxide emissions by electric utilities. The CAAA require reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions
in two phases. Phase I begins on January 1, 1995, and applies to 110 mostly coal-fired utility plants containing about
260 generating units specifically listed in the statute. These plants are owned by about 40 jurisdictional utility
systems that are expected to reduce annual sulfur dioxide emissions by as much as 4.5 million tons. Phase II begins
on January 1, 2000, and applies to virtually all existing steam-electric generating utility units with capacity
exceeding 25 megawatts and to new generating utility units (generally those commencing operation after November
15, 1990) of any size. Phase II permanently caps sulfur dioxide emissions at 9 million tons annually. The Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) issues to the owners of generating units allowances (defined as an authorization to emit,
during or after a specified calendar year, one ton of sulfur dioxide)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 equal to the number of tons of sulfur dioxide emissions authorized by the CAAA. EPA does not assess a charge for the allowances
it awards. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The allowances are not unit-specific and can be sold or traded. Utilities have incentives to reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions so that they can use allowances to cover load growth, to make additional off-system sales or to sell or trade
allowances on the open market, offsetting the costs of compliance. Utilities that reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide
emitted below their authorized level (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, by switching to a lower sulfur coal, switching to a new fuel, installing scrubbers, repowering a unit, or using demand
side management (DSM)) may bank their allowances (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, hold and use them in another year) or sell or trade them to other utilities that expect to exceed their authorized emission
level or other allowance market participants such as marketers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress created the allowance trading system in Title IV of the CAAA to enable sulfur dioxide emissions reductions
to occur at the lowest cost, by creating a national market for emissions allowances. Basically, the emissions allowance
trading system works in the following manner. Title IV of the CAAA established guidelines for the EPA to implement
a system for issuing, recording and tracking allowances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Allowance usage at each affected unit is recorded by EPA quarterly. There is a national cap on the total number of allowances
issued by EPA each year.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
7
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 After the end of each year, EPA determines whether companies have the right number of emissions allowances of appropriate
vintage on hand for each ton of sulfur dioxide emitted during the year. The penalty for not having the requisite number
of allowances on hand is $2,000 per ton plus surrender of an emissions allowance equivalent in the following year,
plus other possible punishments depending on the degree of violation.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
8
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The CAAA also require EPA to withhold for direct sale and auction 2.8 percent of the annual allowance allocations.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

9
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, Order No. 552, III FERC Statutes and Regulations, Regulations Preambles &para;30,967, 58 FR 17982 (April 7, 1993),
the Commission amended its Uniform Systems of Accounts for public utilities, licensees and natural gas companies
to establish uniform accounting requirements for allowances for the emission of sulfur dioxide under the CAAA, and
to establish generic accounts to record assets and liabilities created through the ratemaking actions of regulatory
agencies. While acknowledging the need for the eventual development of a ratemaking framework for allowances, the
Commission declined to expand the scope of the accounting rule to address rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
issues.

The Commission stated that the accounting rules were intended to be ``rate neutral,''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
they were not intended to prescribe ratemaking treatment for allowances and would not bar regulatory commissions
(including this Commission) from adopting any particular ratemaking treatment. The Commission observed that the
bulk of the cost of allowances and compliance will be within the ratemaking jurisdiction of the various States and
not this Commission, and found that there was not likely to be a single ratemaking framework appropriate in each and
every ratemaking jurisdiction for utilities subject to this Commission's accounting jurisdiction. III FERC Statutes

is urgently needed in view of the imminent onset of Phase I. EEI states that the allowance market is rapidly evolving,

EEI Petition, Appendix A.

</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EEI requests the Commission to: (1) Provide for costing emissions allowances at their incremental cost in coordination
rates, determined on the basis of a leading index or combination of indices of the current price of emissions allowances,
such index or combination of indices to be selected by the seller of the power; (2) compensate coordination sellers
by permitting power purchasers at their option either: (a) To transfer or return emission allowances in kind
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
14
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or (b) compensate the seller for its incremental cost of emission allowances, and (c) declare that purchasers who
provide emissions allowances do not need to make filings with the Commission; (3) find that the cost of emissions allowances
may be recovered under provisions in coordination rate schedules as ``out-of-pocket'' costs; (4) give utilities
up to 45 days after the Commission issues a policy statement to file amendments to rate schedules to allow recovery
of emissions allowance costs beginning January 1, 1995, provided that each utility gives its customers notice of
the emission allowance recovery methodology it will be using when energy is scheduled (the Commission would reserve
the ability, as a condition of making the policy effective January 1, 1995, to order refunds); (5) clarify that the
transfer of emission allowances is not subject to a Section 205 filing and determine that sales of emissions allowances
are not jurisdictional under Section 203 or 205 of the FPA;
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
15
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and (6) declare that the ratemaking treatment of emissions allowances endorsed in this Policy Statement does not
preclude other approaches proposed by individual utilities on a case-by-case basis.

EEI argues that such option will: (a) Allow a power purchaser to optimize its economic position if it can purchase allowances
at a price below the seller's declared price; (b) prevent a seller from dictating the allowance price; (c) reward a
power purchaser who seeks the lowest cost emissions allowances; and (d) promote an active allowance market that enhances
the savings in compliance costs envisioned by the CAAA and also promotes the FPA's purpose to provide for reasonable
rates. None of the intervenors and commenters oppose this proposal.

In particular, EEI asks the Commission to find that emissions allowances are not ``facilities'' under Section 203,
and, therefore, the sale or transfer of such allowances does not require the Commission's authorization. We address
EEI's request for a jurisdictional determination in a separate order.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EEI notes that use of incremental costs as a basis for emission allowance costing is consistent with the cost basis
used for other variable expenses (

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

existing rate schedules that include specific provisions allowing the tracking of incremental costs.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

be required to supplement their rate schedules with specific details regarding the recovery of the incremental cost
of emissions allowances in their rates.

EEI does not explain what procedure would be followed by utilities that have coordination rates on file that do not
expressly provide for the recovery of all incremental costs, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
a coordination rate schedule that provides for recovery of incremental fuel, but is silent with respect to other types
of variable costs; coordination rate schedules that include stated rates; or coordination rate schedules that do
not adopt incremental cost pricing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Since there may be different ways of determining the incremental cost of emissions allowances, EEI proposes that
utilities be required to submit the following company-specific details. First, EEI suggests that utilities should
be required to choose a leading national index or combination of indices to determine the incremental cost of emission
allowances at the time of the allowance's consumption and be required to use that index until they identify some other
acceptable index in a filing with the Commission. Second, EEI suggests that each utility be required to explain the
method of calculating its emission allowance dispatch value. EEI indicates that the use of incremental costing for
emissions allowances should be consistent with the use of incremental costing for economic dispatch decisions.
EEI proposes that any differences between the incremental costing for coordination sales of emissions allowances
and dispatch decisions regarding emissions allowances be explained and reconciled. Third, EEI suggests that utilities
be required to explain how they will quantify the amount of emission allowances attributable to each transaction.
Fourth, EEI suggests that, with respect to longer-term transactions, utilities be required to specify the timing
of opportunities for buyers to stipulate whether they will purchase or provide the emissions allowances.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
18
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Fifth, EEI suggests that utilities be required to identify any other factors that could impact pricing, such as rates
tied to units other than the incremental unit used for the sale. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
While EEI's argument on this point is unclear, we believe EEI's position is that, for longer-term transactions, buyers
of emissions allowances should have the same timing opportunities as allowance sellers. Because sellers do not have
to have the required emissions allowances until January 30 of the year subsequent to the calendar year, or the first
business day subsequent to January 30 if January 30 is not a business day (hereinafter EPA reporting date), 40 CFR 72.2
and 73.35(a)(2) (1994), they are able to delay purchasing allowances in order to possibly obtain a less expensive
allowance price. By providing flexibility as to the time within which buyers can transfer allowances, buyers might
be able to save money as well.

Positions of Intervenors and Commenters
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
CG&amp;E, PSI, Entergy Services, IPAA and Cleveland take no position on the merits of EEI's proposal. The Washington
Commission, the Indiana Commission, PEPCO, and Southern generally express support for the proposal. The remainder
of the intervenors and commenters indicate concerns with various aspects of the proposal, as discussed below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The California Commission supports EEI's request that alternative proposals for emissions allowance ratemaking
treatment not be precluded and that such proposals be considered on a case-by-case basis.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA supports EEI's request for incremental pricing for allowances and use of an index to establish the incremental
price. However, EPA requests the Commission to address ratemaking for all wholesale transactions at this time. EPA
also seeks a uniform approach for costing and rate treatment of allowances. Thus, EPA requests that the Commission
adopt one index option for use by all public utilities. EPA suggests that its auction presently provides the most reliable
price index. EPA also raises concerns about EEI's proposal to allow alternate ratemaking proposals on a case-by-case
basis. EPA states that utilities should bear the burden of showing that any different approach is justified and will
not result in an unfair competitive advantage in electric power markets. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Emissions Exchange, Clean Air and Cantor Fitzgerald state that EPA auction prices have consistently been artificially
low and that the EPA auction price is not representative of the open market because the auction is held just once a year
and does not track the current price and availability of allowances. Emissions Exchange asks that the Commission
refrain from dictating use of any particular price index. Instead, Emissions Exchange proposes that this Commission
permit each utility to choose its market price index from a list which includes, but is not limited to, the allowance
price indicators published by Cantor Fitzgerald.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the problems it sees with the EPA auction, Clean Air maintains that commercial bulletin board services
are also unreliable sources for allowance price information. It argues that bulletin board bid/ask prices may not
reflect actual allowance transactions and could subject market participants to inaccurate price signals, gaming
and manipulation. Clean Air opposes allowing the selling utility to cost emissions allowances at a market index of
its own choosing because this presents the danger of the selling utility picking a price based on the highest-cost
index, with no demonstration that this price reflects the realities of the market. Clean Air also opposes the selection
of a single index by the Commission, stating that the Commission would risk sending misleading price signals. Clean
Air suggests that, in addition to requiring sellers of allowances to inform buyers of the price of allowances and the
number of allowances to be provided, the seller should notify the buyer that there is a third party who will provide
the allowances at a stated price. Clean Air also proposes that the Commission require sellers to report the volume
of allowances transferred, their price and the name of any third parties supplying the allowances. Clean Air states

The Consumers' Counsel and Tellus state that this Commission should expand the scope of this proceeding to include
the ratemaking treatment of allowances for all wholesale transactions. The Consumers' Counsel also states that
it would be more efficient for a policy statement to recognize other valuation methods in addition to incremental
costs, such as a cost-of-compliance approach, and to specify when that method would be more appropriate.

for allowances and should develop a standard method of allocation of EPA-granted allowances between wholesale and
retail customers and between affiliates.

Wisconsin Electric argues that EEI's pricing policy is contrary to the CAAA because it will cause generation to shift
from Phase I units to non-Phase I units. This is because a requirement that utilities charge the full incremental cost
of allowances will result in an increase in the operating cost of Phase I units and result in those units being underutilized.
It is possible, Wisconsin Electric argues, that if a Phase I unit is not utilized at ``baseline'' (1985&hyph;1987)
levels, the utility may be required by the CAAA to forfeit allowances.

 For these reasons, Wisconsin Electric suggests, the Commission, in its Policy Statement, should allow utilities
with Phase I units the flexibility to charge ``up to'' the incremental cost of a Phase I allowance. Wisconsin Electric
argues that achieving least cost dispatch, in light of complexities such as reduced utilization of Phase I units,
may require use of a dispatch emissions value that differs from incremental cost.

According to Wisconsin Electric, it cannot be assumed that an allowance on a Phase I unit that is underutilized (thereby
subjecting the allowance to possible surrender under the CAAA) has an opportunity cost equal to incremental costs
since an allowance that is surrendered may not be consumed or traded by the utility.

APPA argues that the proposed policy statement would grant excessive discretion to utilities and would open the door
to inconsistent ratemaking treatment. APPA complains that EEI's proposal contains no clear requirement that the
selling utility be consistent in its ratemaking treatment on simultaneous transactions and does not require a utility
to adhere to any particular methodology once adopted. Further, APPA argues, EEI's petition does not define how the
revenues from emissions allowances included in rates will be credited to various customer classes. Moreover, APPA
argues, EEI's proposal that this Commission allow utilities with existing incremental cost rate provisions to file
emission allowance pricing information without revising their rate schedules will authorize utilities to redefine
contract terms unilaterally. APPA contends that EEI's proposal does not clearly define the scope of transactions
to which the Policy Statement will apply. APPA maintains that the Commission should afford affected parties the opportunity
to challenge application of whatever policy is adopted in this Policy Statement on a case-by-case basis. APPA also
believes that this Commission should establish a standard market price for allowances or provide a forum for review
to ensure the justness and reasonableness of indices or methodologies to be used by a selling utility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Tellus also states that since several utilities recently have filed differing proposals for emissions allowance
cost recovery in affiliated transactions, this Commission must act promptly to establish generic ratemaking policies
for each type of wholesale arrangement. Tellus further urges the Commission, either in this or in a separate proceeding,
to address the ratemaking treatment of costs of compliance with the CAAA, in addition to allowance costs. Tellus suggests
that this Commission establish its own monthly market index price for emissions allowances, determine how the profits
should be credited to and among wholesale and retail customers, develop a standard method for allocating allowances
obtained from EPA at no cost between wholesale and retail customers, and establish generic policies regarding the
adequacy and appropriateness of current wholesale rate designs for passing CAAA costs through to wholesale customers.
Tellus suggests that average inventory costs might be a valid basis for determining the cost of emissions allowances.

EEI, in reply, again urges issuance of a policy statement by January 1, 1995. EEI argues that the policy guidance requested
is appropriately limited to coordination transactions. EEI argues that coordination transactions are a distinct
category of voluntary transactions and that the treatment it proposes is consistent with Commission precedent for
other out-of-pocket costs incurred in such transactions. EEI submits that the guidance it requests here, while appropriate
for coordination transactions, cannot accommodate the varying circumstances and cost allocation issues involved
in wholesale requirements service or transactions among affiliated companies. EEI also notes, in reply, that the
Commission, in Regulation of Electricity Sales for Resale and Transmission Service, Notice of Inquiry, IV FERC Stats.
and Regs. &para;35,518 at 35,628 (1985), order terminating docket, 61 FERC &para;61,371 (1992), defined the term

The Commission therein defined coordination transactions as ``sales or exchanges of specialized electricity services
that allow buyers to realize cost savings or reliability gains that are not attainable if they rely solely on their
own resources. For sellers, these transactions provide opportunities to earn additional revenue, and to lower customer
rates, from capacity that is temporarily in excess to native load capacity requirements. Transactions are voluntary
and the seller's obligation is limited.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requirements service was defined as ``a long-term supply of firm power to meet all or part of the buyer's load requirements,
including load-growth. Sellers undertake a relatively open-ended commitment to provide service. Utilities must
plan and build generation and transmission capacity to meet this commitment. From the seller's perspective, requirements
service is essentially the same as retail service with the primary difference being that delivery is typically made
at transmission voltages. Requirements customers are considered part of the seller's native load. Buyers are typically
municipally or cooperatively owned distributors that resell the power to end-use customers.''

EEI opposes case-by-case treatment of rate recovery of emissions allowances in coordination transactions. It argues
that a case-by-case approach would unduly burden the Commission with hundreds of virtually identical proceedings
that can be more efficiently addressed through the policy statement approach it advocates here. EEI maintains that
it is not seeking to expand the meaning of defined contract terms, but simply to include in existing contract terms
costs that are reasonable and contractually permissible. EEI recognizes the need for special treatment of generating
units subject to the requirements of reduced utilization in the CAAA, and that exceptions to the use of the full incremental
costs of emissions allowances associated with those generating units may take place. However, EEI believes that
its proposal adequately responds to Wisconsin Electric's concerns in this area because it allows exceptions to full
incremental costs as long as dispatch criteria and the coordination rates are consistent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EEI further states that the Commission should not designate any specific index because such action would hinder market
competition in allowance trading. It characterizes as unnecessary and burdensome Clean Air's proposals that energy
sellers certify an unaffiliated third party to provide allowances to a power purchaser, and that utilities be required
to report the volume and price of allowance trades for publication by this Commission. Finally, EEI argues that this
is not the appropriate proceeding to specify particular revenue credit treatment of allowance-related revenues.
EEI submits that revenue credits with respect to coordination transactions are specified either in agreements between
retail and wholesale customer groups and utility companies or are required under the retail and wholesale practices
of state commissions or this Commission. Thus, EEI argues, revenue credits are appropriately dealt with in rate cases,
rather than in a policy proceeding.

Use of Incremental Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We will allow the recovery of incremental costs of emission allowances in coordination rates whenever the coordination
rate also provides for recovery of other variable costs on an incremental basis. EEI's proposal that the incremental
cost of emissions allowances be recovered in coordination rates will ensure, under many coordination rate schedules,
consistency with the way in which other costs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, fuel) are recovered and with dispatch decisions. In response to APPA's concern that the scope of the transactions
affected by the Policy Statement is not clearly defined in EEI's proposal, the Commission wishes to make clear that
the policy adopted here will apply only when a coordination rate expressly provides for the recovery of incremental
costs or if stated rates are designed to recover incremental costs. If a coordination rate does not reflect incremental
cost pricing for other costs (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, coordination transactions that are designed as unit sales where the rates track the costs of a particular unit or
coordination rates that are designed to recover average costs), the Commission will require the seller to propose
an alternative costing method for emissions allowances, or demonstrate that any inconsistency between the proposed
costing method and the coordination rate does not produce unreasonable results. The Commission finds that the cost
to replace an allowance is an appropriate basis to establish incremental cost.

Use of Indices

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We will adopt EEI's proposal that sellers be permitted to choose their own index or a combination of indices. Because
the emission allowance markets are still developing, the Commission cannot, at this time, conclude that any particular
index should be utilized. Our primary concern in allowing the selling utility to choose the index or indices is that,
if there are variations in the available indices, the seller will select the one with the highest price at the time of
the transaction, rather than the index that best reflects the incremental cost. EEI's proposal guards against this
practice because it provides the customer with the option to supply its own allowances rather than purchase allowances
from a selling utility.

Dispatch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EEI's proposal is based on sellers' use of the same index for pricing coordination sales and making dispatch decisions.
If the seller does not use the same index for both purposes, EEI proposes that the seller be required to reconcile the
differences. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission will adopt this proposal. The purpose of any dispatch criterion is to meet each increment of load from
the increment of generation with the lowest running costs (fuel, other variable operating expenses and, now, emissions
allowances). If the seller is not using the same cost index in its dispatch decisions as it is proposing for pricing
its coordination sales, we cannot rely upon the index to reflect incremental cost.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Calculation of Amount of Emissions Allowances Associated With a Transaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will also adopt EEI's proposal that sellers explain how they will compute the amount of emissions allowances
that will be attributed to each coordination transaction. The amount of emissions allowances related to a coordination
sale will vary based on the unit used for pricing, the amount of energy generated and the type of fuel used. The Commission
expects that the generating unit used to compute the emission allowance amount would be the same unit that is used to
price the incremental fuel component of the coordination rate. Also, the seller should explain how fractional amounts
will be handled. While a customer choosing the cash compensation method could pay for part of an allowance, the customer
cannot choose to return part of an allowance. To resolve this problem, utilities could adopt a ``rounding'' approach,

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, rounding up to the next whole number if the fraction is greater than one half, or down if the fraction is less than one-half.
If a rounding approach is used for the return of allowances in kind, it should also be used for cash settlements so that
there is no bias for or against the return in kind option.

Timing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission also adopts EEI's proposal that utilities provide details on the timing of opportunities to return
allowances or stipulate whether they will purchase or return allowances. Customers should be able to take advantage
of possible cost savings resulting from the timing of allowance settlements.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
32
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 This can be accomplished by allowing customers that choose to provide allowances in kind to do so by the appropriate
EPA reporting date
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
33
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a ``timing option.'' Thus, allowance customers will have the same opportunities as allowance sellers and face the
same consequences, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

This issue is significant because utilities in effect settle their allowance position with EPA at the EPA reporting
date and the cost of obtaining an allowance may be different at that time than it is at the time that the transaction occurs.
Indeed, there may be significant differences in allowance costs at different times of the year.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission adopts EEI's proposal that sellers specify any other factors that may affect pricing. For example,
many utilities have coordination rates that allow a reservation charge based on a unit other than the unit used to generate
energy as long as the total revenues do not exceed the fixed and variable costs of the unit used for pricing.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
35
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Utilities which operate under this type of ceiling will have to clarify that the variable cost component includes
the emissions allowance amount associated with the unit used to establish the ceiling.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
An example is Indiana Michigan Power Company's coordination rate schedule, supra n.16, which consist of an energy
charge based on system incremental fuel and operating costs and a reservation charge based on the cost of its Rockport
generating unit. Because Indiana Michigan has negotiated favorable coal contracts for the Rockport unit, that unit
is not likely to be available for coordination sales. As a result, there is an inconsistency between Indiana Michigan's
demand charge (based on its Rockport unit) and its energy charge (based on system incremental fuel cost which is higher
than Rockport's fuel cost). To conform this rate to the Commission's requirement that energy and demand charges be
designed on a consistent basis, the rate is subject to a ceiling reflecting the fixed and variable costs of the Rockport
unit.

Other Rate Issues Raised by Intervenors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will not expand the scope of this Policy Statement beyond what EEI has proposed. The ratemaking treatment
for coordination, requirements and affiliated pooling arrangements must recognize the differences in the character
of the service arrangements. Furthermore, the timing of any ratemaking implementation will, of necessity, be different.
For instance, because in requirements service the cost of emissions allowances will be a very small percentage of
a utility's overall costs, a utility may choose not to address emissions allowance costs in requirements rates until
it files its next general rate case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also, since requirements customers typically pay a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
pro rata 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
share of all of a utility's prudently incurred costs and utilities may choose various methods to comply with the CAAA,
it would be difficult, if not impossible, to establish a generic policy that would be appropriate for all requirements
service. Likewise, since operating agreements between affiliate utilities are not uniform, it would be difficult
to establish a generic ratemaking policy for affiliated pooling arrangements. Affiliate agreements also may reflect
compromises to satisfy the concerns of state regulators.

Conversely, the pricing of coordination transactions is fairly standardized, generally reflecting an energy charge
equal to incremental costs and a reservation charge providing a contribution to the fixed costs of the units used to
price the energy. Thus, the treatment of emissions allowances in coordination rates can be readily addressed in a
generic fashion. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with Florida Power's request, we state that Phase II utilities are not now required to make rate filings
detailing their emission allowance treatment for coordination transactions that will not be affected until the
year 2000. Such filings would be due no more than 120 or less than 60 days prior to Phase II. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The intervenors have raised concerns regarding the crediting of allowance related revenues to requirements rates
or the allocation of emissions allowances between retail and wholesale requirements jurisdictions. It will be our
policy to treat the revenues from allowances sold as part of coordination sales the same way we treat other revenues
from coordination sales. In other words, to the extent, and in the same way that, the latter revenues are credited to
jurisdictional customers, so should the former revenues. However, we will address implementation of this policy
in the context of individual requirements rate proceedings, or, if appropriate, complaint proceedings. In section
205 proceedings, utilities will be expected to fully support their test year projections for emission allowances
associated with coordination sales. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We reject Clean Air's requests that the Commission require sellers to report the volume and price of allowances transferred
and publish this information, and that sellers certify unaffiliated third parties to provide allowances to a customer.
Sellers must, of course, be prepared to document the calculation of all aspects of their rates, including the emissions
allowance component. However, an extensive reporting requirement and third-party certification would be costly
and time consuming, and there is no basis to conclude that imposition of this burden on utilities would enhance the
development of the emission allowance trading markets.

Finally, the Commission notes that this Policy Statement contains general guidelines on ratemaking treatment in
coordination rates for the cost of emissions allowances. It is not intended to preclude utilities or other interested
parties, such as state commissions, from proposing alternate rate treatments for consideration on a case-by-case
basis.

Florida Power requests that the Policy Statement not prejudge every contractual relationship. Florida Power is
primarily concerned about its existing arrangements with Southern Companies which are at issue in Docket No. ER95&hyph;59&hyph;000.
This Policy Statement will not preclude Florida Power from proposing different treatments with respect to those
arrangements at issue in Docket No. ER95&hyph;59&hyph;000.

APPA is concerned about the lack of specifics concerning possible alternatives to EEI's proposal. However, we will
not address alternate proposals in this Policy Statement, other than to state that they are permitted to be presented
to the Commission and will be considered on a case-by-case basis. The Commission will ensure that any alternate proposal
adopted is just and reasonable, and in so doing will consider fully the concerns of affected parties who intervene
in individual rate proceedings, abbreviated or otherwise, involving emissions allowances.

V. Implementation Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the Interim Rule accompanying the Policy Statement, the Commission also adopts EEI's proposal that if utilities
have rate schedules on file that expressly provide for the recovery of all incremental or out-of-pocket costs, these
utilities should be allowed to make abbreviated rate filings, limited to detailing how they would recover emissions
allowance costs. These filings should include the following: the index or combination of indices to be used, the method
by which the emission allowance amounts will be calculated, timing procedures, how inconsistencies, if any, with
dispatch criteria will be reconciled, and how any other rate impacts will be addressed. These filings would constitute
rate schedule amendments under FPA section 205 since they would describe how the rates are computed. Utilities making
such abbreviated filings should: (1) clearly identify the filing as being limited to amendments to coordination
rates to reflect the costs of emissions allowances, in the first paragraph of the letter of transmittal accompanying
the filing, (2) submit a document that can be inserted into each rate schedule and (3) identify each rate schedule to
which the amendment applies. Finally, the abbreviated filing should apply consistent treatment to all coordination
rate schedules or the filing utility should justify its failure to do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regarding coordination rates that do not provide for the recovery of all incremental costs,
<FOOTCITE>38</FOOTCITE>
 we conclude that the seller may include rate schedule amendments together with the abbreviated filing discussed
above if the customer agrees to the rate change. If the customer does not agree to revise such rates, the utility should
tender its emission allowance proposal in a separate section 205 rate filing, fully justifying its proposal. This
will ensure that the processing of uncontested rate filings is not delayed by disputes over individual agreements.

Some coordination rates provide only for the recovery of incremental fuel costs, and contain no provisions for recovery
of other incremental costs. Also, some coordination transactions, while premised upon incremental costs, take
place under stated rates.

would be noticed and customers provided an opportunity to comment.

45-Day Amendment Period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission adopts EEI's proposal that utilities be allowed to implement the policy announced herein on January
1, 1995, but make the filings discussed above within 45 days after the Commission issues an order in this proceeding.
In return for granting waiver of notice, the utilities must agree that revenues will be collected subject to refund
pending Commission action. Utilities making such filings should include a statement in the first paragraph of their
transmittal letter agreeing to the refund condition with respect to allowance-related charges assessed between
January 1, 1995, and the date the Commission issues an order accepting the filing without investigation or hearing.

VI. Information Collection Statement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) regulations at 5 CFR 1320.13 require that OMB approve certain information
and recordkeeping requirements imposed by an agency. The information collection requirements in this policy statement
are contained in FERC&hyph;516 ``Electric Rate Schedule Filings'' (1902&hyph;0096). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is issuing this Policy Statement and Interim Rule with the information requirements to carry out its
regulatory responsibilities under the Federal Power Act to determine the appropriate ratemaking treatment of sulfur
dioxide emissions allowances in coordination transactions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Policy Statement and Interim Rule provide guidance to public utilities on the ratemaking treatment of emissions
allowances in coordination transactions in order that the CAAA emissions allowance program will be implemented
in accordance with the Congressional mandate. The Commission's Office of Electric Power Regulation uses the data
for determination for the reasonableness and justness of costs for emissions allowances when a public utility seeks
to pass through its costs in wholesale rates. These collections of information are intended to be the minimum elements
needed for utilities to file amendments to their rate schedules. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is submitting to the Office of Management and Budget a notification of these proposed collections
of information. Interested persons may obtain information on these reporting requirements by contacting the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE, Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information
Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415]. Comments on the requirements of this rule can be sent to the Office of Information
and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Washington, D.C. 20503, (Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission)

The Commission invites interested persons to submit additional written comments on the matters addressed in this
Interim Rule. An original and 14 copies of the comments must be filed with the Commission no later than January 23, 1995.
Comments should be submitted to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol
Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, and should refer to Docket No. PL95&hyph;1&hyph;000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All other written comments will be placed in the Commission's public files and will be available for public inspection
in the Commission's Public Reference Room at 941 North Capitol Street, N.E. Washington, D.C. 20426, during regular
business hours.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Policy Statement and Interim Rule are effective January 1, 1995. Because Phase I of the CAAA begins January 1,
1995, public utilities subject to the Commission's jurisdiction need to have in place as of that date a method of recovery
in rates of the cost of emissions allowances used in coordination transactions. For that reason the Commission finds
good cause to make the Interim Rule effective without prior notice and comment, and finds good cause to make the Interim
Rule effective on less than 30 days' notice.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
General Policy. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This Statement of Policy is adopted in furtherance of the goals of Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub.
L. 101&hyph;549, Title IV, 104 Stat. 2399, 2584 (1990).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Costing Emissions Allowances in Coordination Sales. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a public utility's coordination rate on file with the Commission provides for recovery of variable costs on an incremental
basis, the Commission will allow recovery of the incremental costs of emissions allowances associated with a coordination
sale. If a coordination rate does not reflect incremental costs, the public utility should propose alternative allowance
costing methods or demonstrate that the coordination rate does not produce unreasonable results. The Commission
finds that the cost to replace an allowance is an appropriate basis to establish the incremental cost. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Use of Indices. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Commission will allow public utilities to determine emissions allowance costs on the basis of an index or combination
of indices of the current price of emissions allowances, provided that the public utility affords purchasing utilities
the option of providing emissions allowances. Public utilities should explain and justify any use of different incremental
cost indices for pricing coordination sales and making dispatch decisions.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(1) If a public utility has a coordination rate schedule on file that expressly provides for the recovery of all incremental
or out-of-pocket costs, such utility may make an abbreviated rate filing detailing how it will recover emissions
allowance costs. Such filing must include the following: the index or combination of indices to be used; the method
by which the emission allowance amounts will be calculated; timing procedures; how inconsistencies, if any, with
dispatch criteria will be reconciled; and how any other rate impacts will be addressed. In addition, a utility making
an abbreviated filing must:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) clearly identify the filing as being limited to an amendment to a coordination rate to reflect the cost of emissions
allowances, in the first paragraph of the letter of transmittal accompanying the filing;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) submit revised pages that can be inserted into each rate schedule; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) identify each rate schedule to which the amendment applies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The abbreviated filing must apply consistent treatment to all coordination rate schedules. If the filing does
not apply consistent rate treatment, the public utility must explain why it does not do so. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If a public utility wants to charge incremental costs for emissions allowances, but its rate schedule on file with
the Commission does not provide for the recovery of all incremental costs, the selling public utility may submit an
abbreviated filing if all customers agree to the rate change. If customers do not agree, the selling public utility
must tender its emissions allowance proposal in a separate section 205 rate filing, fully justifying its proposal.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing a final rule that revoked the generally recognized as safe (GRAS)
listing of sulfiting agents (i.e., sulfur dioxide, sodium sulfite, sodium and potassium bisulfite, and sodium and
potassium metabisulfite) on ``fresh'' potatoes that are intended to be served or sold unpackaged and unlabeled to
the consumer. The agency is revising its regulations in accordance with the withdrawal. This action is being taken
in response to a court ruling.

 December 22, 1994. Insofar as it prohibits the use of sulfiting agents on ``fresh'' potatoes that are intended to be
served or sold unpackaged and unlabeled to consumers, the final rule being withdrawn has been null and void since a
court ruling to that effect on August 3, 1990.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 15, 1990 (55 FR 9826), FDA published a final rule that amended the GRAS regulations to revoke GRAS status for
the use of sulfiting agents on ``fresh'' potatoes. The rule was challenged by the ``fresh'' potato industry and invalidated
by the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on procedural grounds; subsequently, the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, sitting en banc, i.e., the full court, heard the case and, by an equally divided
vote, let the district court's decision stand. In accordance with the court's ruling, the agency is withdrawing the
revocation of GRAS status for the use of sulfiting agents on ``fresh'' potatoes and is revising 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;&sect;182.3616, 182.3637, 182.3739, 182.3766, 182.3798, and 182.3862 (21 U.S.C. 182.3616, 182.3637, 182.3639,

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because the issuance of this document is in response to a court order, FDA finds that providing notice and public comment
prior to the publication of this final rule is unnecessary and may therefore be dispensed with for good cause under
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B). Therefore, publication of this rule withdrawing the revocation of GRAS status for use of sulfiting
agents on ``fresh'' potatoes constitutes final action. The agency advises, however, that it has continuing concerns
about the safety of this use of sulfiting agents and is considering further action.

 This document contains temporary regulations relating to the income tax withholding requirement on distributions
of profits from certain gaming activities made to members of Indian tribes under section 3402(r) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986. The regulations reflect changes to the law made by section 701 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. Those
affected by the regulations are persons, including Indian tribes, making payments to members of Indian tribes from
net revenues of certain gaming activities conducted or licensed by the tribes. Also affected are members of Indian
tribes who receive the payments. The text of these temporary regulations also serves as the text of the proposed regulations
set forth in the notice of proposed rulemaking on this subject in the Proposed Rules section of this issue of the

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This document contains amendments to the Employment Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 31) under section 3402(r). Section
3402(r) was added by section 701 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, which approved the trade agreements resulting
from the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT) and the Statement of Administrative Action to implement the Agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3402(r) requires that persons, including Indian tribes, making payments to members of Indian tribes from
the net revenues of certain gaming activities conducted or licensed by the tribes deduct and withhold income taxes
from those payments. These regulations provide guidance on how to comply with the new withholding requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Explanation of Provisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Net revenue from certain gaming activities conducted or licensed by an Indian tribe may be used to make taxable distributions
to members of the Indian tribe. The tribe must notify its members of the tax liability at the time the payments are made.
25 U.S.C. 2710(b)(3) and (d)(1). Under prior law, the tribe was not required to withhold on such payments except to
the extent backup withholding rules applied under section 3406. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distributions of net revenues from gaming activity by an Indian tribe may result in significant tax liability to the
tribe's members. Withholding on such payments is intended to approximate ultimate tax liability. For some tribal
members, this withholding may eliminate the need to make quarterly estimated tax payments. For others, it will reduce
the likelihood that they will face penalties for underpayment of tax. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3402(r) generally requires that, for payments made after December 31, 1994, persons, including Indian tribes,
making payments to members of Indian tribes from the net revenues of certain gaming activities conducted or licensed
by the tribes deduct and withhold income taxes from those payments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This regulation provides for the amounts to be withheld to be determined under the applicable table. Upon publication
of this regulation, the IRS will make available tables for withholding on distributions to tribal members in 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3402(r)(5) requires that payments be placed on an annualized basis under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.
While these regulations provide a method for placing payments on an annualized basis, it will ordinarily not be necessary
to annualize the payments, because the tables provided by the IRS reflect the annualized payment in prescribing the
amount to be withheld. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3402(r)(6) provides that, at the election of an Indian tribe, the tax imposed by section 3402(r) on any payment
made by such tribe shall be determined in accordance with such tables or computational procedures as may be specified
in regulations. This regulation allows withholding under section 3402(r) pursuant to any tables or procedures,
provided that the amount of tax withheld is substantially the same as it would be using the tables provided by the IRS
pursuant to section 3402(r). No written election is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3402(p)(2) authorizes the Secretary to provide in regulations for withholding from payments other than
wages if the person making the payment and the person receiving the payment agree to the withholding. This regulation
provides that additional withholding is permitted where a tribal member and a tribe enter into a voluntary withholding
agreement.

Special Analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore,
a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure
Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations,
and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue
Code, these temporary regulations will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration
for comment on their impact on small business.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a)(1) General rule. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3402(r)(1) requires every person, including an Indian tribe, making a payment to a member of an Indian tribe
from the net revenues of any class II or class III gaming activity, as defined in 25 U.S.C. 2703, conducted or licensed
by such tribe to deduct and withhold from such payment a tax in an amount equal to such payment's proportionate share
of the annualized tax, as that term is defined in section 3402(r)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Withholding tables. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the amount of a payment's proportionate share of the annualized
tax shall be determined under the applicable table provided by the Commissioner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Annualized amount of payment. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 3402(r)(5) provides that payments shall be placed on an annualized basis under regulations prescribed by
the Secretary. A payment may be placed on an annualized basis by multiplying the amount of the payment by the total number
of payments to be made in a calendar year. For example, a monthly payment may be annualized by multiplying the amount
of the payment by 12. Similarly, a quarterly payment may be annualized by multiplying the amount of the payment by 4.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
In general. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Any procedure for determining the amount to be deducted and withheld under section 3402(r) may be used, provided that
the amount of tax deducted and withheld is substantially the same as it would be using the tables provided by the Commissioner
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section. At the election of an Indian tribe, the tax imposed by section 3402(r) shall
be determined in accordance with this alternate procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Method of election. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It is sufficient for purposes of making an election under this paragraph (a)(4) that an Indian tribe evidence the election
in any reasonable way, including use of a particular method. Thus, no written election is required. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Additional withholding permitted. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Consistent with the provisions of section 3402(p)(2), a tribal member and a tribe may enter into an agreement to provide
for the deduction and withholding of additional amounts from payments in order to satisfy the anticipated tax liability
of the tribal member. The agreement may be made in a manner similar to that described in &sect;31.3402(p)&hyph;1 (with
respect to voluntary withholding agreements between employees and employers).

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Parole Commission is clarifying its paroling policy guidelines on using a prior conviction for determining
a prisoner's salient factor score, when the prisoner claims the conviction was obtained in violation of his right
to counsel, and the records of the conviction are not available. This amendment of the salient factor score instructions
was published as an interim rule on March 10, 1994. 59 FR 11185&hyph;86. The final version of the rule is almost identical
to the interim rule. The rule provides that the prisoner must demonstrate that the allegedly invalid conviction must
have occurred prior to Supreme Court decisions establishing the right to counsel for felony and misdemeanor/petty
offense convictions. Otherwise, the Commission will presume that the prior conviction was validly obtained and
will count the conviction even if records of the conviction are no longer available.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The rationale for this revision of the salient factor scoring manual is provided in the supplementary information
for the interim rule. 59 FR 11185&hyph;86. Several comments were received in response to the publication of the interim
rule. One federal defender argued that the interim rule was unfair because if the records of the prior conviction are
not available, the limited information the Commission had about the prior conviction was presumptively unreliable.
But the mere fact that the records of the conviction are no longer available should not lead to the inference that the
conviction did not occur or was obtained using invalid procedures. More likely, the absence of the records would be
caused by their destruction or retirement according to a practice of purging court files on a regular schedule. Another
person asked the Commission to postpone action on the new rule until it assessed to what extent tribal courts have implemented
a defendant's right to counsel. The Commission decided that the promulgation of this rule_which was intended to promptly
clarify its salient factor scoring instruction at Item A, paragraph A.8_should not be deferred for the task of re-examining
tribal court procedures and determining whether a change in a separate instruction at paragraph A.10 should also
be made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Several editorial changes were made in the interim rule. Also, in the final rule the Commission clarifies that the
prisoner would have to claim that he served a jail term for a non-felony, pre-1973 conviction before the Commission
would decline to count such a conviction in salient factor scoring. If the prisoner had not served a jail term for such
a conviction, the conviction would be constitutionally valid even if obtained in violation of his right to counsel.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Parole Commission is adding to its guidelines, under the heading of ``Carnal Knowledge or Sodomy Involving
Minors'' a provision increasing the offense severity rating from Category Four to Category Seven for any crime involving
an adult offender who has abused a position of trust (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, teacher, counselor, or physician), or who has engaged in predatory sexual behavior. The purpose of this guideline
amendment is to clarify the aggravated nature of such crimes in relation to all other offenses that involve non-forcible
sexual relations between an adult and a minor age 12 or older. This item was published as a proposed rule on May 20, 1994.
59 FR 26466. The guideline increase follows a Congressional directive that, when the Commission frequently exceeds
the guidelines in a particular type of case, the guidelines should be amended to provide for consistency in such decisions.

 Federal parole laws remain in effect until November 1, 1997, for prisoners and parolees who committed their crimes
prior to November 1, 1987, and whose sentences place them under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Parole Commission. See
Section 235(b) of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1987, Public Law 98&hyph;473 (as amended) and 18 U.S.C. 4201 through
4218. The Paroling Policy Guidelines at 28 CFR 2.20 provide consistency in Parole Commission decision-making for
such offenders.

The proposed rule would increase the prison time to be served in cases where the adult has committed such an offense
through an abuse of a position of trust, or through predatory behavior. Whereas ordinary offenses involving non-forcible
sexual relations between adults and minors age 12 or older are rated Category Four on the guidelines, offenses involving
abuse of trust or predatory behavior were proposed for a Category Seven rating. One public comment was received on
this proposal from the U.S. Probation Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina supporting the proposal.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After a careful review of its decision-making practices, the Commission has decided that the proposal merits adoption
as a final rule. The increase to Category Seven reflects optimum Commission decision-making practice, which is to
order an upward departure from the guideline range for a Category Four offense if the offender has abused a significant
position of trust or has behaved in a predatory manner toward multiple victims. Such circumstances would constitute
good cause to exceed the guidelines pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 4206(c). An abuse of trust would be exemplified by a child
psychiatrist who engages in sodomy with youthful patients under his care, a high school teacher who seduces a student
in his classroom, or a religious counselor who has sexual relations with teenage members of his congregation. Predatory
behavior is defined as the repeated use of tricks or other devices to lure unsuspecting youthful victims into sexual
relations with an adult offender.

summary:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issues a document that it will begin a one-year experimental modification
of its rules with respect to the role that its Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) play in facilitating the expeditious
resolution of unfair labor practice proceedings. During the experimental period, the NLRB will amend its rules to
give the Chief Administrative Law Judge discretion to assign a judge other than the trial judge to conduct settlement
negotiations with the parties, and to give the settlement judge certain powers necessary to engage effectively in
those settlement efforts. The NLRB will also, during the experimental period, modify its rules to give ALJs assigned
to hear a case the discretion to dispense with briefs, to hear oral argument in lieu of briefs, and to issue bench decisions.
The rule changes will expire at the end of the one-year experimental period absent renewal by the Board.

supplementary information:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On September 8, 1994, the Board issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) which proposed certain modifications
to the Board's rules to permit the assignment of ALJs to serve as settlement judges, and to provide ALJs with the discretion
to dispense with briefs, to hear oral argument in lieu of briefs, and to issue bench decisions (59 FR 46375). The NPR
provided for a comment period ending October 7, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Board received eight written comments on the NPR. The comments were received from a variety of sources, including
unions, employer associations, practitioners, and the academic community. The comments were mixed, with some supporting
some of the proposals but not others, and others supporting none of the proposals. Having carefully considered these
comments, for the reasons discussed below, the Board has decided to implement the proposed changes with certain modifications
for a one-year experimental period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Settlement Judges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposal on the use of settlement judges proposed to amend &sect;102.35 of the Board's rules to include provisions
for the assignment of ALJs to serve as settlement judges. The comments on this proposal were mixed, with two comments
opposing the proposal, two comments supporting the proposal, and two comments suggesting that the proposal be modified
to require the agreement of the parties. (The other two comments made no comment on the proposal.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The comments opposing the proposal generally expressed the view that the proposal was unneeded and unlikely to yield
significant benefits given the Agency's already high settlement rate. The comment submitted by the AFL&hyph;CIO
also expressed the concern that the proposal would diminish the availability of trial judges, cause the postponement
of hearing dates, and have a negative effect on settlement discussion at the Regional level. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 The Board acknowledges that there are potential problems which could arise with the use of settlement judges. The
proposed rules, however, were drafted to minimize any such problems by requiring the assigning judge to consider,
among other factors, the likelihood that a settlement may occur, the good faith of any person making a request for assignment
of a settlement judge, and whether the assignment is otherwise feasible. The Board indicated in the NPR that among
the factors which the assigning judge could consider would be the effect of an assignment upon agency resources, whether
the assignment is being sought for, or would have the effect of, delaying the proceeding, and whether the assignment
might tend to undermine other pending settlement efforts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 As suggested by some of the comments, a further safeguard against abuse of the procedure would be to condition the use
of settlement judges on the agreement of all parties. The proposed rule did not include such a condition or otherwise
permit a party to veto the use of the procedure, but indicated that a party's opposition was a factor for the assigning
judge to consider in assessing whether to appoint a settlement judge. Having considered the comments, however, the
Board agrees that the rule should state clearly that the procedure should not be used unless the parties agree to it.
This should further minimize the potential for problems of the kind discussed by the AFL&hyph;CIO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 In view of the Agency's lack of experience with settlement judges, however, the Board has decided to implement the
procedure at this time for a one-year trial period. If significant problems arise with the procedure during that period,
those problems may be considered by the Board in considering whether to implement the changes permanently.

II. Briefs, Oral Argument, Recommendations, and Bench Decisions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As part of its ongoing review of ways in which unfair labor practice proceedings can be revamped to move the cases more
expeditiously, the Board proposed to give its ALJs the discretion, in appropriate cases, to dispense with post-hearing
briefs or proposed findings and conclusions, to hear oral argument, and to issue bench decisions. These changes were
proposed in the form of amendments to &sect;102.35(j) (renumbered to &sect;102.35(b)(10)), &sect;102.42, and
&sect;102.45(a) of the Board's Rules and Regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the eight comments received, two generally supported or did not oppose these changes, while the remaining comments
generally opposed the changes. The comments opposing the changes generally expressed the concern that dispensing
with post-hearing briefs and issuing bench decisions would be prejudicial to respondents given the absence of pretrial
discovery in Board proceedings, and would result in lower quality ALJ decisions leading to further litigation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with the settlement-judge proposal, the Board recognizes that problems could arise under the proposed changes
if not properly utilized. As the Board noted in the NPR, many cases are not suitable for these expedited procedures,
and if inappropriate cases were selected, the resulting remands could delay the final disposition of the cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As indicated in the NPR, however, the Board believes that if ALJs choose the cases carefully, the benefits of expediting
those cases would outweigh any problems arising in other cases where the procedures are improvidently utilized.
In order to provide some guidance to the ALJs in this regard, the Board in the NPR suggested certain types of cases in
which it may be appropriate to dispense with briefs and/or to issue bench decisions, such as cases that turn on a very
straightforward credibility issue; cases involving one-day hearings; cases involving a well-settled legal issue
where there is no dispute as to the facts; short record single-issue cases; or cases in which a party defaults by not
appearing at the hearing. The Board indicates that in more complex cases, including cases with lengthy records, these
procedures would likely not be appropriate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Board continues to believe that the proposed changes would be beneficial if properly implemented in accordance
with the cautions and guidance expressed by the Board in the NPR. However, in view of the Agency's lack of experience
with such procedures, as with the settlement-judge proposal, the Board has decided to implement the procedure at
this time for a one-year trial period.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the dissent states, the Board has held that a judge's issuance of an oral decision did ``not satisfactorily compl[y]
with the requirements of Section 10(c) of the National Labor Regulations Act, as amended, and Section 102.45 of the
Board's Rules and Regulations, as amended, with regard to the preparation of a written decision.'' See

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
``because he did not issue a written decision,'' inasmuch as the judge had allowed the General Counsel to present his
legal and factual arguments and had stated on the record the reasons for his findings). The rule changes which we adopt
today on an experimental basis are designed to remove any regulatory obstacle which may exist in light of the Board's
decisions in

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In any event, the new provisions on bench decisions do not violate Section 10(c). Section 102.45 of the rules, as amended,
provides that all decisions, including bench decisions, must contain findings of fact, conclusions, and the reasons
or basis therefor upon all material issues of fact and law, as well as a recommended order, including affirmative provisions,
all as required by Section 10(c). The amendments to &sect;102.45 of the rules provide that the administrative law
judge will certify the accuracy of the pages of the transcript which contain the decision and shall cause those pages
to be served on the parties and filed with the Board. Thus, these provisions provide for a written decision, in the form
of a certified copy of the record pages containing the judge's full decision, which is served on the parties, in full
compliance with the provisions of Section 10(c) of the Act. To the extent that the decisions in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
suggest otherwise, we conclude that they are based on a misreading of the requirements of Section 10(c), and they are
overruled by the new provisions of the Rules.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) the NLRB certifies that these rules will not have
a significant impact on small business entities.

In exercising his or her discretion, the chief, deputy chief, or associate chief judge making the assignment will
consider, among other factors, whether there is reason to believe that resolution of the dispute is likely, the request
for assignment of a settlement judge is made in good faith, and the assignment is otherwise feasible.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The settlement judge shall convene and preside over conferences and settlement negotiations between the parties,

negotiations, recommending continuation or termination of the settlement negotiations. Where feasible, settlement
conferences shall be held in person. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Participation of the settlement judge shall terminate upon the order of the chief, deputy, or associates issued
after consultation with the settlement judge. The conduct of settlement negotiations shall not unduly delay the
hearing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) All discussions between the parties and the settlement judge shall be confidential. The settlement judge shall
not discuss any aspect of the case with the trial judge, and no evidence regarding statements, conduct, offers of settlement,
and concessions of the parties made in proceedings before the settlement judge shall be admissible in any proceeding
before the Board, except by stipulation of the parties. Documents disclosed in the settlement process may not be used
in litigation unless voluntarily produced or obtained pursuant to subpoena. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Any party shall be entitled, upon request, to a reasonable period at the close of the hearing for oral argument, which

of the hearing, file a brief or proposed findings and conclusions, or both, with the administrative law judge, who
may fix a reasonable time for such filing, but not in excess of 35 days from the close of the hearing. Requests for further
extensions of time shall be made to the chief administrative law judge in Washington, D.C., to the deputy chief judge
in San Francisco, California, to the associate chief judge in New York, New York, or to the associate chief judge in
Atlanta, Georgia, as the case may be. Notice of the request for any extension shall be immediately served on all other
parties, and proof of service shall be furnished. Three copies of the brief or proposed findings and conclusions shall
be filed with the administrative law judge, and copies shall be served on the other parties, and a statement of such
service shall be furnished. In any case in which the administrative law judge believes that written briefs or proposed
findings of fact and conclusions may not be necessary, he or she shall notify the parties at the opening of the hearing
or as soon thereafter as practicable that he or she may wish to hear oral argument in lieu of briefs.

disposition of the case should be made, which may include, if it be found that the respondent has engaged in or is engaging
in the alleged unfair labor practices, a recommendation for such affirmative action by the respondent as will effectuate
the policies of the Act. The administrative law judge shall file the original of his decision with the Board and cause
a copy thereof to be served on each of the parties. If the administrative law judge delivers a bench decision, promptly
upon receiving the transcript the judge shall certify the accuracy of the pages of the transcript containing the decision;
file with the Board a certified copy of those pages, together with any supplementary matter the judge may deem necessary
to complete the decision; and cause a copy thereof to be served on each of the parties. Upon the filing of the decision,
the Board shall enter an order transferring the case to the Board and shall serve copies of the order, setting forth
the date of such transfer, on all the parties. Service of the administrative law judge's decision and of the order transferring

1. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We are not opposed to the provision regarding settlement judges. We have some concerns that the provision may tempt
respondents to delay settlement talks with the Regional Offices and thereby upset the highly successful settlement
efforts of those offices. However, we are willing, in light of the one-year sunset provision, to join our colleagues
in promulgating this provision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We are strongly opposed, however, to the rules that give Administrative Law Judges (ALJs or Judges) the discretion
to dispense with briefs and to issue bench decisions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
2. Statutory Issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a threshold matter, we note that, under established Board law, the provision for bench decisions directly contravenes
the Act. In 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plastic Film Products Corp., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
232 NLRB 722 (1977), the Board held that such decisions fail to comply not only with Section 102.45 of the Board's Rules
and Regulations, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
but also with Section 10(c) of the Act. Id. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
at 722. See also 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Local Union No. 195 (Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corp.), 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
237 NLRB 931 (1978) (oral grant of motion for summary dismissal of complaint at close of hearing violates Section 10(c)
as well as Section 102.45 of Board's Rules and Regulations).
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 Thus, the Board's new rule reverses established Board law.

Contrary to the assertion of our colleagues, it is clear that Section 10(c) was indeed one of the obstacles to the oral
decisions in these cases. Only one Member (Murphy) relied solely on the Rules. The majority relied on Section 10(c)
and the Rules.

In arguing to the contrary, our colleagues rely upon

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Jumbo Produce, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
294 NLRB 998. However, that case is readily distinguishable. In that case, the judge made an oral evidentiary ruling
on a single issue. He did not rule on the entire case. Indeed, the Board specifically noted this in distinguishing its
earlier ruling in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Local Union 195. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
See 294 NLRB at 999 n.4. We have no quarrel with the traditional practice under which judges issue bench rulings on evidentiary
issues. But the instant rule goes far beyond that. It gives the judge the power to orally decide the entire case.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We recognize that, in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Local Union 195, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the judge did not read any findings and conclusions into the record. However, in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Plastic Film Products, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the judge did precisely that. Notwithstanding this, the Board found that the judge's decision violated Section 10(c)
of the Act.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
highly questionable, but he agrees that it at least presents an additional issue that parties might raise in the courts
when seeking review of cases decided by bench rulings. As we argue below, to the extent that further grounds for appellate
litigation are provided, the asserted delay-minimizing objective of the rule is undermined.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In sum, the rules are at odds with Board law. Our colleagues, in apparent recognition of this fact, overrule Board law
to the extent necessary to accomplish their purpose. However, they set forth no rationale for this result other than
the assertion that the cases are based on a ``misreading'' of Section 10(c). They offer no support for this sweeping
assertion. Further, they may not have the power to overrule the extant cases. If the Board was correct in the prior cases,
i.e., if Congress did indeed intend to preclude bench decisions in enacting Section 10(c), then the Board is simply
without authority to establish a rule to the contrary. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
467 U.S. 837, 842&hyph;43 (1984) (where intent of Congress is clear, agency must give effect to that intent).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although the Board has now declared that it has the power to issue the rule, that declaration will not end the matter.
The statutory issue will undoubtedly be the subject of extended litigation in the federal courts. Thus, for this reason
as well as other reasons described 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
infra, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
the rule is at cross-purposes with its stated goal: to expedite the final resolution of unfair labor practice cases.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
3. Policy Considerations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We do not rest entirely, or even principally, on the statutory issue. Quite apart from the statutory issue, we oppose,
for policy reasons, the provisions giving ALJs the power to issue bench decisions and the related power to dispense
with written briefs. In our view, the rules sacrifice fundamental fairness, procedural due process and high-quality
decisionmaking. This sacrifice is said to be in the interest of speed. However, we are not convinced that the rules
will result in any overall savings of time. More importantly, to the extent that they might save some time, the price
is simply too high.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
We first address the rule concerning briefs. Underlying much of our concern about this rule is one critical fact: NLRB
proceedings are conducted without pre-trial discovery. Thus, far from involving a rehash of previous deposition
testimony and jousting over the significance of documents long ago made available to the opposing side, Board trials
typically represent the first occasion on which the parties learn the details of their opponent's case.
<FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>
 Notwithstanding this fact, the rule would require counsel, promptly upon the close of evidence, to marshal the pertinent
facts, spot all the factual and legal issues, cite the relevant authority, and articulate policy concerns_all in
a cogent and organized fashion. In our view, even the ablest of counsel cannot be expected to do an effective job under
these circumstances. Moreover, as some of the comments on the proposed rules have pointed out,
<FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>
 counsel for respondents will be at a distinct disadvantage under this scheme. Armed with the information gathered
in the pre-complaint investigation, the General Counsel is in a much better position than respondent's counsel to
plot out in advance an oral presentation of the facts and the law.

As noted 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
infra, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
the General Counsel will ordinarily have some prior knowledge of the specifics of the respondent's case, with the
extent of that knowledge varying with the degree of cooperation extended by the respondent during the pre-complaint
investigation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
</FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The rule is otherwise flawed. Although it provides for a ``reasonable period'' for oral argument, it does not provide
such a period for the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
preparation 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of the argument. Further, even if a judge granted such a period, that would not cure the fundamental defect in this provision.
A recess period is simply no substitute for the time-honored practice of reading the transcript, researching the
issues by use of a library and computer technology, reflecting upon the law and the facts, and writing a cogent, organized
and persuasive brief.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Requiring counsel to throw together a presentation at the close of the trial also creates a real danger that relevant
points will be overlooked. The consequences of any such omission or oversight can be severe. If a party fails to raise
a point before the ALJ, it may well have waived its right to raise that issue before the Board. See, e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

287 NLRB 602, n.1 (1987). Issues not raised before the Board, of course, cannot ordinarily be raised on appeal. See
NLRB Section 10(e).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For all of the reasons discussed above, we believe that dispensing with briefs is fundamentally unfair to the participants
in Board proceedings. We further believe that this practice will erode the quality of decision-making by ALJs. As
any decision-maker can attest, the decisional process is greatly facilitated by access to thorough and competent
written arguments on both sides of the issue. Substituting hasty and perhaps ill-considered oral presentations
for written briefs cannot help but make the job of the ALJ more difficult, as well as that of the Board members and federal
judges who must review the ALJ's decision.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The provision allowing ALJs to issue decisions from the bench is perhaps even more objectionable. First of all, the
threat to the quality of ALJ decisions posed by dispensing with briefing will only be compounded by the absence of a
written ALJ decision. In essence, the Judge will have just heard oral arguments, which were constructed without benefit
of time for assimilation, research, organization and reflection. The judge will thereupon render a decision, without
an independent opportunity for assimilation, research, organization and reflection. In our view, such a process
is not a recipe for excellence_or even quality_in decision-making.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The use of bench decisions, moreover, is bound to compound the Board's difficulties in the federal courts. In recent
years, reviewing courts have shown an increasing propensity to remand cases to the Board (or simply to reverse the
Board outright) on grounds that the Board has not adequately articulated the basis for its decision. Our colleagues
nonetheless wish to implement a rule that can only exacerbate this problem.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the new rule recognizes, ALJ bench decisions are not exempt from the requirements of the Administrative Procedures
Act (APA), which provides that all decisions ``shall include a statement of *&blank;*&blank;* findings and conclusions,
and the reasons or basis therefore, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
on all the material issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record *&blank;*&blank;*.''
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 5 U.S.C. Section 557(c) (1988) (emphasis added). Just as the most competent of counsel will have difficulty constructing
a cogent oral argument on the spot, so, too will even the ablest of ALJs have difficulty covering all the basis required
by the APA in a bench decision_especially one rendered without the benefit of written briefs. The question whether
the Judge's oral decision complies with the APA will thus, as noted in comments on the proposed rule,
<FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>
 provide fertile ground for litigation before the circuit courts as well as the Board.

In addition, we are not convinced that resorting to bench decisions will result in any net savings of time_the driving
force behind this provision. Litigation over the adequacy of the Judge's oral findings is almost certain to add time
at both the Board and court levels. Indeed, the mere opportunity to litigate this procedural issue may result in the
appeal of cases that would not otherwise be taken up_for instance, Section 8(a)(3) cases that turn largely on the Judge's
factual findings. Moreover, where the Judge has indeed failed to make all the proper findings, the Board will have
to attempt, where possible, to supply the missing ingredients itself, or else remand the case for further findings_both
time-consuming processes. Further remands will be doubt occur at the circuit court level when the court disagrees
with the Board's determination regarding the adequacy of the findings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, litigation over the ``adequacy'' issue, and the necessity for remands in some cases, will add time to the process.
In our view, this additional time will likely be greater than the time saved by dispensing with a written decision.
<FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>
 Whereas a remand will likely result in a minimum of several months of delay, requiring a written decision (after the
filing of briefs) should add at most several weeks to the decision time in a ``simple'' case_a period that can be kept
to a minimum by encouraging ALJs to set short briefing schedules in appropriate cases.

In this regard, we do not share our colleagues' apparent belief that remands can be avoided by carefully culling out
only relatively simple cases. The rule, of course, does not confine use of the procedure to any particular kind of case.
Even if ALJs attempt to abide by the ``suggestions'' put forth by the Board, there will undoubtedly be cases where the
prediction is not borne out. A case that appears ``simple'' may turn out not to be so simple after all. This is particularly
true, given the absence of discovery. The fact that the ALJ knows little about the case until the evidence unfolds at
trial increases the risk that a case that appears at first blush to require only a straightforward credibility determination
or the application of a well-settled principle of law may, upon reflection, turn out to involve much more.

The concerns set forth above are shared by most of the persons and organizations submitting comments. The great bulk
of the comments submitted to the Board express strong opposition both to dispensing with briefs and to oral ALJ decisions.
<FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>
 Indeed, the proposed rules are characterized in such terms as ``ill-advised'', ``unwarranted'', and as ``sacrific[ing]
accuracy, fairness and quality for expedience.''
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 The sole comment that fully supports the proposed rule completely ignores one of our primary sources of concern (discussed
extensively in our earlier statement as well as in our dissent today)_the lack of discovery in Board proceedings.
The comment is thus unpersuasive.

See Comment of Laurence Gold &amp; James Coppess (AFL&hyph;CIO). This comment asserts that ``a number of federal
administrative agencies expressly authorize oral decisions by ALJs,'' and urges us to join the crowd. See id. at 5.
Its citations support this claim as to three agencies or administrative bodies_the Maritime Administration of the
Department of Transportation, the National Transportation Safety Board, and the Department of Agriculture. The
rules of two of these bodies, however, expressly provide for discovery, see 49 C.F.R. Section 821.19 (1993) (National
Transportation Safety Board); 46 C.F.R. Section 201.109 (1993) (Maritime Administration); and those of the third
provide for a pre-hearing conference at which the Judge may compel the parties to furnish certain information regarding
their case, including documents they intend to introduce, see 7 C.F.R. Section 1.140 (1994) (Department of Agriculture).
This comment's analogy to bench decisions issued by the federal district courts is similarly wide of the mark; those
proceedings, of course, are conducted in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provide for
extensive pre-trial discovery.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Like our colleagues, we are in favor of expediting the Board's processes. The rules being implemented today, however,
are unlikely to achieve that end, and in any event would do so at a cost that is much too high to pay. That price includes:
a lack of fundamental fairness in Board proceedings, a decline in the quality of the agency's decisional product,
and increasing tension in our relationship with the federal courts.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In our quest for speed, we must be careful not to undermine the fundamental goals of fairness in our decisional procedure
and excellence in our decisional product. Because we believe that the rules approved by our colleagues will do just
that, we dissent.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Amendments to OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) were published on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6126). The modified
final rule included a number of minor changes and technical amendments to further clarify the requirements of the
HCS published August 24, 1987 (52 FR 31852). The amendments included a new exemption to the standard's requirements.
Section (b)(6)(ii) intended to exempt any hazardous substance as such term is defined by the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), only when subject to comprehensive regulations issued under the Act by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Need for Correction
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The language of the CERCLA exemption was patterned after the language of the Resources Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA) exemption that precedes it. However, this has led to possible misinterpretation because CERCLA, unlike
RCRA, regulates many chemicals in the limited circumstances of remedial and removal actions and does not pervasively
regulate those chemicals. It was OSHA's intent to exempt CERCLA-listed chemicals only in circumstances where they
are fully regulated by EPA, making OSHA's HCS requirements duplicative.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consequently, OSHA is correcting the language to make this clear. The new language states that the exemption applies
to any hazardous substance as that term is defined by CERCLA when the hazardous substance is the focus of remedial or
removal action being conducted under CERCLA in accordance with EPA regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This document also corrects a typographical error in section (c) of the standard and eliminates a confusing clause.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
In 1984, the Congress enacted legislation, Pub. L. 98&hyph;506 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(98 Stat. 2338) codified at 16 U.S.C. 460
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
l
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&hyph;22(c) (the Act), to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibit the operation of ``solid waste disposal sites'' within units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the National Park System except for those ``operating as of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 1, 1984,'' or those ``used only for disposal of wastes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated within that unit so long as such site will not degrade 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any of the natural or cultural resources'' of the unit. The Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
went on to direct the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations to ``carry out the provisions of this subsection, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including reasonable regulations to mitigate the adverse effects of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste disposal sites in operation as of September 1, 1984, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
upon the property of the United States.'' The regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implement those statutory provisions. Further authority for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the restriction and controls on operations of existing solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal sites is found in the Act of August 16, 1916, as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amended, (NPS Organic Act) codified at 16 U.S.C. 1 and 3.

Summary of Comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
These rules were published in proposed form for public comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
December 13, 1993 (58 FR 65141&hyph;65149) with a comment period of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
60 calendar days. The comment period closed at the end of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business, February 11, 1994. The National Park Service received 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seven timely comments regarding the proposed regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because Federal offices in Washington, DC were closed on February 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
11, 1994 due to a snow emergency, and the NPS could not accept 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on that day, the NPS accepted comments received on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Monday, February 14, 1994. Comments were received from two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States, two individuals, one organization, and two offices within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the National Park Service. Of the seven comments, three were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either fully supportive of the rule or advocated further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrictions. The other four comments questioned both the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scope and the meaning of the rule.

Section 6.2&blank;Applicability and Scope 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations are generally applicable to any solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal site operated in, or proposed for operation in, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
units of the National Park System. Two comments sought 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
clarification of this rule and how it coincides with State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations. The States, under the overall aegis of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are the primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulatory authorities for solid waste disposal sites on all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands within the boundaries of National Park System units, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including Federal lands (See Resource Conservation and Recovery 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Act at 42 U.S.C. 6961). This rule does not duplicate existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State regulatory controls for solid waste disposal sites in units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the National Park System. Rather, this rule governs the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions under which a solid waste disposal site may exist within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the boundaries of a National Park System unit, not whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site meets the standards of EPA and State regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The National Park Service does not intend to displace the States by administering the standards of 40 CFR parts 257
and 258, Solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste Disposal Facility Criteria, to sites within the boundaries of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Park System units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment asked what action the National Park Service would take 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should the appropriate unit of State or local government fail to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply the standards at 40 CFR parts 257 and 258 to a solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site within a National Park System unit. In such cases, the NPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional Director for the unit involved would notify the EPA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the appropriate States to secure enforcement of regulations by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proper entity. Where an operator of a solid waste disposal site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is governed by a National Park Service permit under 36 CFR 6.4, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6.5, or 6.6 of this part, the Regional Director may, among other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
things, revoke a permit to operate under &sect;6.12 of this part for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator failure to comply with EPA or State regulations governing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste disposal. Language has been added to &sect;6.12 of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule to include noncompliance with State regulations or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards at 40 CFR parts 257 and 258 as a basis for which permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revocation, forfeiture of bond, or penalties may be applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment requested that the rule also apply to solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal sites adjacent to units of the National Park System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the context of Pub. L. 98&hyph;506, the Service concludes that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation of existing sites and the prohibition of new sites apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only to lands and waters within the boundaries of a National Park 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System unit. Therefore, the final rule does not extend its reach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
beyond unit boundaries.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Three comments questioned whether the rule applies to nonfederal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands within the boundaries of National Park System units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule, as does the proposed, applies to all nonfederal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands within such boundaries, without regard to title. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress explicitly directed that the law apply ``*&blank;*&blank;* within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundary of any unit of the National Park System.'' It is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the authority of the National Park Service to rewrite an act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Congress and limit the rule's applicability to only ``Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands within the boundary.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are many statutes establishing National Park System units. A brief survey of these statutes disclosed that
the phrase 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``within the boundaries'' is commonly employed to refer to both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal land and nonfederally owned land or interests in land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the outer boundaries a unit. The statute, Pub. L. 98&hyph;506, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that mandates this final rule specifically uses the term ``
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the boundary 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
of any unit of the National Park System.'' (Emphasis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
added) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment from Alaska noted that 36 CFR 1.2 applies only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certain regulations to nonfederal lands, and then, only in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those units under the concurrent or exclusive legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction of the United States. However, the self-imposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limitation of 36 CFR 1.2(b) applies only to regulations at 36 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR parts 1 through 5 and 7. Because Congress specifically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enacted a statute, Pub. L. 98&hyph;506, that applies to all lands within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the boundaries of a unit, the regulations derived from that statute are not limited by 36 CFR 1.2(b). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The situation most analogous to 36 CFR part 6 is 36 CFR part 9, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subpart A, Mining and Mining Claims. The regulations at 36 CFR part 9A apply to all mining claims within a unit, both
patented and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unpatented, and in all parks, even in those where the United 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States exercises neither concurrent nor exclusive legislative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
jurisdiction. Thus, for example, patented claims, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
private property in every sense of the word, in Death Valley 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Monument, or the Kantishna area of Denali National Park 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Preserve (areas of proprietary jurisdiction only) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governed by 36 CFR part 9 subpart A, notwithstanding 36 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1.2(b). The same principle applies to 36 CFR part 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three comments questioned whether the regulations apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfederal lands within unit boundaries in units of the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Park System specifically in Alaska. (Alaska units of the National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Park System contain approximately 2.7 million nonfederal acres of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a total of over 54 million acres encompassed within their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries, or approximately 5% of the total acreage.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The basis for the comments from Alaska lies in section 103(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(16 U.S.C. 3103(c)). That language states:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
Only those lands within the boundaries of any conservation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system unit which are public lands (as such term is defined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in this Act) shall be deemed to be included as a portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of such unit. No lands which, before, on, or after the date of enactment of this act, are conveyed to the State, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to any Native Corporation, or any private party shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
subject to the regulations applicable 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
solely
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 to public lands within such units. If the State, a Native 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Corporation, or other owner desires to convey any such lands, the Secretary may acquire such lands in accordance with
applicable law (including this Act), and any such lands shall 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
become part of the unit,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
 and be administered accordingly. (Emphasis added)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 04 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
The comments from Alaska cite this language to raise the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant issue of whether nonfederal lands within National Park System units in Alaska are part of the units at
all, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thus subject to any NPS regulations, including the final rule at 36 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR part 6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 103(c) language creates a question of statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
interpretation. Namely, does this section effectively render the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste site law (Pub. L. 98&hyph;506), and its implementing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, inapplicable to all nonfederal lands in National Park 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System units in Alaska? Or does it simply mean that the non-federal lands are not be to be administered as part of the

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conservation unit in the same manner as the Federal lands? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Service's opinion that the language of section 103(c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not render the final rule at 36 CFR part 6 inapplicable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfederal lands in units of the National Park System in Alaska 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because of the presence of the word ``solely.'' Since Pub. L. 98&hyph;506 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorizes the regulation of solid waste disposal sites, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibits all but certain such sites, ``within the boundary of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit of the National Park System,'' neither the law, nor its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations apply ``solely'' to public lands within the units. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The other possibility is that section 103(c) renders Pub. L.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``within the boundary of any unit of the National Park System.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The first sentence of section 103(c) specifies:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Only those lands within the boundaries of any

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(as such term is defined in this Act) shall be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deemed to be included as a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 -->
portion of such unit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->
.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this argument, since nonfederal lands are not ``a portion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of'' a unit, they are not ``within the boundary of a National Park 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System unit'' and thus not subject to this regulation. The Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believes that the better view of the law negates this argument. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pub. L. 98&hyph;506 applies ``within the boundary of any unit of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Park System.'' Words in a statute generally are to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given their common meaning. The common understanding of the words 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``within the boundary'' is that something be within the outer limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It does not mean the same thing as ``a portion of.'' Perhaps the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
best indication of this analysis is the use of the word ``within'' in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Alaska Lands Act itself. Section 1301(b)(7) (16 U.S.C. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3191(b)), refers to ``privately owned areas, if any, which are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
within such unit
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
.'' Thus, while there are no privately-owned areas 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which are ``a portion of'' the unit, the Alaska Lands Act recognizes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that there are privately-owned areas ``within'' a unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 103(c) itself speaks of ``only those lands within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries of any conservation system unit which are public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands,'' thus implying the existence of non-public lands within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
those boundaries. The Service therefore concludes from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
language of section 103(c) itself that nonfederal lands are ``within'' the boundaries of Alaska units of the National
Park System 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
even if they are not ``a portion of'' the unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The comments from Alaska offer an opportunity to further clarify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the applicability of 36 CFR part 6 and illuminate the exceptions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this rule that are specifically aimed at small private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residential inholders. Persons who either reside or farm within 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the exterior boundaries of a National Park System unit need not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submit a request and obtain a permit from the Regional Director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the disposal of residential or agricultural wastes on their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed rule at &sect;6.2(c)(iii) stated that such waste could be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposed of ``on lands or waters'' that ``he or she owns or leases'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the unit. In response to two comments, the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deletes the word ``waters'' since disposing of solid waste in water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or wetlands may likely violate other laws. In the interest of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gender neutrality, the word ``person'' is substituted for ``he or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
she.''

One comment noted that &sect;6.2(d) exempts the NPS from its own rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at this part. Two comments asked how the NPS will ensure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compliance with conditions of &sect;6.4 for NPS-operated solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal sites, if the procedural, administrative, financial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assurance and penalty provisions of the proposed regulations do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not apply to NPS operated solid waste disposal sites. The NPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will adhere to the conditions of &sect;6.4 (for a new, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expanded existing solid waste disposal site) and to the conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of &sect;6.5 (for existing NPS operated solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sites) as a matter of policy and special directive. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NPS will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(42 U.S.C. 4321, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and, at a minimum, prepare an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental assessment for any new, or expansion of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing, solid waste disposal site that the NPS proposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule changes the word ``procedural'' at &sect;6.2(d) to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``permit'' for clarity. The reason why the permit, bond and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalty provisions do not apply to the NPS is that there is no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means by which the NPS may be both the permitting agency and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permittee, the bond-poster and the bond-holder, the enforcer and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the violator, simultaneously.

Section 6.3&blank;Definitions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In response to one comment, note that the proposed, as well as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final, definition of the term ``agricultural waste'' includes waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting from the ``harvesting of .&blank;.&blank;. trees.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment specifically sought clarification about whether 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concession operations in parks, whether under contracts or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial use licenses are ``exempt'' from the regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This question is best answered by discussing the definition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the term ``National Park Service activities.'' There must be a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary connection between the NPS and the establishment of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste disposal site after the passage of the Act. ``National 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Park Service activities'' includes activities conducted by NPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractors, concessionaires and commercial use licensees because such persons, under agreement with the NPS,
provide eating, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lodging, transportation and other services to park visitors or to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
park management itself. Since the NPS may operate a new solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal site within a unit for NPS activities, the NPS may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approve new sites for the disposal of solid waste generated by NPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractors, concessionaires and commercial use licensees. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons may also dispose of solid waste in existing NPS operated or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approved sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While NPS contractors, concessionaires and commercial use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
licensees may dispose of solid waste on lands within a unit, any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposal by such a person to establish their own new site for solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal, or continue to operate and use their own existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste disposal site, is fully governed by 36 CFR 6.4 or 6.5 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The disposal of solid waste by such persons, while permissible on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands within a National Park System unit, must be subject to full 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPS scrutiny. The NPS has a fundamental obligation to ensure that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contractors, concessionaires and commercial use licensees dispose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of solid waste on lands within a unit, even the remote lands in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Alaska, in an environmentally sensitive manner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Residential waste,'' as defined in &sect;6.3, means waste generated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the normal activities of a household. One comment suggested that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the residential waste exception at &sect;6.2(c) not include paper, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plastic and metal. Since the &sect;6.2(c) exception is intended to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimize the solid waste stream by providing an alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal means for agricultural or residential solid wastes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are compostible, we have partially adopted the suggestion. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final rule defines ``residential waste'' to exclude plastic and metal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste, since these are not compostible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment appeared to confuse the ``residential waste'' exception 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this part with the ``household waste exclusion'' that exists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at 40 CFR 261.4(b)(1). The definition of ``residential solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste'' used in this part comes from 40 CFR part 243. That 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
definition means waste generated by the normal activities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households. This definition applies only to residences, not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial activities, such as lodges, motels or eating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establishments. On the other hand, the EPA definition at 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
261.4(b)(1) broadly excludes ``household waste'' from the legal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meaning of hazardous waste. The 40 CFR part 261 meaning of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``household waste'' includes waste generated by residences AND 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial lodging and eating establishments. It does not follow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that because 36 CFR part 6 largely excludes residential waste from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
its control, that the NPS is also somehow excluding waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from commercial lodging or eating establishments. The fact that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes generated by such establishments are specifically excluded 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the definition of ``hazardous waste'' under RCRA regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not make such wastes ``residential wastes'' for the purposes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this regulation. These two issues are unrelated and are addressed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in separate sections of this regulation.

One comment suggested that the proposed definition of ``solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal site'' is so broad that it would encompass lands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the Exxon Valdez spilled oil. The Service agrees, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inserts language in the final definition of ``solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site'' to make clear that 36 CFR part 6 does not govern discharges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of materials, or substances into the environment that are covered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by such laws as the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(3)) and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comprehensive Environmental Response and Compensation and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). It was never the intent of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NPS to regulate such discharges or deposits as if they were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``solid waste disposal sites.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One comment suggested that this rule also govern ``transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stations,'' since they are places where solid waste is deposited, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
albeit temporarily. Because such stations may be places of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant degradation to park resources resulting from noise, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
litter, visual intrusion, runoff and traffic, the Service has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
decided to include transfer stations in the definition of a ``solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal site.''

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that the EPA's definition of ``hazardous waste'' at 40 CFR part 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
261 excludes wastes generated by households (including single and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple family residences, hotels and motels). In light of one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment, the Service reiterates that such waste is not ``legally'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous. This ``household waste exclusion'' is mentioned here again because it is important to point out that the
prohibition at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;6.4(a)(6)(i) and at &sect;6.5(c)(3)(i) does not prevent the NPS from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
accepting for disposal at NPS-operated solid waste disposal sites, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid wastes such as used oil, grease, paints, solvents, cleaning 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agents, or pesticides that are generated by ``households.'' Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials are not ``legally'' hazardous waste when discarded by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
households (including hotels, motels, restaurants, single or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
multiple family residences). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, as long as such waste is generated by National Park Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activities, such as garbage collection from park/concessionaire 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employees, they may be disposed of in an NPS-operated solid waste

In response to comments from the NPS Alaska Region, the Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
points out that both the proposed and the final rule recognize 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that some communities may lie wholly within the boundaries of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit of the National Park System in Alaska. Such communities may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhaust the capacity of their existing solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site. Such communities may request that the Regional Director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit them to expand an existing site within the unit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional Director must normally judge such a request under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions in &sect;6.4. However, the Regional Director will instead 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
judge a request for expansion of an existing site under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approval conditions of &sect;6.5(c), if the operator shows that the solid waste is generated solely from within the
boundaries of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unit, the operator owns or leases the lands proposed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expansion, and the solid waste disposal site lacks road, rail or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate water access to any lands outside of the unit for all, or

One comment asked how this part applies to operations on mining

claims. This section is intended to clarify the relationship

between the final regulations governing solid waste disposal and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing regulations at 36 CFR part 9, Minerals Management, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
govern mineral operations. Without this section, this final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation would govern solid waste disposal sites by all 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mineral operators. The NPS now regulates solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by many mineral operators and does not intend to create a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
duplicate regulatory scheme for such operators. Thus, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section excludes from the permit and financial assurance provisions of the final regulations solid waste disposal
sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by operators that are, now or prospectively, governed by NPS

regulations at 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal mineral

One comment asked if the NPS would establish a household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``harmful'' waste collection program for its inholders. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
answer is ``No.'' Inholders may not dispose of their waste in NPS operated solid waste disposal sites. Nor is the NPS
in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
business of collecting waste from inholders. Moreover, the NPS 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will establish collection programs for household waste that, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
though not legally hazardous, may be harmful, ONLY in those units 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the NPS operates a solid waste disposal site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The same comment then seemed to suggest that since the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations at 36 CFR 6.8(b) mandate the establishment of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collection programs for ``household hazardous wastes'' ONLY for parks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that operate solid waste disposal sites, then only such parks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need have hazardous waste collection programs. This is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorrect. Every park that generates waste that is defined by 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CFR part 261 as hazardous, must collect, store, handle and manage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that waste under the regulations governing such waste prescribed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Subtitle D of RCRA. To eliminate confusion, the final rule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at &sect;6.8(b) no longer refers to ``household hazardous waste'' which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legally is not ``hazardous'' but to ``harmful wastes generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by residential activities.''

One comment asked if this section applies the penalties to solid waste disposal sites on ``private inholdings.''
The answer is yes, 36 CFR part 6, including its penalty provisions, applies to solid waste disposal sites on nonfederal
lands, insofar as such lands are within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System.

Section 6.2&blank;Applicability and Scope
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulations are generally applicable to any solid waste disposal site operated in, or proposed for operation
in, units of the National Park System. While the NPS is concerned with the disposal of all solid wastes on all lands and
waters within unit boundaries, the rule provides for certain exceptions. This final rule at &sect;6.2(c) does not
require that all persons who either reside or farm within the exterior boundaries of a National Park System unit submit
a request and obtain a permit from the Regional Director for the disposal of residential or agricultural wastes on
their lands. Paragraph (c) provides that a person residing within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System
may dispose of certain solid wastes without a permit or penalty unless the person requires a State or local permit or
license to dispose of solid waste. The final rule enumerates conditions under which such persons may dispose of waste.
This exemption does not apply to the disposal of agricultural pesticides, pesticide equipment or containers.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exception is intended to minimize the solid waste stream by providing an alternative disposal means for agricultural
or residential solid wastes that are compostible.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the Superintendent of the affected unit determines that the disposal of agricultural or residential solid wastes
poses a reasonable probability of threat to public health or the environment, as described in the regulations at 40
CFR part 257, the Superintendent will notify the Regional Director and the resident that the request, permit, and
penalty provisions of 36 CFR part 6 are applicable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph 6.2(d) explains the effect of the regulations on NPS operated sites. Existing and new solid waste disposal
sites operated or proposed by the NPS for administration of the National Park System must meet the standards prescribed
in 40 CFR subchapter I, specifically at 40 CFR part 241, Guidelines for the Land Disposal of Solid Waste; part 257, Criteria
for Classification of Solid Waste Disposal Facilities and Practices, and part 258 Criteria for Municipal Solid Waste
Landfills, and by appropriate State laws. The permit, administrative, financial assurance and penalty provisions
of the final rule do not apply to NPS operated landfills. However, the NPS will adhere to the conditions of &sect;6.4
to establish a new, or expand an existing, solid waste disposal site for NPS activities. The NPS will also adhere to
the conditions of &sect;6.5 to continue operations at existing NPS operated solid waste disposal sites. In addition,
the NPS will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and, at a minimum, prepare an environmental assessment for any new, or expansion of any existing, solid waste disposal
site that the NPS proposes.

Section 6.3&blank;Definitions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The definitions section of the rule applies to terms that are not otherwise defined in 36 CFR part 1. The words defined
in the rule either come from the legislation on which the rule is based or are included to enhance the clarity and accuracy
of the rule. The primary purposes of the definitions are to make clear the reach and applicability of the rule for the
NPS and the regulated community and to ensure that actions taken under the rule are consistent and predictable. In
most cases, other statutes serve as the bases for the precise wording selected. These statutes are referred to in the
discussions of the definitions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``boundaries'' of any unit of the National Park System comes from the language of the statute. It is defined
in the final rule to include all lands within units of the National Park System, regardless of jurisdictional status
or ownership. Many units of the National Park System include nonfederal lands. Solid waste disposal on both Federal
and nonfederal lands within National Park System unit boundaries come under the purview of this rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because there are no limitations on applicability to any class or type of lands in the statutory language, the rule
defines the term broadly. The definition includes waters as well as lands because of the breadth of the statutory language
and because the effects of such solid waste disposal sites are not limited to lands, but can also affect waters, particularly
groundwater.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule adds a definition for the term ``compostible materials.'' The Service determines that facilities
for the management of compostible materials are not solid waste disposal sites for the purpose of these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Also defined is the term, ``National Park Service activities.'' It is explained for two reasons: First, to clarify
that there must be a necessary connection between the NPS and the establishment of solid waste disposal sites after
the passage of the Act; second, beginning one year after the effective date of the regulations, only persons engaged
in ``National Park Service activities,'' as defined herein, may dispose of solid waste in an NPS operated solid waste
disposal site. ``National Park Service activities'' thus includes activities conducted by NPS contractors, concessionaires
and commercial use licensees. Such persons, under agreement with the NPS, provide eating, lodging, transportation
and other services to park visitors. Since new solid waste disposal sites may be established in National Park System
units for NPS activities only, new sites may accept for disposal waste generated only by these persons. NPS contractors,
concessionaires, and commercial use licensees may also dispose of solid waste in existing NPS operated sites. ``National
Park Service activities'' do not include activities engaged in by Special Use Permittees (Form 10&hyph;114). Waste
disposal by Special Use Permittees and others is governed by all the substantive, permit, financial assurance and
penalty provisions of &sect;6.4 for a new waste disposal site, or &sect;6.5 for an existing site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The word ``degrade'' also comes from the statute and is defined as ``to lessen in quantity, quality, or value.'' It
is included in the terms defined in the rule for the sake of clarity and predictability. Since the statutorily mandated
standard for any solid waste disposal site operating in a park unit is that the operation not ``degrade'' park resources,
this section provides guidance as to how the term degrade is to be used by the NPS in determining such effects.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The terms ``agricultural solid waste,'' ``residential solid waste'' and ``leachate,'' are defined as they are in
the regulations that govern solid waste under the authority of the Resource Recovery and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C.
6901 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) and implemented at 40 CFR part 243, Guidelines for the Storage and Collection of Residential, Commercial, and Institutional
Solid Waste. The term ``hazardous waste'' refers to the definition of such solid waste prescribed at 40 CFR part 261,
Identification and Listing of Hazardous Wastes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``Natural resources'' is defined here so as to provide a comprehensive inventory of the inherent attributes of National
Park System units that may be affected by solid waste disposal sites. The detailed listing of resource attributes
is designed to enable the agency and the regulated community sufficient consistency and specificity to evaluate
potential effects to the parks. The Report of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs (House Report 98&hyph;1069)
that accompanied the Act said, ``the conditions of noise, air pollution, waste disposal in surrounding lands, rat
and other pest problems, and area disruption due to heavy truck use that are created by these waste disposal sites have
resulted in a deep concern over the degradation of park values.'' In another section, the Report stated ``The Committee
notes that the operation of solid waste disposal sites within units of the National Park System causes deterioration
of air and water quality, increases levels of mechanical noise, and has the potential to degrade land and water areas
that are in relatively natural condition and areas containing significant cultural values, and that the operation
of such disposal sites renders adjacent lands, and waters, unfit for full public use and enjoyment.'' In light of the
Committee's broad findings concerning what may constitute natural resources affected by solid waste disposal sites,
the drafters have chosen to provide a broad definition for this term.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definition of the term ``National Park System,'' mirrors the statutory language of 16 U.S.C. 1c. The purpose in
including it here is that the term is used in the statute. Defining it in the rule clarifies the applicability of the
rule.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The definitions of the terms ``PCBs and PCB items'' and ``post closure care'' is the same as used by EPA. The terms ``PCBs
and PCB items'' are defined by regulations at 40 CFR part 761, Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) Manufacturing, Distribution
in Commerce, And Use Prohibitions. The terms ``closure'' and ``post closure care'' are described at 40 CFR part 258.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At the heart of this regulatory package are the management and control of ``solid waste.'' The National Park Service
defines the term similarly to that used in RCRA regulations at 40 CFR part 258. The broad definition of solid waste included
here is intended to ensure that all potential sources of adverse effects to National Park System units from such sources
come under the purview of the final rule. The rule also defines two classes of solid waste_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agricultural and residential_that may be exempt from the rule under clearly delineated circumstances.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the statute severely restricts the establishment of new ``(solid waste) disposal sites'' within units of
the National Park System and because the term is central to any regulatory activities under the framework of the statute,
it is defined in the rule. The definition is based on the statutory language in RCRA for the term ``disposal.'' The definition
explicitly states that such sites include land or waters where such solid waste may be placed.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule governs solid waste transfer stations but not recycling centers, sewage treatment plants, septic
systems, or facilities for managing compostible materials.

Section 6.4&blank;Solid Waste Disposal Sites Not in Operation on September 1, 1984
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The regulation permits establishing new solid waste disposal sites after September 1, 1984, within units of the National
Park System, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
only
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 with the approval of the Regional Director. This section does not apply to solid waste disposal sites in operation
on September 1, 1984.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director may approve a permit for a new solid waste disposal site only under the stringent conditions
outlined in the rule that are derived from the statute. The Act states that any new sites must be ``*&blank;*&blank;*
used only for disposal of wastes generated within that unit of the park system *&blank;*&blank;*'' This is the basis
for the first approval condition. The drafters have included the phrase ``solely from National Park Service activities''
in recognition of the fact that the Congress acknowledged that the National Park Service might need to operate solid
waste disposal sites for its own management and associated activities. The Service believes that the statutory language
``wastes generated within that unit of the park system'' was meant to convey a nexus between the disposal sites and
activities of the NPS.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second condition requires that there be no reasonable alternative for disposal outside the unit boundaries.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The third condition also is directly derived from the statute which says ``*&blank;*&blank;* so long as such site
will not degrade any of the natural and cultural resources of such park unit.'' The fourth and fifth conditions ensure
consistency and compliance with other Federal, State, and local regulatory programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sixth condition, that hazardous wastes may not be stored, handled, or disposed at solid waste disposal sites within
National Park System units, recognizes the unique resource values protected in the National Park System and the fundamental
incompatibility of the placement of hazardous wastes with protecting those resources. The final rule adds tires
to the list of wastes that may not be disposed of at a solid waste disposal site within the boundaries of a National Park
System unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that the EPA's definition of hazardous waste at 40 CFR part 261 excludes wastes generated by households (including
single and multiple residences, hotels and motels). Thus, the sixth condition does not restrict disposal of household
wastes in NPS operated or other solid waste disposal sites in National Park System units, as long as the waste results
from National Park Service activities, such as garbage collection from park/concessionaire employees' residences.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The seventh condition, that such sites be located wholly on nonfederal lands, implements the policy of the National
Park Service articulated in its 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Management Policies
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (1988), page 9:6. As a consequence, no such sites may be established or expanded onto Federal lands in a unit, except
that the NPS may establish a new solid waste disposal site on Federal lands in a park where nonfederal lands do not exist,
or are otherwise unavailable or unsuitable. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The eighth condition implements Executive Orders 11988 and 11990. The ninth and tenth conditions seek to clearly
specify precise categories of facilities and lands where solid waste disposal sites would be incompatible with NPS
management and visitor enjoyment. The eleventh condition limits the size of such sites and the twelfth condition
seeks to ensure that such sites will not degrade park resources and visitor enjoyment at a future date. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The request for a permit forms the basis for the Regional Director's evaluation of whether the conditions for approval
listed above may be met. The Act states that its general purpose is to ``protect the air, land, water, natural and cultural
values of the National Park System and the property of the United States therein.'' Section 6.4(b) of the rule specifies
the minimum amount of information necessary, in the professional judgment of the NPS, to evaluate whether the air,
land, water, and cultural and natural resources of the National Park System can be protected if a proposed operation
is permitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, &sect;6.4(c) requires that the Regional Director reject the request if the conditions for approval detailed
in paragraph (a) are not met. This section also requires that the Regional Director notify the requester of the rejection
and the reasons for the rejection. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 6.5&blank;Solid Waste Disposal Sites in Operation on September 1, 1984 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The NPS believes that solid waste disposal sites are not an appropriate use of lands within National Park System unit
boundaries. The long-term intent of the National Park Service is to eliminate, to the extent possible, such sites
from within unit boundaries. In the interim, the requirements of &sect;6.5 are designed to ensure that any solid waste
disposal sites in operation on September 1, 1984, in units of the National Park System and continuously operated since
that time meet minimum standards for operation and do not degrade park resources and values. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The term ``continuous operation'' requires clarification. The Service determines that a solid waste disposal site
existing on September 1, 1984, qualifies under &sect;6.5, if that site has accepted solid waste for disposal at least
for some portion of each year after 1984. To be in ``continuous operation'' does not require that the site receive waste
on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. Often seasonal factors, such as weather, access, and fluctuations in waste
loads require that some existing sites may be used intermittently.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The approval conditions of &sect;6.5 are designed to implement the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section of the Act that requires the Secretary to promulgate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations ``to mitigate the adverse effects of solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal sites in operation as of September 1, 1984, upon property 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the United States.'' As a result of the statutory language, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the first condition requires that there be adequate mitigation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adverse effects from the operation of the disposal site. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
second condition requires compliance with all applicable Federal, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State, and local laws and regulations. This section, like 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;6.4, requires that there be no hazardous waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at any such sites because such activities are incompatible with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the values and purpose of the National Park System and each unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thereof. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several solid waste disposal sites are currently operated by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfederal parties in units of the National Park System. Most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are on nonfederal lands within the unit boundaries, while others 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are on Federal lands within the units. The sites on Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lands often exist because of agreements made as conditions to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal acquisition of specific tracts of land. The regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not terminate any existing agreements that are in compliance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with applicable local, State, and Federal laws. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.5(c) prescribes the conditions under which the Regional Director may allow existing solid waste disposal
sites 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to continue operations. However, the NPS intends that existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste disposal sites operated by nonfederal parties will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not operate indefinitely. Under &sect;6.5(e), a site that reaches its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity may continue operation only if the site meets conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
applicable to new sites at &sect;6.4(a). For the purposes of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulations, the capacity of a solid waste disposal site is that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
area, volume, or height prescribed in the State-issued permit or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other instrument. Any proposal to extend the capacity of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing solid waste disposal site beyond that specified in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit will be treated as a proposal for a new solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site. Such a proposal is subject to the approval conditions in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;6.4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is conceivable that communities that lie wholly within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries of a unit of the National Park System may exhaust the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity of their existing solid waste disposal sites. Such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
communities may request that the Regional Director permit them to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
establish a new, or expand an existing, site within the unit. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regional Director must judge such a request under the conditions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prescribed in &sect;6.4. However, the Regional Director will judge a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for expansion of an existing site under the approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conditions of &sect;6.5(c), if the operator shows that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The solid waste is generated solely from within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries of the unit; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The operator owns or leases the nonfederal lands proposed for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expansion; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The solid waste disposal site lacks road, rail or adequate water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
access to any lands outside of the unit for all or substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
portions of the year. A substantial portion of the year consists 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of three or more consecutive months. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The principles of this section govern the NPS. Should the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPS seek to expand an existing solid waste disposal site that has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reached its capacity, such an expansion is to be judged as a ``new'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site, governed by the approval standards of &sect;6.4(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the NPS meets the first and third conditions of &sect;6.5(e)(2), the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPS may also expand an existing NPS-operated solid waste disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site that has reached its capacity, under the standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;6.5(c), rather than &sect;6.4(a). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule includes a new section (f) to address concerns about 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste incinerators and transfer stations. The proposed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
final definition of ``solid waste disposal site'' included 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incinerators. The final rule defines solid waste disposal sites to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also include transfer stations. The installation of an incinerator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or a transfer station where there was no site for solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal on September 1, 1984 is governed by &sect;6.4. Section 6.5(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
governs the continued operation of an incinerator or a transfer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
station where such a solid waste disposal site existed before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
September 1, 1984. Existing incinerators or transfer stations, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
just as any other solid waste disposal site, may continue to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dispose of solid waste within the boundaries of a unit of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Park System only after applying to the NPS under &sect;6.5(a) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and under the standards of &sect;6.5(c). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because incinerators or transfer stations generally do not reach capacity and require expansion, &sect;6.5(e)
does not apply to them. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rather &sect;6.5(e) addresses conventional land-fill solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.5(f) is needed to address the conversion of an existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
land-fill solid waste disposal site to a transfer station after the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effective date of this rule. Without &sect;6.5(f), an operator of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing solid waste disposal site, approved under &sect;6.5(c), may not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
realize that converting an existing solid waste disposal land-fill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a transfer station requires a request to the NPS Regional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Director and further NPS review and approval.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the National Park System in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thus, solid waste disposal sites on Federal or nonfederal

lands included within a unit boundaries must cease operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
immediately upon expiration of the permit or license in effect on

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (a) applies to solid waste disposal sites on both Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and nonfederal lands included within a National Park System unit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the interim, and until the expiration of the permit, permittees 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and/or operators of such sites on Federal or nonfederal lands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the boundaries must submit a permit request and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environmental report. Thus, paragraph (b) states that an operator 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wishing to continue solid waste disposal must request a permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within 180 days of the site's designation as lying within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
boundaries of a National Park System unit. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule modifies paragraph (c) to delete immediate closure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as the NPS remedy under part 6 for an operator on Federal or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
nonfederal lands who disposes of solid waste on that land without 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting NPS approval as specified in paragraph (b). The final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rule substitutes instead a broader selection of remedies and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
penalties as defined in &sect;6.12. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule modifies paragraph (d) to make clear that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while an operator of a solid waste disposal site on lands 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
System may continue to operate until the expiration of the permit 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or other license that existed on the date the lands were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incorporated into the unit, such an operator may do so, only 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insofar as such operator meets the NPS approval standards of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&sect;6.5(c).

Section 6.7&blank;Mining Wastes
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section is intended to clarify the relationship between the regulations governing solid waste disposal and
existing regulations at 36 CFR part 9, Minerals Management, that govern mineral operations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.7 (b) and (c) address solid waste disposal by persons conducting mineral operations on the date these regulations
become effective. Section 6.7(b) addresses existing mineral operations within a unit of the National Park System
that are not governed by an NPS-approved part 9 plan of operations or terms of a Federal mineral lease. Such an operation
may continue to dispose of solid waste at a site within a unit only after following the procedures and conditions prescribed
in &sect;6.5, posting financial assurance prescribed by the Regional Director, and obtaining a permit from the Regional
Director under &sect;6.9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.7(c) provides that an existing mineral operation, if governed by a plan of operations approved under 36
CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal mineral lease, may continue to operate a solid waste disposal site within a unit of
the National Park System pursuant to the approved plan of operations or lease. In approving the plan of operations,
the Regional Director, under part 9, should have already prescribed conditions to ``*&blank;*&blank;* mitigate
the adverse effects of solid waste disposal on the property of the United States *&blank;*&blank;*'' associated
with the operation. Congress prescribed this standard as the basis for regulations that govern all existing solid
waste disposal sites.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.7(c) makes clear that where an existing mineral operation is governed by 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal
mineral lease, the Regional Director's approval of the plan of operations constitutes the permit for operation of
a solid waste disposal site in connection with the mineral operation. Financial assurance is not required, if a bond
has been posted under 36 CFR part 9 or the Bureau of Land Management regulations that govern Federal mineral lessees.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final regulations allow new solid waste disposal sites by mineral operators within a unit only under the conditions
that Congress prescribed for solid waste disposal at 16 U.S.C. 460
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
l
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&hyph;22. Thus, final &sect;6.7(d) addresses solid waste disposal sites operated by persons proposing mineral
operations beginning after the effective date of these regulations. Such an operator is governed by the conditions
at &sect;6.4(a) that preclude any new solid waste disposal sites within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park
System, unless the waste is generated solely by National Park Service activities. Thus, persons who begin mineral
operations after the effective date of the regulations, as all other persons, could not operate a new solid waste disposal
site within the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System. Among the alternatives available to mineral operators
are disposing of the solid waste in appropriate facilities outside the unit boundaries, or in an existing solid waste
disposal site in a unit, whose continued operation has been approved by the Regional Director under &sect;6.5 and
permitted under &sect;6.9.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.7(d) applies to establishment of a solid waste disposal site by a prospective operator, whether the operator
is governed by regulations at 36 CFR part 9 or the terms of a Federal mineral lease. Nonetheless, the Regional Director
must ensure that all persons, including those beginning mineral operations within a unit, obey the prohibition on
establishing a new solid waste disposal site on all lands within a unit's boundaries. This task will be relatively
simple where an operator is governed by 36 CFR part 9 or a Federal mineral lease. Where an operator is not so governed,
the Regional Director must inform the operator of, and enforce, the conditions that prohibit a new solid waste disposal
site. To ease the regulatory burden on a mineral operator, nothing in this part prohibits the temporary storage, or
stockpiling for return, or the return of mining overburden to the mine site for reclamation purposes. Such activity
does not constitute creation of a solid waste disposal site and will not be governed by the need to request or possess
a permit, the conditions at &sect;6.4 and &sect;6.5, or the financial assurance requirements of &sect;6.9. This
exception applies only to mining overburden that is not hazardous under EPA regulations at 40 CFR part 261. However,
a mineral operator commencing operations after the effective date of this final rule will not be permitted to permanently
abandon spoil or overburden on their lands, including on patented claims, or other nonfederal lands in a unit. Such
an action constitutes creation of a new ``solid waste disposal site'' which Congress prohibited within the boundaries
of a National Park System unit. The Service recognizes that this requirement may increase the costs of conducting
mining in parks. However, the cost of conducting mining must also include the cost of reclaiming the solid waste remaining
after mining is completed. The NPS cannot reasonably implement congressional intent to prohibit new solid waste
disposal sites in National Park System units, and then allow mining operators to establish such sites in parks in connection
with mining.

Section 6.8&blank;National Park Service Solid Waste Responsibilities
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (a) prohibits the disposal of solid waste in NPS-operated solid waste disposal sites by persons other than
those engaged in National Park Service activities. ``National Park Service activities'' are defined in &sect;6.3
to include NPS contractors, concessionaires or commercial use licensees. In several instances, persons other than
contractors, concessionaires, or commercial use licensees now dispose of solid waste in NPS operated solid waste
disposal sites on Federal lands. This is an inappropriate use of Federal park lands that the regulations terminate
one year after the effective date of these regulations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (b) directs the NPS to set up special collection program to remove harmful substances from the household
waste stream where appropriate. While wastes generated by households (including hotels and motels) are not hazardous,
they may be harmful to NPS resources. Therefore the NPS, under &sect;6.8, will establish a collection program to remove
such materials from the waste stream in units where the NPS operates a solid waste disposal site. The proposed rule
required that such collections be conducted every six months. The final rule requires it once each year. Each such
park has the latitude to establish a collection program that best meets its circumstances, ranging from a one-day
collection of certain wastes only (used oil, paints, thinners, etc.) to a continually open collection site for all
harmful wastes generated by park residents.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Paragraph (c) requires that the NPS strictly adhere to the regulations at 40 CFR part 244, Solid Waste Management Guidelines
for Beverage Containers. While some units may not be aware of the requirements at 40 CFR part 244 for deposit systems
on Federal facilities, nonetheless the requirements are longstanding. Note that the regulations require (not simply
``recommend'') that Federal facilities maintain deposit and return systems on containers in which ``carbonated
beverages'' are sold. Such containers may be plastic, glass, aluminum or steel. Parks, such as Grand Canyon National
Park, that have voluntary recycling programs are not exempt from final &sect;6.8(c). Mandatory deposit and return
systems are not replaced by voluntary recycling efforts. Rather these two approaches complement each other. As part
of its environmental leadership responsibilities, the NPS seeks to address the solid waste issue with several tools,
including mandatory deposit and return systems for carbonated beverage containers sold by facilities on Federal
lands in units of the National Park System. Individual units that propose not to implement 40 CFR part 244 shall maintain
deposit and return systems while a fully-documented request for non-implementation is being considered.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The final rule inserts a new subsection (d) at &sect;6.8 to address Executive Order 12873, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federal Acquisition, Recycling and Waste Prevention. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
That order mandates that all Federal agencies ``shall incorporate waste prevention and recycling in the agency's
daily operations and work.'' This requirement governs not only the NPS but also NPS concessionaires, commercial
use licensees and contractors.

Section 6.9&blank;Permits
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The final rule requires that a person proposing to continue, or begin operating a solid waste disposal site within
the boundaries of a unit of the National Park System must possess a permit issued under this part. The regulations exempt
only two classes of persons operating solid waste disposal sites from this permit requirement. They are persons who
reside or farm within a park under &sect;6.2(c) and existing mineral operators described by &sect;6.7(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Residents under &sect;6.2(c) do not require a permit and the mineral operator's permit consists of an NPS-approved
plan of operations or Federal lease terms. Also note that &sect;6.2(c)(3) and &sect;6.7(e) exclude some substances
from the ambit of these regulations under certain conditions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This section also governs the issuing of a permit for the operation of a solid waste disposal site and outlines the contents
of such permits. Section 6.9(b) requires that the Regional Director comply with the National Environmental Policy
Act (NEPA) and other pertinent laws and executive orders before issuing a permit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director may find that a proposal meets the conditions under which the NPS may approve a new, or continued
operation of an existing, site. If a proposal meets the conditions, the Regional Director shall then determine, through
preparation of an environmental assessment, whether the Service's approval constitutes a major Federal agency
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. When the Regional Director finds such an effect,
the NPS will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement on the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 6.9(d) makes clear that the issuance of a Special Use Permit is the method by which the Regional Director approves
a request and environmental report, and provides that the authority to issue a permit resides with the Regional Director.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Paragraph (e) sets forth the minimum requirements a permit may prescribe for operating a solid waste disposal site.
The requirements are aimed at reducing the potential adverse effects attributable to the operation of such sites
on the property of the United States.

Section 6.10&blank;Financial Assurance
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section prescribes the procedures for financial assurance from a solid waste disposal site operator in a unit
of the National Park System.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The regulations at 40 CFR part 258 require that an operator of a solid waste disposal site for household and certain
other commercial and industrial solid wastes (not including hazardous wastes) must provide an estimate of costs
related to closure and post-closure care responsibilities of the site, and establish sufficient financial assurance
to meet those responsibilities. The NPS sees no need to require added financial assurance, in the form of cash or surety
bond guaranteeing payment or performance, where the operator has provided such a bond under regulations at 40 CFR
258.74(b). Nor will the NPS require financial assurance from an owner or operator of a site that is a State entity whose
debts and liabilities are the debts and liabilities of a State. There is also an exception that may apply to mineral
operators under &sect;6.7(c).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NPS will require financial assurance when issuing a permit for a new, or continued operation of an existing, solid
waste disposal site if the operator has not posted a bond under 40 CFR 258.74(b).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the rule clarifies that operating a solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal site within a unit of the National Park System without a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permit is prohibited. Operating a site in violation of a term or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
condition of a permit, or in violation of 40 CFR parts 257 or 258, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or in violation of the equivalent State law or regulation is also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prohibited. Violations of these provisions subject operators to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the penalty provisions of 36 CFR 1.3 and/or, where applicable, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
revocation of the permit and/or forfeiture of the bond or security 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deposit. These penalties apply to operators on nonfederal lands

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
), the NPS has prepared an environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment (EA) of these regulations. The EA examines whether the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the regulations will be a major Federal action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that would have a significant effect on the quality of the human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
environment, requiring the preparation of an environmental impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement. The EA was available for public inspection and comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at the National Park Service Office of Environmental Quality, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
located in the Department of Interior Building in Washington, DC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a period running concurrently with the comment period for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed regulations. The Director of the NPS has signed a Finding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of No Significant Impact (FONSI) declaring the implementation of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this regulation not to be a significant Federal action. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the NPS is requested to perform a regulatory flexibility analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for all rules that may have a significant impact on a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of small entities. The NPS has determined that this action 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities since the rule deals with the location of future solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal sites and the number of existing solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal sites is small. Consequently, there is no necessity for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a regulatory flexibility analysis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under Executive Order 12866. The NPS has reviewed this rule as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
directed by Executive Order 12360, ``Government Actions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interference with Constitutionally Protected Property Rights,'' to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine if this rule has ``policies that have takings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implications.'' The NPS has determined that this rule does not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
takings implications because the rule will not deny any private 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
property owner all beneficial use of their land, nor will it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significantly reduce their land's value.

(a) The operator of a solid waste disposal site in operation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as of September 1, 1984, within the boundaries of a unit of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
National Park System, having been in continuous operation on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
January 23, 1995, and who wishes to remain in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operation, must submit to the proper Superintendent for review by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Regional Director, within 180 calendar days of January 23, 1995, a permit request and an environmental 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
report as described in &sect;6.4(b) (1)&hyph;(9). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Any operator who fails to submit a request as described in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (a) of this section will not be allowed to continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations and must immediately fulfill all applicable closure and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
post-closure care requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The Regional Director may approve a request to allow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the continued use of a solid waste disposal site only if the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operator has shown and the Regional Director finds that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Adverse effects resulting from leachate, noise, odor, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vehicular traffic, litter and other activities upon natural and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

(x) Tires; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The proposed closure and post-closure care is sufficient 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to protect the resources of the National Park System unit from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
degradation; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The site conforms to all of the restrictions and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria applicable to the site under 40 CFR 257.3 and 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
part 258, or where applicable, 40 CFR part 240, Guidelines for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Thermal Processing of Solid Waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the environmental report do not meet the conditions for approval 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, the Regional Director 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall reject the request and notify the proposed operator of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons for the rejection. Within 90 calendar days of such notice, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the operator of the solid waste disposal site must cease disposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of solid waste at the site. The operator may resume disposing of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solid waste only upon submission and approval of a permit request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and environmental report that the Regional Director determines meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Site expansions. (1) A request for an existing solid waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal site to continue operations by expanding its capacity, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laterally or vertically, is considered a request for a new solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste disposal site and is subject to the conditions of &sect;6.4(a), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) A request for an existing solid waste disposal site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to continue operations by expanding its capacity, laterally or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
vertically, will be judged by the approval conditions of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
paragraph (c) of this section if the operator shows that: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The solid waste is generated solely from sources 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
within the boundaries of the unit; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The area proposed for site expansion encompasses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
only nonfederal lands owned or leased by the operator; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) the solid waste disposal site lacks road, rail, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or adequate water access to any lands outside the unit for all or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substantial portions of the year.

is not described in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section must file with the Regional Director a suitable performance
bond with satisfactory surety, payable to the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary's designee. The bond must
be conditioned upon faithful compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and the permit requirements as
approved. When bonds are to serve as security, an operator must provide a power of attorney to the Secretary or the Secretary's
designee. The bond must be issued by a surety company listed and approved by the Department of the Treasury. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In lieu of a performance bond, an operator may deposit with the Secretary or the Secretary's designee cash or negotiable
bonds of the United States Government. The cash deposit or the market value of such securities must be at least equal
to the required sum of the bond(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) The bond or security deposit will be established by the Regional Director in an amount equal to the estimated cost
to accomplish all closure and post-closure care requirements as described in 40 CFR part 258, subpart F, but in no case
less than $25,000. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) The responsibility and liability of the operator (and the surety, if any) under the bond or security deposit must
continue until the Regional Director determines that closure and post- closure care have been completed in accordance
with the permit requirements. No portion of the performance bond or security deposit may be released until such a determination
has been made. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Within 30 calendar days after the Regional Director determines that all closure and post-closure care requirements
have been successfully completed according to the permit, the Regional Director will notify the operator (and the
surety, if any) that liability under the bond or security deposit has been terminated and the bond or security deposit
released.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 International Package Consignment Service (IPCS) is an international mail service designed for mail order companies
sending merchandise packages to other countries. The service will be available initially to Japan; Canada will be
added as a destination country in the near future. If feasible, other destination countries will be added as customer
needs dictate. To use IPCS, a customer will be required to mail at least 25,000 packages in 1 year to each country to which
it wants to use the service, and to agree to link its information systems with the Postal Service's so that the Postal
Service can extract certain information about the contents of the customer's packages for customs clearance and
other purposes. The implementation of IPCS will benefit U.S. mail order companies and other customers that export
goods by making it easier and less costly to do so; and all other users of the Postal Service by increasing the total contribution
to fixed costs realized by the Postal Service from its international operations. Interim implementing regulations
have been developed and are set forth below for comment and suggested revision prior to adoption in final form.

I. Introduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
With the exception of its International Surface Air Lift (ISAL) and International Priority Airmail (IPA) services
for small packets, which have 4-pound weight limits, and VALUEPOST/CANADA service for small packets, which has a
2-pound weight limit, the Postal Service currently does not offer any bulk international service for customers sending
packages containing merchandise to other countries. As a result, if those customers want to accomplish delivery
through the mail, their only option is to use one of the Postal Service's single-piece international services: Air
Parcel Post, Surface Parcel Post, or Express Mail International Service (EMS). These services are available to customers
mailing as little as one package from anywhere in the United States and are designed and priced accordingly. They provide
the features generally desired by household and small business mailers but do not necessarily provide the features
needed by medium- or large-size business mailers that actively solicit customers in other countries and require
a reliable and cost-effective means of sending large volumes of merchandise from the United States to their international
customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
During the past few years, many customers that traditionally have used international mail to send merchandise packages
to other countries have sought more convenient and/or less costly delivery methods. This has been especially true
for customers sending packages to Canada, where the combination of relatively cumbersome customs treatment for
U.S.-origin international mail and Canada Post Corporation's practice of encouraging U.S. businesses to freight
their merchandise packages to Canada and enter them as domestic mail has caused the Postal Service's existing services
to appear increasingly unattractive as delivery methods. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two factors in particular make customs clearance of U.S.-origin mail in Canada cumbersome for companies sending
merchandise packages. First, the value threshold at which Revenue Canada rates inbound merchandise packages for
duties and taxes is lower than the corresponding threshold used by most other industrialized nations' customs agencies.
Thus, a relatively high proportion of merchandise packages mailed from the United States to Canada are assessed for
duties and taxes. Second, as happens generally with international mail, any duties and taxes that have been assessed
are collected from the addressee at the time of delivery. However, in the case of Canada, Canada Post Corporation charges
the addressee a customs collection fee of $5 Canadian. In contrast, merchandise packages that clear Canadian customs
as freight can be delivered to the addressee completely prepaid, without the need to collect duties, taxes, and fees
at the time of delivery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, customers exporting merchandise to Japan have seen their businesses there detrimentally affected
by the costs they must incur to send merchandise from the United States to Japan. Mail order companies that pass their
delivery costs directly on to their Japanese customers generally are less likely to receive orders as those costs
increase. As a result, even those customers that have continued to use the Postal Service to send merchandise packages
to Japan are continually searching for better and cheaper delivery methods.

Section 403(b)(2) of the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U.S.C. 403(b)(2), makes it the responsibility of the Postal
Service ``to provide types of mail service to meet the needs of different categories of mail and mail users.'' One of
the most important manifestations of this responsibility in the international area are services that enhance the
ability of U.S. companies to do business in other countries. That can be accomplished both by simplifying the process
those companies use to prepare their packages for mailing and by reducing the costs those companies incur to mail merchandise
to other countries. However, the Postal Service's existing international services for merchandise packages require
those companies to pay the same postage rates as all other customers pay even though very different Postal Service
operations may be involved.

II. International Package Consignment Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Rationale 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order more closely to meet the needs of mail order companies and other customers that send merchandise packages
from the United States to multiple international addressees, the Postal Service is implementing a new international
service, International Package Consignment Service (IPCS). Initially, the service will be available only to Japan.
The Postal Service anticipates offering IPCS to Canada in the near future. To the extent feasible, the Postal Service
will expand the service to include other destination countries in response to requests from customers. In this regard,
the Postal Service specifically requests comments from customers regarding the need for IPCS to destination countries
other than Japan and Canada. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to making it easier and less costly for U.S. mail order companies and other customers to export goods, the
implementation of IPCS will benefit all users of the Postal Service's other services by decreasing the total revenues
that the Postal Service needs to recover from them. Offering IPCS makes all Postal Service customers better off because
the additional business generated not only covers the extra variable costs it causes, but also enables the Postal
Service to recover its fixed costs from a larger base of customers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Qualifying Criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A customer that wants to use IPCS will be required to enter into a service agreement with the Postal Service providing
for the following. First, the customer must commit to mail at least 25,000 packages through the service during the
next 12 months to each destination country to which it wants to use IPCS. Second, the customer must designate the Postal
Service as its carrier of choice to each destination country to which it wants to use IPCS. Third, the customer must
agree to link its information systems with the Postal Service's so that (1) the Postal Service and the customer can
exchange data transmissions concerning the customer's packages, and (2) by scanning the customer-provided barcode
on each package, the Postal Service can extract, on an as-needed basis, certain information about the package. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In general, the information that must be made available to the Postal Service includes: the order number; the package
identification number; the buyer's name and address; the recipient's name and address; the total weight of the package;
the total value of the package; the number of items in the package; and, for each item in the package, its SKU number,
its value, and its country of origin. The exact information required will vary, depending on the destination country
to which the packages are sent. In practice, this requirement means that the customer will have to begin the necessary
systems work by the time it begins using IPCS, and then will have to assist the Postal Service in completing and maintaining
the information systems linkages. The Postal Service will use the extracted information to prepare any necessary
customs forms and package labels, to accept the customer's mail and verify postage payment automatically, and to
provide user-friendly tracking and tracing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to these required commitments, which must appear in all IPCS service agreements, arrangements between
the Postal Service and the customer that are technical in nature also may appear in the IPCS service agreement. For
instance, the service agreement may describe the EDI or proprietary file format that will be used to transmit data
between the customer and the Postal Service, as well as the frequency and schedule of transmissions. Similarly, the
service agreement may describe the formats and frequencies for any exception and performance reports that the Postal
Service will provide to the customer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IPCS service agreement will not define the basic terms and conditions of the service, or the rates that the customer
will pay. As discussed below, IPCS is not a customized service. All customers that use IPCS will be offered the same
rates and will receive the same delivery services. New regulations in International Mail Manual (IMM) 620 establish
IPCS and make it generally available at published rates.

III. IPCS to Japan 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. JFK Processing Facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because of (1) the greater availability of direct air transportation to Japan from JFK International Airport compared
with that available from other airports; (2) the efficiencies created by the Postal Service's being able to process
all IPCS mail to Japan at a single facility designed for that purpose; (3) the efficiencies created by the Postal Service's
being able to dispatch all IPCS mail to Japan from a single facility designed for that purpose; and (4) general operational
and managerial considerations, the Postal Service has determined that all IPCS mail to Japan should be processed
at, and dispatched from, a dedicated facility located at JFK International Airport (the JFK Processing Facility).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the plant at which the customer's packages originate is located within 500 miles of JFK International Airport,
the Postal Service will accept the packages at the plant and transport them by truck to the JFK Processing Facility
according to a schedule agreed upon by the Postal Service and the customer. If the customer's plant is located more
than 500 miles from JFK International Airport, the customer will be required to present the packages to the Postal
Service for verification at the plant and transport them as a drop shipment to the JFK Processing Facility according
to a schedule agreed upon by the Postal Service and the customer. The Postal Service is imposing this requirement because
the IPCS customer will be in a better position than the Postal Service to arrange for cost-effective air or long-haul
surface transportation that meets the customer's package preparation schedule and other operational requirements.
Although the Postal Service initially will require all IPCS mail to Japan to be brought to the JFK Processing Facility,
the Postal Service specifically requests comments from customers regarding the need for an additional processing
site in another part of the country, such as the Seattle or San Francisco metropolitan areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Customs Forms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Packages mailed to Japan through IPCS will not be required to bear customs forms when they are tendered to the Postal
Service. After scanning the customer-printed barcode on each package and correlating it with the package-specific
information transmitted by the customer, the Postal Service will print the necessary customs forms and then affix
them to the customer's packages as part of the processing operation at the JFK Processing Facility. However, during
the interim period in which the Postal Service and the customer are working together to establish the information
systems linkages to enable the Postal Service to accomplish this, the customer will be required to prepare the necessary
customs forms on its own and affix the forms to the packages before tendering them to the Postal Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Delivery Options 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Within the framework of IPCS to Japan, the Postal Service will offer three delivery options: Express Service, Standard
Air Service, and Economy Air Service. While the weight limit for Express Service and Standard Air Service packages
will be 44 pounds, the weight limit for Economy Air Service packages will be 4 pounds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Express Service will be the fastest option and will provide tracking and tracing and insurance at no additional cost.
The Postal Service will transport Express Service packages to Japan by air, where they will receive special handling
by Japan Post and expedited delivery. Each package sent by this option must bear a label identifying it as an Express
Service package (Label 11&hyph;B, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Express Mail Service Post Office to Addressee, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
or an alternative label acceptable to Japan Post). Before or after scanning the customer-printed barcode on each
package and correlating it with the package-specific information transmitted by the customer, the Postal Service
will prepare the necessary labels and affix them to the customer's Express Service packages as part of the processing
operation at the JFK Processing Facility. However, during the interim period in which the Postal Service and the customer
are working together to establish the information systems linkages to enable the Postal Service to accomplish this,
the customer will be able to use Express Service by preparing the necessary labels on its own and affixing the labels
to the packages before tendering them to the Postal Service. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Standard Air Service will be the next fastest delivery option and will provide confirmation of dispatch from the United
States.

The base rates for the three delivery options are set forth below. The base rates may be reduced by any or all of four additive
annual discounts depending on how many packages the customer mails to Japan through IPCS. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For each delivery option, the Postal Service will charge the base rates, at 1-pound increments, for the first 100,000
packages mailed by the customer during the 12-month period. Once the customer has mailed 100,000 packages, postage
for the customer's next 150,000 packages will be reduced by 4.75% from the base rates. Packages mailed through any
of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's meeting the 100,000-package threshold. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the customer has mailed 250,000 packages during the 12-month period, postage for the customer's next 250,000
packages will be reduced by an additional 5.75% taking into account the first discount. That is, postage will be calculated
for these 150,000 packages by calculating postage at the base rates, then reducing it by 4.75%, and then reducing that
total by a further 5.75%. Again, packages mailed through any of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's
meeting the 250,000-package threshold.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Once the customer has mailed 500,000 packages during the 12-month period, postage for the customer's next 500,000
packages will be reduced by an additional 6.00% taking into account the first two discounts. That is, postage will
be calculated for these 500,000 packages by calculating postage at the base rates, then reducing it by 4.75%, then
reducing that total by a further 5.75%, and then reducing that total by a further 6.00%. Again, packages mailed through

Once the customer has mailed 1,000,000 packages during the 12-month period, postage for the customer's remaining
packages will be reduced by an additional 6.25% taking into account the first three discounts. That is, postage will
be calculated for the remaining packages by calculating postage at the base rates, then reducing it by 4.75%, then
reducing that total by a further 5.75%, then reducing that total by a further 6.00%, and then reducing that total by
6.25%. Again, packages mailed through any of the three delivery options will count toward the customer's meeting

IV. Legal Issues 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
On May 16, 1994, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware ruled against the Postal Service in the case of

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
UPS Worldwide Forwarding, Inc. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
v. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
U.S. Postal Service 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
and enjoined it from offering International Customized Mail (ICM) service. ICM was a new service in which the Postal
Service negotiated service features and rates with qualifying customers that entered into service agreements.
To qualify for ICM service, a customer had to be capable of annually tendering to the Postal Service at least 1 million
pounds of international mail or paying at least $2 million in international postage, and of tendering all of its mail
to the Postal Service at one location. ICM enabled the Postal Service to provide customer-specific service offerings
at rates that reflected the specific costs incurred in providing the service. Rates and services in any ICM service
agreement were available to any customer qualifying for the service that sent mail with similar characteristics
and that undertook the same preparation and work-sharing specified in the service agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The District Court first held that UPS, as a competitor of the Postal Service, had standing to challenge ICM service
even though it did not allege that ICM rates were predatory. The District Court then concluded that ICM rates violated
section 403(b)(2) of the Postal Reorganization Act (Act), 39 U.S.C. 403(b)(2), because ICM agreements were with
individual mailers and section 403(b)(2) limits the Postal Service to providing services and establishing rates
for categories of mail and mailers consisting of more than one mailer. The District Court then concluded that ICM rates
were unduly discriminatory because a mailer had to be capable of posting 1 million pounds of mail or paying $2 million
annually in postage to be eligible for the service, but did not have to tender those minimum volumes to the Postal Service
to receive ICM service. Under those circumstances, the Court concluded, different mailers could be paying different
rates for similar mail and mail services. The District Court then concluded that ICM rates inequitably apportioned
the costs of postal services because smaller mailers that could meet the minimum capabilities requirements did not
have access to ICM rates even if they mailed similar quantities of mail. Finally, the District Court concluded that
ICM rates were illegal because under section 407 of the Act, 39 U.S.C. 407, the Postal Service had to obtain the consent
of the President to establish international rates, and the Postal Service had not obtained Presidential consent
for ICM rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service is appealing the District Court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and
is confident that it will prevail on appeal. Notwithstanding the appeal, however, the Postal Service recognizes
that it is obligated to comply with the terms of the District Court's injunction as long as it is in effect, and that IPCS
may be challenged under the same legal theories that UPS used to challenge ICM service. Consequently, when designing
IPCS, the Postal Service avoided those features of ICM service that the District Court found to be inconsistent with
the Act. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, IPCS will be available, under the same terms and conditions and at the same rates, to any customer that can meet
the qualifying criteria. All customers that use IPCS to mail packages to a particular country will receive the same
delivery services. Further, all IPCS customers will pay the same base rates and will be able to take advantage of the
same volume discounts. Thus, all customers using IPCS to Japan, even those that eventually mail 500,000 or more packages
during a 12-month period, will pay the same rates for their first 100,000 packages. Similarly, all customers will
pay the same rates for their next 150,000 packages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, the volume-based qualifying criteria will be based on the actual number of packages that the customer will
tender, not on the customer's potential volume. In selecting 25,000 packages per 12 months per country as the qualifying
threshold, the Postal Service struck a balance between its desire to provide the service to as many customers as practicable
and its need to be able to recover the costs associated with providing the service, including the costs of establishing
the necessary information system linkages. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In light of the foregoing, the implementation of IPCS is fully consistent not only with the provisions of the Act that
govern international rates and services, but also with the District Court's decision in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Accordingly, the Postal Service hereby adopts IPCS to Japan, on an interim basis, at the rates set forth in the schedule
above. Although 39 U.S.C. 407 does not require advance notice and opportunity for submission of comments, and the
Postal Service is exempted by 39 U.S.C. 410(a) from the advance notice requirements of the Administrative Procedure
Act regarding proposed rulemaking (5 U.S.C. 553), the Postal Service invites interested persons to submit written
data, views, or arguments concerning the interim rule.

the necessary customs forms based on the package-specific information transmitted by the mailer, and affixes them
to the packages. However, during the interim period in which the Postal Service and the mailer are establishing the
information systems linkages to enable the Postal Service to accomplish this, the mailer is required to affix the
appropriate customs forms to the packages, as follows:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This final rule amends Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards concerning the maximum weight of an automation-compatible
barcoded letter-size mailpiece. Subject to additional preparation requirements, certain barcoded mailpieces
weighing more than 3 ounces will be acceptable at Barcoded rates for a trial period of up to 1 year.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On July 14, 1994, the Postal Service published for public comment in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 (59 FR 35873&hyph;35875) a proposed rule to amend the Domestic Mail Manual (DMM) standards for the physical characteristics
of automation-compatible barcoded letter-size mail. For a period of up to 1 year, the Postal Service proposed to conduct
a live test of barcoded bulk third-class regular rate letter mail weighing between 3.0 and 3.3067 ounces, and First-,
second-, and bulk third-class nonprofit rate letter mail weighing between 3.0 and 3.3363 ounces.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the Postal Service believes that this mail can benefit from barcoding (as the means of moving this mail into
an automated processing environment), it also believes that this benefit can be achieved only under specific standards
governing the construction and preparation of this ``heavy letter mail.'' Thus, the proposed new standards required
that each ``heavy letter'' mailpiece comply with the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Be part of a mailing that is 100 percent delivery point barcoded. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Have the barcode in the address block. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Be in an envelope that has no open windows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Not be bound or have stiff enclosures. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service proposed to set the maximum weight for Barcoded rate letter-size mailpieces at 3.3363 ounces (or
3.3067 ounces for pieces mailed at regular bulk third-class rates), the break points between the bulk third-class
minimum per-piece rates and the two-part piece/pound rates then in effect. (These values increase to 3.3376 and 3.3071
ounces, respectively, when R94 rates are implemented on January 1, 1995. The increased values are used in the text
and DMM revisions appearing below.) If the maximum weight were set at 3.3 ounces, a small amount of letter-size minimum
per-piece mail would be excluded from the rates otherwise available to letter mail. For simplicity and consistency,
the maximum weight for First- and second-class barcoded letter mail was also proposed to be set at 3.3376 ounces. For
regular bulk third-class rate only, the maximum is set at 3.3071 ounces, which is its ``break point.'' If the proposed
test or changes in the ``break point'' indicate that this alignment is not in the best interest of the Postal Service,
the maximum weight will be adjusted accordingly.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service received 14 comments on the proposed rule, including three from mailing industry trade associations,
one from a mailing-related business, and 10 from companies and corporations. The specific topics covered in those
comments are discussed below.

Consideration of Letter Mail Heavier Than 3.0 Ounces for Automation Rates

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All 14 commenters expressed support for the Postal Service's efforts to conduct live tests of barcoded letters weighing
between 3.0 and 3.3376 ounces (or 3.3071 ounces for third-class regular rate mail). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One commenter encouraged consideration for a much higher weight limit. The Postal Service believes that for the heavy
letter-mail test period, the maximum weight should be limited to 3.3376 ounces. Previous controlled tests conducted
by the Postal Service revealed that increased problems (such as damage, jams, and throughput) arose or worsened with
mail heavier than 3.3376 ounces. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Another commenter (a mailing company) supported the Postal Service's effort but expressed doubts that presort service
bureaus would accept address-block barcoded heavy letter mail to run through their automated equipment because
of possible machine jams, lowered machine throughput, and the requirement for 100 percent delivery point barcoding.
Participation in this test is voluntary. Although the Postal Service realizes that some companies will be unable
to participate, it does not believe that the objectives of the test can be served if the test criteria are altered. The
Postal Service believes that it will be able, under the requirements adopted by this rule, to obtain sufficient participation
to conduct a valid test.

Requirement for Enveloped Mailpieces

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Two comments were received opposing the proposed standard that all heavy letter mail be in envelopes. One commenter
thought that the heavy letter mail tests should be conducted using mailpieces constructed under current standards
and encouraged the use of tabbed catalogs during the trial period. One commenter recommended the inclusion of self-mailers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service believes that only enveloped mail should be tested as part of this trial and that the proposed restriction
on self-mailers and on bound or booklet-type mail should remain. The preliminary tests were performed only on enveloped
mailpieces that were heavier than 3.0 ounces and not on tabbed catalogs. The Postal Service has recently tested tabbed
catalogs weighing 3.3 ounces on its automated equipment and found that such pieces caused equipment jams and were
more susceptible to damage. As a result, the Postal Service believes that it is prudent to proceed to test only enveloped
mail. Accordingly, that portion of the proposed rule that specified only enveloped mail would be eligible for the
test will be retained in the final rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In allowing only enveloped mail in the proposed test, the Postal Service is seeking to evaluate the performance of
heavy letter mail having the best opportunity for successful automated processing, insofar as that can be predicted
by physical criteria. Accordingly, in addition to retaining its focus on enveloped mail, the Postal Service also
wishes to point out that by including heavy letter mail in the general category of automation-compatible mail for
the test period, it is expecting that this mail will be prepared in trays, as is currently the case for other automation-compatible
letter mail. Although the proposed rule did not explicitly discuss this point, the Postal Service finds it appropriate
to emphasize this point in the final rule as a logical corollary to the temporary transfer of heavy letter mail into
the automation-compatible category.

Four comments were received opposing the standard that heavy letter mail not be in envelopes with open windows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service has conducted tests in which preliminary results indicate that open windows on mailpieces above
3.0 ounces have a greater tendency to snag on automated processing equipment. The Postal Service is also concerned
about damage to the heavy letter mailpieces with open windows and other mail that might be adjacent to it during automated
processing. Thus, the Postal Service has determined to retain the proposed prohibition of open-windowed envelopes
in the final rule.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Nine comments were received opposing the standard that mailings of heavy letter pieces be 100 percent delivery point
barcoded. Eight commenters stated that 100 percent delivery point barcoding would discourage or inhibit them from
participating in the test and requested that barcoding levels be set at the 85 percent level now generally applicable
to Barcoded rate letter mailings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seven commenters stated that 100 percent delivery point barcoding would require splitting their mailings into two
streams_one delivery point barcoded stream and one not. Several commenters stated that splitting the mail into two
such streams would negate the benefits of the automation rate. One commenter stated that his company already splits
the mail into two streams and meets the 100 percent requirement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four commenters stated that no major mailer today has been able to ZIP+4 code 100 percent of its mailing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service believes that the requirement for 100 percent delivery point barcoding of all heavy letter mail
is necessary. As part of an effort to get a barcode on all mail, the Postal Service routinely processes on an optical
character reader (OCR) all mailpieces rejected from barcode sorters in an effort to read the delivery address and
print a barcode in the lower right corner of the mailpiece. However, heavy letter mail will not run through OCRs; attempts
to process and barcode such mail on an OCR revealed that significant damage occurred to the heavy letter pieces and
that any barcodes printed in the barcode clear zone by the OCR were often unreadable. (The increased thickness caused
the bottom edges of the heavy letter mail envelopes to be rounded and to buckle when bent. Because of the curvature and
irregular surface created by the rounding and buckling of the heavy mailpiece, barcodes printed in the lower right
corner of such mailpieces by the OCR were outside the working specifications of postal barcode readers and, as a result,
useless for automated processing.) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The additional OCR processing of non-delivery point barcoded heavy letter mail, the labor to repair damaged pieces,
and the ensuing manual or mechanized handling of that mail amount to unreasonable additional costs for the Postal
Service, well beyond that appropriate for Barcoded rate mail. As a result, the proposed rule's provisions for a 100
percent delivery point barcoded mailstream for heavy letter mail will be retained in the final rule.

Follow Current Postal Requirements for Heavy Letter Mail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Six commenters stated that the heavy letter mail trial period should be run using the current standards for automation
rate mail and that no additional constraints should be imposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service believes that modification of the current standards for automation-compatible mail are necessary
based on the results of controlled tests already performed on heavy letter mail as previously described. If appropriate
additional standards are not imposed on heavy letter mail, consistent with the results of earlier tests, the Postal
Service believes that live mail testing will have no chance for success and that greater customer dissatisfaction
would result than may occur with the heavy letter mail standards adopted by this rule.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The section referred to by the commenter applies only to lower right corner barcode windows. The Postal Service does
not intend to add new standards to DMM C840.6.0, only to limit the use of lower right corner barcode windows to mailpieces
weighing 3.0 ounces or less.

Requirements for Identification of Test Mail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Before the Postal Service can determine whether a permanent increase in the maximum weight for barcoded letter mail
is appropriate, it must determine whether the impact of heavy letter mail is acceptable. Accurate evaluation of the
test data will depend in part on the Postal Service's ability to identify, measure, and monitor heavy letter mail as
it enters and moves through the mailstream. Accordingly, test participants will be required to take specific measures
to identify heavy letter mail to enable the Postal Service to gather the necessary data for this test. Although not
specifically discussed in the proposed rule, the importance of mail identification became evident as the comments
were being reviewed, and provisions requiring identification are being introduced in the final rule as reasonable
and logical elements of the test process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Specifically, the Postal Service will require that each container of heavy mail be clearly identified when submitted
by the mailer. Pallets, general purpose mail containers, and other similar equipment used to transport trays of heavy
letter mail will require labels (placards) bearing the words ``HEAVY LETTER MAIL'' in letters not less than 1/2 inch
high. These labels must be white or light-colored stock, not smaller than 8 by 11 inches, and placed on two adjacent
sides of the pallet or other equipment. Each tray of heavy letter mail must also be identified by a flag (similar to a
separator card) clearly marked ``HEAVY LETTER MAIL'' and placed in front of the contents of the tray. No marking will
be required on the pieces of heavy letter mail themselves other than as required by the class or rate claimed, or by the
postage payment method used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Participants in the heavy letter mail test will also be asked to provide documentation for any heavy letter mailing
exceeding 100,000 pieces. Requested information includes the mailer's name and contact person for test information,
the mailing's contents (size, weight, volume, level of presort, and proportion of heavy letter mail), and the mailing's
distribution (place(s) of mailing and destination ZIP Code ranges). This information, which should be provided
to the address below at least 3 weeks before mailing, will allow the Postal Service adequate time to conduct on-site
evaluation and data collection for test mail. Documentation of heavy letter mailings should be addressed to:

pieces before delivery (by completing Form 1509) to allow their examination for evaluation of both the cause of the
damage and possible remedies for that cause.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On December 31, 1985, June 29, 1988, and August 19, 1992, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources
(PADER) formally submitted amendments to 25 Pa Code Chapter 121_General Provisions and Chapter 129_Standards for
VOC as SIP revisions. These revisions were submitted by PADER to correct existing deficiencies in its VOC regulations
and to control emissions as part of the Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) Fix-up requirement of Section
182 of the CAA. Specifically, this document approves the addition of &sect;129.72_Manufacture of Sulfonates (Surface
Active Agents) and &sect;129.71_Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry Equipment (SOCMI) Leaks into
the PADER SIP submitted on December 31, 1985 and June 29, 1988, as well as amendments to the following section of 25 PA
Code &sect;121.4_Regional Organization of the Department; &sect;129.51 General_VOC Recordkeeping Requirements;
&sect;129.52_Surface Coating; &sect;129.62_General Standards for Bulk Gasoline Terminals, Bulk Gasoline Plants
and Small Gasoline Storage Tanks; &sect;129.66_Compliance Schedules and Final Compliance Dates; &sect;129.67_Graphic
Arts; and &sect;129.69_Pneumatic Rubber Tire Manufacturing; &sect;129.72_Manufacture of Sulfonates (Surface
Active Agents) and &sect;129.71_Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry (SOCMI) Equipment Leaks contained
in the August 19, 1992 submittal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The December 31, 1985 and June 29, 1988 submittals also included a request that EPA approve the addition of the Commonwealth's
wood cabinet and wood furniture finishing rule into the Pennsylvania's SIP. That regulation is the subject of a separate
rulemaking document. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On May 26, 1988, EPA issued a SIP call letter to Pennsylvania notifying the Commonwealth that its SIP was substantially
inadequate to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone. In a June 14, 1988 follow-up letter,
EPA notified PADER of deficiencies in its existing VOC regulations which needed to be corrected in order to make the
regulations consistent with EPA policy and guidance. A SIP call letter is a finding made by EPA that the SIP does not
provide for attainment by the required date, (section 110(a)(2)(H) of the Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(H);
42 U.S.C. 7410(A)(K)(5)). EPA's review of this material indicates that PADER has addressed the deficiencies pertaining
to the correction of State VOC regulations required by section 182(a)(2)(A) and section 184(b) of the Act, as amended
in 1990.

Section 129.51_General 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 129.51(d) was amended to add general recordkeeping requirements for regulated sources of VOCs subject to
the emission limitations and control requirements in Chapter 129. Section 129.51 requires the owner or operator
of a facility or source to keep records to demonstrate compliance with the applicable limitation or control requirement.
Those records are to provide sufficient data and calculations which clearly demonstrate that the emission limitations
or control requirements are met. The data or information required to determine compliance with the applicable limitation
are to be recorded and maintained in a timeframe consistent with the averaging period of the standard. The records
are to be retained at least two years and made available to PADER on request. A facility or source which claims exemption
from the emission limitations and control requirements is to maintain records adequate to demonstrate that the facilities
and sources are entitled to the exemption.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 129.52(a) was changed to expand the applicability of the surface coating requirements to statewide for facilities
with emissions greater than 2.7 tons/yr., 15 lbs/day, or 3 lbs/hr. before controls.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Subsection (c) specifies that a person may not allow a gasoline tank truck subject to &sect;129.59_Bulk Gasoline
Terminals, &sect;129.60_Bulk Gasoline Plants or &sect;129.61_Small Gasoline Storage Tank Control to be filled
or emptied statewide unless the gasoline tank truck meets the requirement below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The word ``annual'' was deleted from subsection (c)(1) to add ``12 months.'' The gasoline tank truck leak check requirement
was revised to clarify the annual gasoline tank truck leak check requirement to add that the owner or operator subject
to the requirements of &sect;129.62(c) may not allow a tank to be filled or emptied statewide unless the gasoline tank
truck has been tested by the owner or operator within the immediately preceding 12 months in accordance to the applicable
test method and procedure in &sect;139.14_Emissions of VOCs.

Section 129.66_Compliance Schedules and Final Compliance Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This regulation adds a one year compliance interval for existing sources newly subject to the requirements of &sect;129.52,
&sect;&sect;129.59&hyph;129.61, &sect;&sect;129.67&hyph;129.69 as a result of the revised applicability requirements,
and to the newly affected pneumatic rubber manufacturing facilities and surface coating processes subject to the
emission standards. Newly subject sources or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities are those existing sources which were not previously subject to the emission limitations because they
emitted less than the cutoff levels or operated at de minimis production levels prior to the date of publication of
the limitation in the Pennsylvania Bulletin, but are now subject to the standard because they meet or exceed the cutoff
levels; compliance shall be achieved by May 23, 1993. Section 129.68_Manufacture of Synthesized Pharmaceutical
Products was deleted from this section because the compliance schedule (August 3, 1992) for this source category
was the subject of a separate rulemaking.

Section 129.67_Graphic Arts Systems 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 129.67(e) establishes a requirement that the emissions of VOCs used in clean-up operations shall be summed
with emissions from surface coating and printing to determine the applicability of the graphic arts regulatory requirements.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 129.69_Manufacture of Pneumatic Rubber Tires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The VOC control requirements in Section 129.69(a) are revised to delete the 5,000 tire/day exemption level, add the
definitions of pneumatic rubber tire manufacture and passenger type tire, specify minimum control requirements
for tire manufacturing, and allow an affected tire manufacturer to petition for approval of an alternative RACT control
program. Such an alternative must be approved by PADER and EPA as a SIP revision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing is defined as the production of pneumatic rubber passenger-type on a mass production
basis, and passenger-type tires are agricultural, airplane, industrial, mobile home, light or medium duty truck
or passenger vehicle tires with bead diameters up to 20 inches (50.8 centimeters) and cross-sectional dimensions
up to 12.8 inches (32.5 centimeters). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, this section adds that the production of specialty tires for antique or other vehicles, when produced
on an irregular basis or with short production runs and when produced on equipment separate from normal production
lines for passenger-type tires, are exempt from the requirements of this section upon written approval from PADER.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (b)(1) clarifies the requirement that the owner or operator of an undertread cementing, tread-end cementing
or bead dipping operation subject to this section shall install and operate a capture system designed to achieve maximum
reasonable capture of at least 85% by weight of VOC emitted, from all undertread cementing, tread-end cementing and
bead dipping operations.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (d) deletes the 0.161 pound per tire emission limit, and adds the requirement that as an alternative to
meeting the specified control level, an affected facility may develop and implement an alternative RACT control
program if the program is approved by the PADER and EPA as a SIP revision.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 129.71(a) applies to surface active agent manufacturing facilities subject to &sect;129.72 (relating
to manufacturing of surface active agents) and to facilities with design capability to manufacture 1,000 tons per
year (tpy) or more of one or a combination of synthetic organic chemicals listed in 40 CFR 60.489 (relating to list of
chemicals provided by affected facilities), Methyl tert-butyl ether, polyethylene, polypropylene, or polystyrene.
The previous 4,000 tpy applicability level was deleted.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (c) requires the owner or operator of a newly affected facility to complete, develop and initiate a leak
detection program including liquid leaks for pumps, valves, compressors, vessels, and safety pressure relief valves
and a repair program for these components that cause a hydrocarbon detection instrument reading equal to or greater
than 10,000 ppm not later than May 23, 1993. The leak detection and repair program shall include the following: a leak
check during every quarter of all components, by methods referenced in &sect;139.14; a waterproof identification
tag is to be attached to the leaking component (that is causing the instrument to read greater than 10,000 ppm) with
the identification number and the date which the leak was detected in a visible area; the repair and retest of a leaking
component must be done within 15 days from the date of detection; and the identification tag must indicate if the component
cannot be repaired until a process shutdown that will not occur within 15 days from the date of detection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subsection (2)(iv) was revised to require a weekly visual check of all pumps in light liquid service for indications
of leaks.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The fugitive emission leak check requirements in &sect;139.14 (relating to emissions of VOCs) were separated from
subsection (2)(iv) and added as a new subsection, (2)(v). This new subsection specifies that safety relief valves
are subject to the requirements for rechecking within 24 hours. The requirements for the recordkeeping and reporting
of the leak detection and repair program were separated from subsection (2)(iv) and added as a new subsection, (2)(vi).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 129.72 requires a leak detection program (see &sect;129.71 synthetic organic chemical and polymer manufacturing
fugitive sources). Subsection (b) of this section was amended to clarify the emission control system efficiency
requirements for surface active agent manufacturing facilities with potential VOC emissions of greater than 100
tpy. Emission of VOCs in ambient air from solvent wash tanks, reaction vessels, separators, distillation processes,
solvent trippers and solvent storage tanks may not be caused or permitted by any person unless the emissions are exhausted
through an emission reduction system which is designed and operated to recover or destroy at least 90% by weight of
the VOC emissions exhausted to the emission reduction system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking because the Agency
views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document
in this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 publication, EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action
will be effective February 21, 1995, unless, within 30 days of publication, adverse or critical comments are received.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If EPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a document that
will withdraw the final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based
on this action serving as a proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties
interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised
that this action will be effective on February 21, 1995.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is approving the addition of and revision to Pennsylvania's SIP to control VOCs from &sect;129.52 - surface coating,
&sect;129.69 - pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing, &sect;129.67 - graphic arts and &sect;129.72 - synthetic organic
chemical manufacturing industry equipment leaks which were submitted to EPA on December 31, 1985, June 29, 1988 and
August 19, 1992. These revisions meet part of the RACT Fix-up requirement of the Act, as amended.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request
for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical,
economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.

EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities.
5 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, Part D of the Clean Air Act do not create any new requirements but simply
approve requirements that the Commonwealth is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does
not impose any new requirements, the Administrator certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small
entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAA, preparation of a
flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Clean
Air Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.

.) requires a ban on the importation of commercial fish or products from fish that have been caught with commercial
fishing technology which results in the incidental kill or serious injury of marine mammals in excess of U.S. standards.
In the case of yellowfin tuna harvested by purse seine in the ETP, the MMPA requires a ban unless the harvesting nation
has a program and performance that is comparable in its level of marine mammal protection to that of the United States.
The regulatory program of the harvesting nation must include, among other things, such prohibitions against encircling
certain schools of dolphin, conducting sundown sets, and other activities as are applicable to U.S. vessels under
the marine mammal program of the United States (16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(2)(B)(I)). MMPA regulations require that harvesting
nations implement marine mammal protection requirements within 180 days of the date that such requirements are placed
on U.S. vessels (50 CFR 216.24(e)(5)(v)(B)).

Earth Island Institute v. Brown

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, No. C 88&hyph;1380 TEH, enjoined NMFS, effective immediately, from permitting any incidental taking of any northeastern
offshore spotted dolphin in the ETP, and required that NMFS include this prohibition in the comparability requirements
for foreign nations. On February 1, 1994, NMFS notified U.S. vessels fishing under the general permit issued to the
American Tunaboat Association (ATA general permit) that all sets on the northeastern stock of offshore spotted dolphin
were prohibited due to the stock's recently determined status as depleted under the MMPA. On February 4, 1994, NMFS
further advised those vessels that the take of all offshore spotted dolphin was prohibited immediately under the
provisions of the January 27, 1994, order requiring NMFS to minimize the take of northeastern offshore spotted dolphin.
On February 8, NMFS, in order to ensure that the aggregate dolphin mortality quota mandated by the International Dolphin
Conservation Act was not exceeded, prohibited the taking of any additional dolphin, regardless of species or stock,
under the ATA general permit, thus closing the fishery.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On February 22, 1994, NMFS published a notice in the

 (59 FR 8417) of the January 27, 1994, court order, and of the February 1, 4, and 8, 1994, NMFS actions discussed above.
The prohibition on the take of any of the northeastern stock of offshore spotted dolphin has been incorporated as a
new element in the marine mammal program of the United States. On August 24, 1994, with a subsequent technical correction
on September 19, 1994, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California amended its order of January
27, 1994, and specified that its prohibition applied only in the area from 40

As of September 28, 1994, NMFS had not received documentary evidence from Colombia or from the Republic of Vanuatu
that either nation has incorporated into its marine mammal protection program a prohibition on encircling with a
purse seine net any school in which a northeastern offshore spotted dolphin is observed. Therefore, because the 180-day
period allowed for a foreign nation to adopt a comparable prohibition expired on July 26, 1994, in adherence to the
regulations and court orders cited above, NMFS on September 28, 1994, notified the U.S. Customs Service, and here
announces, an immediate ban on imports of yellowfin tuna harvested in the ETP by purse seine vessels of Columbia and
the Republic of Vanuatu.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The domestic and foreign groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the GOA are managed by NMFS according
to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific
Fishery Management Council (Council) under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act.
The FMP is implemented by regulations for the foreign fishery at 50 CFR part 611 and for the U.S. fisheries at 50 CFR parts
672, 676, and 677. General regulations that also pertain to the U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action provides certain specifications for the 1995 fishing year on a preliminary or interim basis, including:
(1) Specifications of total allowable catch (TAC) for each groundfish target species category in the GOA and apportionments
thereof among domestic annual processing (DAP), joint venture processing (JVP), total allowable level of foreign
fishing (TALFF), and reserves; (2) apportionments of reserves to DAP; (3) apportionments of the sablefish TAC to
vessels using hook-and-line and trawl gear; (4) apportionments of pollock TAC; (5) apportionments of Pacific cod
TAC; (6) ``other species'' TAC; (7) halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits; (8) seasonal allocations of the
halibut PSC limits, (9) interim groundfish harvest specifications, (10) the opening date of the directed fishery
for sablefish for hook-and-line gear, and (11) closures to directed fishing. A discussion of each of these measures
follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Proposed Establishment of TACs and Apportionments Thereof Among Domestic Annual Processing (DAP), Joint Venture
Processing (JVP), Total Allowable Level of Foreign Fishing (TALFF), and Reserves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii), NMFS, after consultation with the Council, publishes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 preliminary specifications of annual TACs and interim harvest limits. These preliminary specifications indicate
apportionments of TACs among DAP, JVP, reserves, and TALFF for each target species and the ``other species'' category.
The sum of the TACs for all species must fall within the combined optimum yield (OY) range, of 116,000&hyph;800,000
metric tons (mt), established for these species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Species TACs are apportioned initially among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserves under &sect;&sect;611.92(c)(1) and
672.20(a)(2). DAP amounts are intended for harvest by U.S. fishermen for delivery and sale to U.S. processors. JVP
amounts are intended for joint ventures in which U.S. fishermen deliver their catches to foreign processors at sea.
TALFF amounts are intended for harvest by foreign fishermen. Existing harvesting and processing capacity of the
U.S. industry is capable of utilizing the entire 1995 TAC specification for GOA groundfish. Therefore, the Council
recommended that DAP equal TAC for each species category, resulting in no proposed amounts of TALFF or JVP for the 1995
fishing year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reserves for the GOA are 20 percent of the TACs for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish target species categories, and
``other species.'' Given that the GOA groundfish TACs have been utilized fully by DAP since 1987, NMFS has reapportioned
all the reserves to DAP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council met from September 28 to October 5, 1994, to review scientific information concerning groundfish stocks.
The preliminary SAFE Report, dated September 1994, prepared and presented to the Council by the GOA Plan Team (Plan
Team), summarizes the best available scientific information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The September 1994 SAFE Report contains revised stock assessments for all species except sablefish and demersal
shelf rockfish (DSR). New assessments for these two species are discussed in the final SAFE Report issued in November.
New stock assessment models were used in the assessments for Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, and thornyhead rockfish.
Additional information, based on 1993 trawl surveys, was presented for pollock, slope rockfish, Pacific ocean perch
(POP), pelagic shelf rockfish, and the flatfish groups. Details of the assessments can be found in the September 1994
SAFE Report. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total ABC amount recommended by the SSC and accepted by the Council was a range from 481,090 &hyph; 533,690 mt. The
range accounted for the recommended ABC range in the Pacific cod stock. The total TAC amount recommended by the Advisory
Panel (AP) was 326,515 mt. The AP recommended a 1995 TAC equal to the 1995 ABCs, as recommended by the SSC, for pollock,
rex sole, sablefish, shortraker/rougheye, other rockfish, northern rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, DSR, and
thornyhead rockfish. The AP recommendation for a 1995 TAC for Pacific cod was equal to the upper end of the range (103,000
mt) recommended by the SSC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council considered information in the SAFE Report, recommendations from its SSC and its AP, as well as public testimony.
The Council then accepted the ABCs as recommended by the SSC and, with the exception of ``other rockfish,'' the TACs
as recommended by the AP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council chose a TAC range for ``other rockfish'' that ranged from the 1994 TAC amount of 2,235 mt to the 1995 ABC amount
of 6,930 mt. This range was recommended to recognize the need for conservative management of this group. However,
NMFS must manage the fisheries based on a single TAC amount, rather than on a range of numbers. NMFS has chosen to propose
a TAC of 6,930 mt, which is the number proposed by the AP and is the ABC that was recommended from the 1994 stock assessment.
Even though this number will be used to establish the 1995 interim TAC until the final specifications are implemented,
no practical difference exists in choosing any number within the Council's recommended TAC range. The hook-and-line
fisheries typically do not harvest other rockfish and the trawl fisheries for rockfish do not open until July 1, by
which time the final specifications will be published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS also revises the Council's recommendation for the 1995 flathead sole TAC. The Council approved the AP recommendation
of adopting the 1994 TAC amounts for flathead sole for the 1995 TAC amounts. In the GOA Eastern Regulatory Area, the
1994 TAC amount (3,000 mt) is higher than the Council's recommended 1995 ABC (2,740 mt). To maintain consistency with
the accepted policy of setting TACs lower than or equal to ABC amounts, NMFS is proposing to establish a 1995 TAC of 2,740
mt for the Eastern Regulatory Area. This number is equal to the 1995 ABC recommended by the Plan Team and the SSC and approved
by the Council. Adjustment of the flathead sole TAC in the Eastern Regulatory Area changes the total 1995 flathead
sole TAC to 9,740 mt. This also results in a revised ``other species'' TAC amount of 15,535 mt and a revised 1995 total
GOA TAC of 326,242 mt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1995 ABCs, TACs and interim TACs, as well as the ABC and TAC apportionments, are shown in Table 1.

2. Preliminary Apportionment of Reserves to DAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations implementing the FMP require 20 percent of each TAC for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish species, and the
``other species'' category be set aside in reserves for possible apportionment at a later date (&sect;672.20(a)(2)(ii)).
Consistent with &sect;672.20(a)(2)(iii), NMFS is preliminarily apportioning the 1995 reserves for each of the
four species categories to DAP, anticipating that domestic harvesters and processors have established markets
for these species and should be provided the opportunity to realize revenues from the harvest of the full DAP amounts
so specified. Specifications of DAP shown in Table 1 reflect apportioned reserves.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;672.24(c), sablefish TACs for each of the regulatory areas and districts are assigned to hook-and-line
and trawl gear. In the Central and Western Regulatory Areas, 80 percent of the TAC is allocated to hook-and-line gear
and 20 percent is allocated to trawl gear. In the Eastern Regulatory Area, 95 percent of the TAC is assigned to hook-and-line
gear and 5 percent is assigned to trawl gear. The trawl gear allocation in the Eastern Regulatory Area may only be used
as bycatch to support directed fisheries for other target species. Sablefish caught in the GOA with gear other than
hook-and-line or trawl must be treated as prohibited species and may not be retained. Table 2 shows the assignments
of the preliminary 1995 sablefish TACs between hook-and-line and trawl gears.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In the GOA, pollock is apportioned by area and season. These amounts are further apportioned between inshore and offshore
components. Regulations at &sect;672.20(a)(2)(iv) require that the TAC for pollock in the combined Western/Central
Regulatory Areas (W/C) be apportioned among statistical areas Shumagin (61), Chirikof (62), and Kodiak (63) in proportion
to known distribution of the pollock biomass. This measure was intended to provide spatial distribution of the pollock
harvest as a sea lion protection measure. Each statistical area apportionment is further divided equally into the
four calendar quarters. Within any fishing year, any unharvested amount of any quarterly allowance of pollock TAC
is added in equal proportions to the quarterly allowances of following quarters, resulting in a sum for each quarter
not to exceed 150 percent of the initial quarterly allowance. Similarly, harvests in excess of a quarterly allowance
of TAC are deducted in equal proportions from the remaining quarterly allowances of that fishing year. The Eastern
Regulatory Area proposed TAC of 3,360 mt is not allocated among smaller areas, or quarterly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations at &sect;672.20(a)(2)(v)(A) require that the DAP apportionment for pollock in all regulatory areas
and all quarterly allowances thereof be divided into inshore and offshore components. The inshore component is apportioned
100 percent of the pollock DAP in each regulatory area after subtraction of amounts that are determined by the Director,
Alaska Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) to be necessary to support the bycatch needs of the offshore component in
directed fisheries for other groundfish species. At this time, these bycatch amounts are unknown, and will be determined
during the fishing year. The preliminary distribution of pollock within the combined W/C GOA is shown in Table 3, except
that inshore and offshore component apportionments of pollock are not shown.

The FMP specifies that amounts for the ``other species'' category are calculated as 5 percent of the combined TACs
for target species. The GOA-wide ``other species'' TAC is calculated as 15,535 mt, which is 5 percent of the sum of combined
TACs for the target species.

7. Preliminary Halibut PSC Mortality Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under &sect;672.20(f), annual Pacific halibut PSC mortality limits are established for trawl and hook-and-line
gear and may be established for pot gear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its September 1994 meeting, the Council recommended that, for 1995, NMFS re-establish 1994 PSC limits of 2,000
mt and 750 mt for the trawl and hook-and-line gear fisheries, respectively, with 10 mt of the hook-and-line limit allocated
to the DSR fishery in the Southeast Outside District and the remainder to other hook-and-line gear fisheries. These
interim specifications exempt pot gear from halibut limits for 1994, as proposed by the Council. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1994, NMFS approved a rule that authorizes separate apportionments of the trawl halibut bycatch mortality limit
between trawl fisheries for deep-water and shallow-water species (59 FR 38132, July 27, 1994). These apportionments
are divided seasonally to avoid seasonally high halibut bycatch rates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the goals and objectives of the FMP to reduce halibut bycatches while providing an opportunity to
harvest the groundfish OY, NMFS preliminarily concurs in the Council's 1995 recommendations and assigns 2,000 mt
and 750 mt of halibut PSC mortality limits to trawl and hook-and-line gear, respectively, as interim limits. While
these limits would reduce the harvest quota for commercial halibut fishermen, NMFS has determined that they would
not result in unfair allocation to any particular user group. NMFS recognizes that some halibut bycatch will occur
in the groundfish fishery, but expansion of the Vessel Incentive Program, required modifications to gear, implementation
of the IFQ program, and changes in the season start date for some fisheries are intended to reduce adverse impacts on
halibut fishermen while promoting the opportunity to achieve the OY from the groundfish fishery.

8. Preliminary Seasonal Allocations of the Halibut PSC Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under &sect;672.20(f)(2)(iii), NMFS preliminarily allocates seasonal halibut PSC limits based on recommendations
from the Council. The Council recommended the same seasonal allocation of PSC limits for the 1995 fishing year as those
in effect during the 1994 fishing year. The publication of the final 1994 initial groundfish and PSC specifications
(59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) summarizes Council findings with respect to each of the FMP considerations set forth
above. At this time, the Council's findings are unchanged from those set forth for 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pacific halibut PSC limits, and apportionments thereof, are presented in Table 5. Regulations specify that any overages
or shortfalls in PSC limits will be accounted for within the 1995 season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council did not recommend changes in the seasonal apportionments for the hook-and-line gear fisheries from those
specified in 1994; however, NMFS notes that the opening date of the sablefish fishery is scheduled to change from May
18, in 1994, to March 1, in 1995, under the IFQ program. This change and the Council's proposed exemption of the sablefish
fishery from the 1995 PSC limit may prompt the Council to alter its recommendation for seasonal apportionments at
its December 1994 meeting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Pacific halibut PSC limit for hook-and-line gear is allocated to the demersal shelf rockfish (DSR) fishery and
fisheries other than DSR.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Current regulations at &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(A) require that one-fourth of the proposed TAC (not including the
reserves and the first quarterly allowance of pollock), one-fourth of the inshore and offshore allocations of Pacific
cod in each regulatory area, and one-fourth of the halibut PSC amounts, take effect on January 1 on an interim basis
and remain in effect until superseded by the final 1995 initial specifications published in the Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 or until harvested. Seasonal apportionments of TACs or PSC limits under provisions of other regulations may supersede
this interim specification. Table 1 shows amounts of proposed specifications of target species and the ``other species''
categories in effect on an interim basis beginning January 1, 1995.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;672.20(c)(2)(ii), if the Regional Director determines that the amount of a target species or ``other
species'' category apportioned to a fishery, or with respect to Pacific cod, to an allocation to the inshore or offshore
component, is likely to be reached, the Regional Director may establish a directed fishing allowance for that species
or species group. In establishing a directed fishing allowance, the Regional Director shall consider the amount
of that species group or allocation of Pacific cod to the inshore or offshore component that will be taken as incidental
catch in directed fishing for other species in the same regulatory area or district. If the Regional Director establishes
a directed fishing allowance, and that allowance is or will be reached before the end of the fishing year, NMFS will
prohibit directed fishing for that species or species group in the specified regulatory area or district. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Regional Director has determined that interim amounts of groundfish specified by this preliminary specification
(Table 1) for species or species groups identified in Table 7 will be necessary as incidental catch to support anticipated
groundfish fisheries prior to the time that final specifications of groundfish are in effect for the 1995 fishing
year. Therefore, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for those target species, gears, and components listed in
Table 7 to prevent exceeding the interim amounts of groundfish TACs specified. These closures will be in effect during
the period that the appropriate interim specifications of groundfish TACs are in effect. During these closures,
applicable directed fishing standards may be found at &sect;672.20(g). Additional closures and restrictions may
be found in existing regulations at 50 CFR part 672.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Student Loan Reform Act of 1993, enacted on August 10, 1993, established the Direct Loan Program under the Higher
Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 Subtitle A of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66). Under the Direct Loan Program,
loan capital is provided directly to student and parent borrowers by the Federal Government rather than through private
lenders. Borrowers under the Direct Loan Program are provided a range of repayment options, including an ICR plan.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The HEA directs the Secretary to consult with members of the higher education community and to publish a notice of standards,
criteria, and procedures for the program's first year in lieu of issuing regulations using the Department's usual
procedures. The Secretary's representatives have consulted with representatives of students, colleges, universities,
proprietary schools, and educational associations, as well as representatives of the financial aid community,
in developing this notice. In particular, the Secretary's representatives have had extensive consultations with
the other members of the Direct Student Loan Regulations Negotiated Rulemaking Advisory Committee established
to develop proposed regulations for the second and subsequent years of the program. See the Secretary's announcement
of his intention to establish this Committee at 58 FR 68619 (December 28, 1993). The Secretary, in consultation with
the above-discussed members of the higher education community, has determined that this notice is reasonable and
necessary to the successful implementation of the first year of the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice modifies the provisions of the ICR plan and the alternative repayment plan for the 1994&hyph;95 academic
year.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On July 1, 1994, the Secretary published a final regulation governing the Direct Loan Program for the 1994&hyph;95
academic year. That regulation prescribes the formula used to determine the repayment amounts under the ICR plan
for borrowers whose loans enter repayment during the 1994&hyph;95 academic year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 18, 1994, the same formula was published in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking relating to the 1995&hyph;96
and subsequent years of the Direct Loan Program. The Secretary received 98 comments on that NPRM, most of which include
discussion of the ICR plan. In response to those comments, the Secretary made several changes to the ICR plan for the
1995&hyph;96 and subsequent academic years. The changes provide borrowers with better repayment terms than are
currently available for the 1994&hyph;95 academic year. For example, the limit on the amount of interest that will
be capitalized (or added to principal) was reduced from 50 percent of the original principal to 10 percent of the original
principal, thereby reducing the cost of borrowing significantly for some borrowers whose monthly payments are lower
than the amount of interest accrued. The new ICR formula also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lowers the required monthly payment for many borrowers who have lower incomes.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice extends the revised ICR formula and its benefits, including the reduced level of capitalization, to borrowers
whose loans enter repayment in the 1994&hyph;95 academic year. This notice also reduces the level of capitalization
of interest on loans repaid under the alternative repayment plan for borrowers whose loans enter repayment in the
1994&hyph;95 academic year. Finally, this notice establishes a 30-year maximum repayment period for the alternative
repayment plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that it is desirable for all Direct Loan borrowers who choose the ICR plan to be subject to the
same formula during the first years of this new program. As of this date, no Direct Loan borrowers have entered repayment
under the ICR formula published on July 1, 1994, but some Direct Loan borrowers will enter income contingent repayment
before the 1994&hyph;95 academic year is over. This notice provides that the revised ICR plan will apply to those borrowers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Secretary believes that applying one formula to all borrowers allows the Secretary to publish materials that
clearly explain the repayment options to borrowers without having to discuss multiple formulas. Furthermore, having
a single formula during the initial years of this program simplifies the administration of the program for schools
and promotes a clear understanding of the repayment provisions.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has established the maximum repayment period allowable under the alternative repayment plan at 30
years. Further, under the alternative plan, interest that accrues and is not paid will be capitalized annually until
the outstanding principal is 10 percent greater than the original principal amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Section 685.209&blank;Income Contingent Repayment Plan
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary has significantly modified the income contingent repayment (ICR) plan provisions. The Secretary
is lowering the limit on interest capitalization that may occur when interest accrues, but is not paid, from 50 percent
greater than the original principal amount to 10 percent greater than the original principal amount. Also, monthly
payments will be limited to 20 percent of discretionary income (AGI minus the poverty level appropriate to the family
size). This change eliminates the need for the previous family size offset of $7 and provides a new cap on the amount
of income assessed. The Secretary is including years of repayment under the 10-year standard repayment plan and the
12-year extended repayment plan as years eligible for determining the 25-year period for loan forgiveness. The monthly
repayment amount below which no payment is required under the formula calculation is $15. Under the 12-year standard
amortization cap, the minimum payment is $15 (that is, a borrower must pay at least $15 each month). The 12-year standard
amortization cap calculation has been modified to provide for the recalculation of the cap following periods of negative
amortization because these periods result in an increase in the outstanding loan balance. The payback rate for married
borrowers paying jointly under ICR will be calculated on the outstanding debt at the time the borrowers are approved
for joint repayment. For borrowers repaying jointly, payments will be applied to interest on both accounts prior
to principal reduction in either. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 685.209 (ICR plan) contains provisions governing the two monthly payment calculations, namely the formula
amount and the capped amount, available for repayment of Direct Loans under the ICR plan. Borrowers may choose to repay
either the formula amount or the capped amount. (See Appendix A for detailed examples illustrating, for single borrowers
and for married borrowers who are repaying under the ICR plan, the calculations of the formula and capped monthly repayment
amounts.)

Formula Amount
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculation of the ICR formula monthly payment amount is described in paragraph (b) of this section. In general, the
borrower's annual repayment obligation is the borrower's AGI multiplied by a ``payback rate'' that is based on the
borrower's debt. The monthly payment is the annual repayment obligation divided by 12. The ``payback rate'' varies
from four to 15 percent, calculated as described in paragraph (b)(2). The payment amount cannot exceed 20 percent
of discretionary income (AGI minus the annual poverty level appropriate to the family size) divided by 12. If the calculated
monthly payment is less than $15, the borrower is not required to make a payment. When a borrower is not required to make
a payment, interest on the principal accrues and will be capitalized until the limitation on capitalization is reached.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Capped Amount
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculation of the capped monthly payment amount is described in paragraph (c), and equals the monthly amount the
borrower would repay over 12 years using standard amortization schedules. If the formula amount exceeds the capped
amount, the borrower may choose to pay the capped amount. If the borrower chooses to pay the capped amount, the borrower's
repayment period may be longer than if the borrower chooses to pay the higher formula amount.

Joint Repayment By Married Borrowers
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section includes provisions for joint income contingent repayment of Direct Loans by married borrowers. Negative
amortization is minimized by attributing joint repayments first to the interest due on each spouse's account and
then to principal. A step-by-step calculation of a combined repayment amount is included as Example 2 in Appendix
A.

Repayment Period
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Provisions governing the repayment period under ICR are contained in paragraph (d)(2). The maximum period is 25 years,
excluding periods of authorized deferment and forbearance under &sect;&sect;685.204 and 685.205, respectively,
and periods in which the borrower made payments under a repayment plan other than the 10-year standard or 12-year extended
plans. The Secretary believes the exclusion of repayment periods under all other extended and graduated plans is
needed to prevent potential borrower repayment abuses.

<!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a borrower repays more than one loan under ICR and the loans enter repayment at different times, a separate repayment
period for each loan begins when the loan enters repayment. This approach ensures that no loan will be repaid under
ICR for more than 25 years. If loans enter repayment at the same time, a single repayment period applies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To encourage borrowers to begin repaying their loans and to limit negative amortization at the beginning of the repayment
period, a borrower must make monthly payments of accrued interest until the Secretary calculates the borrower's
monthly payment on the basis of the borrower's income. A borrower who is unable to make monthly payments of accrued
interest or is unable to qualify for a deferment under &sect;685.204, may request forbearance under &sect;685.205.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Limit on Capitalization of Interest
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Secretary believes a limit on the amount of interest that is added to principal (the capitalization of interest)
is desirable to prevent an excessive increase in a borrower's debt burden when the borrower's income is insufficient
to cover accruing interest. Paragraph (d)(3) permits capitalization of unpaid interest until the outstanding principal
amount is 10 percent greater than the original principal amount, a decrease from the 50 percent proposed in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPRM. Thereafter, unpaid interest accrues but is not capitalized. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
Consent to Disclosure of Tax Return Information
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to repay a Direct Loan under ICR, a borrower must consent, on a form provided by the Secretary, to the disclosure
of certain tax return information by the Internal Revenue Service to agents of the Secretary for purposes of calculating
a monthly repayment amount and servicing and collecting a loan. The information subject to disclosure is taxpayer
identity information as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6103(b)(6) (including such information as name, address, and social
security number), tax filing status, and AGI. Paragraph (d)(5) describes the procedures for providing written consent
and requires that consent be provided for a period of five years. If a borrower selects ICR but fails to provide or renew
consent, or withdraws consent without selecting a different repayment plan, the Secretary designates the 10-year
standard repayment plan for the borrower.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
III. Waiver of Rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested
parties an opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, Pub. L. 103&hyph;66 permits the Secretary to
publish a notice in lieu of regulations for the first year of the Direct Loan Program and exempts the contents of the
notice from the rulemaking requirements of section 431 of the General Education Provisions Act (recently revised
and renumbered by Pub. L. 103&hyph;382 as section 437). In developing this notice, the Secretary's representatives
have consulted extensively with the other members of the Direct Student Loan Regulations Negotiated Rulemaking
Advisory Committee established to develop proposed regulations for the second and subsequent years of the program,
and has taken into consideration the public comments submitted in response to the Secretary's invitation in the August
18, 1994 Direct Loan NPRM. The timely implementation of the ICR plan for borrowers entering repayment in academic
year 1994&hyph;1995 does not permit the solicitation of further public comment. A public comment period would seriously
delay operation of the Direct Loan Program and would prevent borrowers entering repayment during the first year of
the program from receiving the same benefits as borrowers who enter repayment in the second year of the program. Therefore,
the Secretary finds that solicitation of public comments is impracticable and contrary to the public interest under
5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). For the same reasons, the Secretary has decided to waive the 30-day delayed effective date under
5 U.S.C. 553(d).

adequate to accommodate the borrower's exceptional circumstances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Secretary may require a borrower to provide evidence of the borrower's exceptional circumstances before
permitting the borrower to repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) If the Secretary agrees to permit a borrower to repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan, the Secretary
notifies the borrower in writing of the terms of the plan. After the borrower receives notification of the terms of
the plan, the borrower may accept the plan or choose another repayment plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) A borrower shall repay a loan under an alternative repayment plan within 30 years of the date the loan entered repayment,
not including periods of deferment and forbearance.

(5) If the amount of a borrower's monthly payment under an alternative repayment plan is less than the accrued interest
on the loan, the unpaid interest is capitalized until the outstanding principal amount is 10 percent greater than
the original principal amount. After the outstanding principal amount is 10 percent greater than the original principal
amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized. For purposes of this paragraph, the original principal
amount is the amount owed by the borrower when the borrower enters repayment.

. (1) Under the income contingent repayment plan described in &sect;685.208(f), a borrower may choose to repay under
the formula described in paragraph (b) of this section or may choose to have payments capped as described in paragraph
(c) of this section. The amount calculated under paragraph (b) of this section is called the ``formula amount,'' and
the amount calculated under paragraph (c) of this section is called the ``capped amount.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Borrowers may choose to repay either the formula amount or the capped amount when they enter repayment and may change
between the options one time each year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The Secretary may determine that special circumstances, such as a loss of employment by the borrower or the borrower's
spouse, warrant an adjustment to the borrower's repayment obligations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Married borrowers may repay their loans jointly if they meet the following requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The spouses have both chosen either the formula amount or the capped amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The spouses filed a joint Federal income tax return for the most recent year for which the Secretary has obtained
income information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The spouses submit a written request to the Secretary that includes their names and social security numbers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) Examples of the calculation of monthly repayment amounts and tables that shows monthly repayment amounts for
borrowers at various income and debt levels are included in appendix A to this part.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) If a borrower chooses to pay the formula amount under the income contingent repayment plan, the borrower generally
makes monthly payments that are calculated using a percentage of the borrower's Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) called
the ``payback rate.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) A borrower's monthly payment is equal to the borrower's AGI multiplied by the payback rate, divided by 12 months.
However, a borrower's monthly payment is never larger than 20 percent of the borrower's discretionary income as defined
in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, divided by 12 months. Additionally, if the monthly repayment amount is
less than $15, the borrower is not required to make a payment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For purposes of this section, discretionary income is defined as a borrower's AGI minus the amount of the ``HHS
Poverty Guideline for all States (except Alaska and Hawaii) and the District of Columbia'' as published by the United
States Department of Health and Human Services on an annual basis.

 If a borrower provides documentation acceptable to the Secretary that the borrower has more than one person in the
borrower's family, the Secretary applies the HHS Poverty Guideline for the borrower's family size.

Payback rate. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) A borrower's payback rate is based upon the borrower's Direct Loan debt when the borrower's first loan enters repayment
and does not change unless the borrower obtains another Direct Loan or the borrower and the borrower's spouse obtain
approval to repay their loans jointly under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. If the borrower obtains another Direct
Loan, a new payback rate for all of the borrower's Direct Loans is calculated on the basis of the combined amounts of
the loans when the last loan enters repayment. If the borrower and the borrower's spouse repay the loans jointly, the
provisions under paragraph (b)(3) of this section apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) If the total amount of a borrower's Direct Loans is less than or equal to $1,000, the payback rate is four percent.
If the total amount of a borrower's Direct Loans is greater than $1,000, the payback rate is four percent plus an additional
percent that begins at zero and increases at a rate of 0.2 percent for each additional $1,000 borrowed up to a maximum
payback rate of 15 percent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) More specifically, if the total amount of a borrower's Direct Loans is greater than $1,000, the payback rate
is the lesser of 0.15 or the following: 0.04 + (debt ^ 1,000) (0.000002).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. (i) The combined monthly payment amount for married borrowers who repay their loans jointly under paragraph (a)(4)
of this section and who repay the formula amount is the total of the individual monthly payment amounts for each borrower
calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The payback rate for each borrower is calculated separately on the basis of the amount of the outstanding debt
on the borrower's Direct Loans at the time the borrower enters into joint repayment with the borrower's spouse. For
purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary assumes that the AGI for each borrower is proportionate to the relative
size of the borrower's individual debt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) For purposes of determining whether a borrower's payment amount is larger than 20 percent of the borrower's
discretionary income under paragraph (b)(1)(ii), a portion of the appropriate HHS Poverty Guideline for the borrowers'
family size 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is applied to each borrower in proportion to the relative size of the individual borrower's debts.

General. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If a borrower's monthly payments calculated under the formula amount as determined in paragraph (b) of this section
are greater than the capped amount calculated under paragraph (c)(2), the borrower may choose to repay the capped
amount. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Calculation of the capped amount. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The capped amount is the amount that a borrower would repay monthly over 12 years using standard amortization or
$15, whichever is greater. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The amount of the cap is recalculated on an annual basis to include changes in the variable rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) After periods in which a borrower makes payments that are less than interest accrued on the loan, the amount of
the cap is recalculated. If the new cap is larger than the existing cap, the new cap is applied. If the new cap is smaller
than or equal to the existing cap, the existing cap is applied. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Exception to the calculation of the capped amount for certain married borrowers. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The capped amount for married borrowers who repay jointly under paragraph (a)(4) of this section is the same amount
as calculated under paragraph (c)(2) of this section except that the amount is based on the combined Direct Loan debt
of the borrowers.

If a borrower's AGI is not available or if, in the Secretary's opinion, the borrower's reported AGI does not reasonably
reflect the borrower's current income, the Secretary may use other documentation of income provided by the borrower
to calculate the borrower's monthly repayment amount.

Repayment period. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) The maximum repayment period under the income contingent repayment plan is 25 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The repayment period includes periods in which the borrower makes payments under the standard repayment plan
and under extended repayment plans in which payments are based on a repayment period that is up to 12 years. The repayment
period does not include periods in which the borrower makes payments under the graduated and alternative repayment
plans or periods of authorized deferment or forbearance. The repayment period also does not include periods in which
the borrower makes payments under an extended repayment plan in which payments are based on a repayment period that
is longer than 12 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) If a borrower repays more than one loan under the income contingent repayment plan, a separate repayment period
for each loan begins when that loan enters repayment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) If a borrower has not repaid a loan in full at the end of the 25-year repayment period under the income contingent
repayment plan, the Secretary cancels the unpaid portion of the loan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) At the beginning of the repayment period under the income contingent repayment plan, a borrower shall make monthly
payments of the amount of interest that accrues on the borrower's Direct Loans until the Secretary calculates the
borrower's monthly repayment amount on the basis of the borrower's income. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Limitation on capitalization of interest. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
If the amount of a borrower's monthly payment is less than the accrued interest, the unpaid interest is capitalized
until the outstanding principal amount is ten percent greater than the original principal amount. After the outstanding
principal amount is ten percent greater than the original amount, interest continues to accrue but is not capitalized.
For purposes of this paragraph, the original amount is the amount owed by the borrower when the borrower enters repayment.

Notification of terms and conditions. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When a borrower elects or is required by the Secretary to repay a loan under the income contingent repayment plan, the
Secretary notifies the borrower of the terms and conditions of the plan, including_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) That the Internal Revenue Service will disclose certain tax return information to the Secretary or the Secretary's
agents; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) That if the borrower believes that special circumstances warrant an adjustment to the borrower's repayment
obligations, as described in &sect;685.209(a)(3), the borrower may contact the Secretary and obtain the Secretary's
determination as to whether an adjustment is appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Consent to disclosure of tax return information. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(i) A borrower shall provide written consent to the disclosure of certain tax return information by the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) to agents of the Secretary for purposes of calculating a monthly repayment amount and servicing and
collecting a loan under the income contingent repayment plan. The borrower shall provide consent by signing a consent
form, developed consistent with 26 CFR 301.6103(c)-1 and provided to the borrower by the Secretary, and shall return
the signed form to the Secretary. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The borrower shall consent to disclosure of the borrower's taxpayer identity information as defined in 26 U.S.C.
6103(b)(6), tax filing status, and AGI. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The borrower shall provide consent for a period of five years from the date the borrower signs the consent form.
The Secretary provides the borrower a new consent form before that period expires. The IRS does not disclose tax return
information after the IRS has processed a borrower's withdrawal of consent. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iv) The Secretary designates the standard repayment plan for a borrower who selects the income contingent repayment
plan but_
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Fails to provide the required written consent; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) Fails to renew written consent upon the expiration of the five-year period for consent; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) Withdraws consent and does not select another repayment plan. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(v) If a borrower defaults and the Secretary designates the income contingent repayment plan for the borrower but
the borrower fails to provide the required written consent, the Secretary mails a notice to the borrower establishing
a repayment schedule for the borrower.

Step 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the payback rate. Because the borrower's debt is greater than $1,000, the payback rate is calculated on
the basis of the formula in &sect;685.209(b)(2)(iii), as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->
<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Subtract $1,000 from the total amount of the borrower's Direct Loans: ($12,500^$1,000=$11,500).

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the calculated payback rate (0.063) to the maximum payback rate (0.15). Because the calculated rate is less
than the maximum rate, the borrower's payback rate is 0.063.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the annual repayment amount by multiplying the borrower's AGI by the payback rate: ($25,000&times;0.063=$1,575).

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the monthly repayment amount by dividing the annual repayment amount by 12 months: ($1,575
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
12=$131.25). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 5: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the borrower's discretionary income (AGI minus HHS Poverty Guideline for a family of one): ($25,000^$7,360=$17,640).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 6: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Multiply the borrower's discretionary income ($17,640) by 20 percent: ($17,640&times;.2=3,528).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 7: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Divide the amount calculated in Step 6 by 12 months: ($3,528
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
12=$294). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 8: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the amount calculated in Step 4 ($131.25) with the amount calculated in Step 7 ($294). The lower amount is the
formula amount. The formula amount is $131.25. The borrower's monthly payment under the formula amount would be $131.25.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG QTAG 01 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 9: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the monthly formula amount ($131.25) to the $15 floor repayment amount. Because the formula amount is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
greater than the $15 floor, the borrower's monthly formula amount is $131.25. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 10: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the formula amount calculated in Step 9 ($131.25) to the capped amount, which is the monthly amount the borrower
would repay under a 12-year standard amortization schedule. If the interest rate is seven percent, the 12-year standard
amortization amount is approximately $10.28 for every $1,000 of debt. In this example, since the borrower has $12,500
in debt, the capped amount is approximately $128.50 ($10.28&times;12.5). Because the formula amount ($131.25)
exceeds the capped amount ($128.50), the capped amount is the minimum monthly repayment. The borrower has the option
of paying the formula amount (or any higher amount).

Example 2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Married borrowers both repaying under the ICR plan with a combined Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) of $30,000. The husband
has $5,000 of Direct Loans. The wife has $15,000 of Direct Loans. The couple has two children. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 1: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the husband's payback rate. Because his debt is greater than $1,000, the payback rate is calculated on the
basis of the formula in &sect;685.209(b)(2)(iii) as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Subtract $1,000 from the amount of the husband's loans: ($5,000^$1,000=$4,000). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Multiply the result by 0.000002: ($4,000&times;0.000002=0.008). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add the result to 0.04: (0.04+0.008=0.048). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The result is the husband's payback rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 2: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the husband's calculated payback rate (0.048) to the maximum payback rate (0.15). Because the calculated
rate is less than the maximum rate, the husband's payback rate is 0.048. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 3: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the husband's assumed AGI by multiplying the couple's total AGI ($30,000) by the amount of the husband's
loans ($5,000), divided by the total amount of the couple's debt ($20,000): ($30,000&times;$5,000
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
$20,000=$7,500). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 4: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the husband's annual repayment amount by multiplying the husband's assumed AGI ($7,500) by his payback
rate (0.048): ($7,500&times;0.048=$360). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 5: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the husband's monthly repayment amount by dividing his annual repayment amount by 12 months: ($360
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
12=$30). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 6: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the couple's discretionary income (AGI minus HHS Poverty Guideline for a family of four): ($30,000^14,800=$15,200).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 7: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the husband's portion of the couple's discretionary income by multiplying the couple's discretionary
income ($15,200) by the amount of the husband's loans ($5,000) divided by the total amount of the couple's debt ($20,000):
($15,200&times;$5,000
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
$20,000=$3,800). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 8: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Multiply the husband's discretionary income by 20 percent: ($3,800^.2=$760). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 9: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Divide the amount calculated in Step 8 by 12 months: ($760

Step 10: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the monthly amount calculated in Step 5 ($30) with the monthly amount calculated in Step 9 ($63.33). The lower
amount is the formula amount. The formula amount is $30. If the borrowers choose to repay the formula amount, the husband's
payment would be $30.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 11: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the wife's payback rate. Because her debt is greater than $1,000, the payback rate is calculated on the basis
of the formula in &sect;685.209(b)(2)(iii) as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Subtract $1,000 from the amount of the wife's loans: ($15,000^$1,000=$14,000). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Multiply the result by 0.000002: ($14,000&times;0.000002=0.028). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Add the result to 0.04: (0.04+0.028=0.068). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The result is the wife's payback rate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 12: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the wife's calculated payback rate (0.068) to the maximum payback rate (0.15). Because the calculated rate
is less than the maximum rate, the wife's payback rate is 0.068. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 13: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the wife's assumed AGI by multiplying the couple's total AGI ($30,000) by the amount of the wife's loans
($15,000), divided by the total amount of the couple's debt ($20,000): ($30,000&times;$15,000
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
$20,000=$22,500). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 14: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the wife's annual repayment amount by multiplying the wife's assumed AGI ($22,500) by her payback rate
(0.068): ($22,500&times;0.068=$1,530). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 15: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the wife's monthly repayment amount by dividing the annual repayment amount calculated in Step 14 ($1,530)
by 12 months: ($1,530
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
12=$127.50). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 16: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the wife's portion of the couple's discretionary income by subtracting the husband's portion of the couple's
discretionary income calculated in Step 7 ($3,800) from the couple's total discretionary income calculated in Step
6 ($15,200): ($15,200^$3,800=$11,400). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 17: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Multiply the wife's discretionary income ($11,400) by 20 percent: ($11,400&times;.2=$2,280). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 18: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Divide the amount calculated in Step 17 by 12 months: ($2,280
<!-- PJG 0001 unknown -->
12=$190). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 19: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the monthly amount calculated in Step 15 ($127.50) with the monthly amount calculated in Step 18 ($190). The
lower amount is the formula amount. The formula amount is $127.50. If the borrowers choose to repay the formula amount,
the wife's payment would be $127.50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 20: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Calculate the couple's combined monthly formula amount by adding the husband's monthly formula amount calculated
in Step 10 ($30) and the wife's monthly formula amount calculated in Step 19 ($127.50): ($30+$127.50=$157.50). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 21: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the couple's combined monthly formula amount ($157.50) to the $15 floor repayment amount. Because the combined
formula amount is greater than the $15 floor, the couple's combined monthly formula amount is $157.50. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Step 22: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Compare the formula amount calculated in Step 21 ($157.50) to the capped amount, which is the amount the couple would
repay under a 12-year standard amortization schedule. If the interest rate is seven percent, the capped amount is
approximately $10.28 for every $1,000 of debt. In this example, since the couple has $20,000 in debt, the capped amount
is approximately $205.60 ($10.28&times;20). Because the formula amount ($157.50) does not exceed the capped amount
($205.60), the couple's combined monthly repayment amount is the formula amount of $157.50.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is rescinding its regulations on Designation and Transfer of D.C. Women Offenders
because it is no longer the routine policy of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections to place such inmates
in the federal system. By joint agreement with the Bureau, the Department of Corrections is responsible for notifying
D.C. women offenders being boarded in Bureau facilities of any applicable Department of Correction provisions previously
contained in these regulations. Therefore, separate notification by Bureau regulations is no longer necessary.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Bureau of Prisons is rescinding its regulations on Designation and Transfer of D.C. Women Offenders (28 CFR 527,
subpart F). A final rule on this subject was published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 October 21, 1983 (48 FR 48969). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with E.O. 12866, the Bureau of Prisons is reviewing its regulations for the purpose of ensuring that
it promulgates only such regulations as are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary
by compelling public need. The Bureau has determined that provisions for the designation and transfer of D.C. women
offenders are adequately covered through joint agreement with the District of Columbia Department of Corrections.
The text of the joint agreement has been incorporated in its entirety into the Bureau's internal instructions to staff,
and the Bureau believes that there is no need to restate these provisions in regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In 1972, a civil suit (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Garnes v. Taylor
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) was filed against the District of Columbia Department of Corrections seeking to have the court declare unconstitutional
the practice of transferring female D.C. Code violators to federal facilities far from the District of Columbia.
This suit was settled in 1975 by an agreement which established procedures for designating and transferring female
D.C. Code violators to and from federal institutions. This agreement, known as the ``Garnes Decree'', became effective
December 10, 1976. The Bureau of Prisons, recognizing that the District of Columbia Department of Corrections had
no facilities for housing long-term female offenders, agreed to designate federal institutions for women with sentences
of more than one year who are not within nine months of a parole eligibility, sentence expiration, or mandatory release
date. The Bureau further agreed to refer to the District of Columbia, for further consideration, a District of Columbia
woman confined within a Bureau institution provided that the inmate desires the referral and is within nine months
of a parole eligibility, sentence expiration, or mandatory release date. Regulations on this subject were issued
by the Bureau in 1983 as part of the general publication of Bureau rules relating to the control, custody, care, treatment,
and instruction of inmates. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1983, the number of female offenders transferred from the District of Columbia Department of Corrections has
declined to the point where only five cases remain in Bureau custody. Pursuant to a joint agreement with the Bureau,
the Department of Corrections is responsible for notifying these inmates of the pertinent designation and transfer
procedures. This is similar to procedures applicable to State inmates boarded in Bureau facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because this rescission imposes no new restrictions on inmates, the Bureau finds good cause for exempting the provisions
of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for
public comment, and delay in effective date. Members of the public may submit comments concerning this rule by writing
to the previously cited address. These comments will be considered but will receive no response in the

It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

 This document contains proposed regulations under sections 6051 and 6071 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 concerning
the time for furnishing wage statements to both employees and the Social Security Administration upon the termination
of an employer's operations. These proposed regulations will affect employers and their employees in the year the
employer ceases to pay wages. These regulations will improve the wage reconciliation process between the Social
Security Administration and the IRS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This document contains amendments to the Employment Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 31) under sections 6051 and 6071
of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The proposed regulations are to be issued under the authority of sections 6051,
6071 and 7805.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The proposed regulations improve the wage reconciliation process between the Social Security Administration (SSA)
and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by generally requiring an employer that is required to file a final Form 941,
Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, to file Forms W&hyph;2, Wage and Tax Statement, and W&hyph;3, Transmittal
of Wage and Tax Statements, with SSA and to furnish Form W&hyph;2 to the employees at the same time the employer is required
to file the final Form 941. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Prior to 1978, employers had submitted quarterly tax returns to the IRS listing both the aggregate wages and taxes
for all employees (Form 941) and each employee's name and Social Security number, showing the amount of wages paid
to the employee for that quarter (Schedule A of Form 941 or Form 941A). The IRS forwarded Form 941A to SSA, which used
it to post earnings to individual Social Security records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to minimize the burden on employers, Congress changed the requirement for submission of detailed wage statements
from a quarterly to an annual basis, effective in 1978. As a result, under the current system, an employer submits quarterly
tax returns (Forms 941) to the IRS listing the aggregate wages and taxes of all of its employees. Annual information
returns are submitted to SSA listing the wages of each individual employee (Forms W&hyph;2, accompanied by Forms

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
W&hyph;3 listing aggregate annual wages of all employees). A reconciliation problem arises when the aggregate wages
on the annual reports to the SSA do not match the aggregate wages on the four quarterly reports submitted to the IRS.
Where the wages reported to the IRS exceed the wages reported to SSA, this indicates a possible underreporting of social
security wages to SSA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One source of these discrepancies is the termination by employers of their business operations. In some instances,
employers that have gone out of business well before the due date for the annual filing of Form W&hyph;2 have failed
to file Forms W&hyph;2 with SSA as required. These failures have occurred even though the employer might have filed
one or more quarterly Forms 941 with the IRS during the year. In these cases, the failure to receive the Forms W&hyph;2
means SSA is unable to credit wages to the social security accounts of affected employees. This problem can be eliminated
by requiring employers that terminate business operations to file Forms W&hyph;2 and W&hyph;3 at the time they are
required to file the final Form 941. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generally, under &sect;31.6071(a)&hyph;1(a)(1) of the existing regulations, the Form 941 is due on or before the
last day of the first calendar month following the period (generally a calendar quarter) for which it is made. Thus,
the Form 941 is generally due on or before April 30, July 31, October 31, and January 31. There is a ten-day extension
if the employer timely deposited the taxes due for the quarter. Section 31.6011(a)&hyph;6(a)(1) of the existing
regulations requires an employer that ceases to pay wages in a quarter to mark and file the Form 941 for that quarter
as a final return. The proposed regulations require an employer that is required to file a final Form 941 to provide
Forms W&hyph;2 to the employees and Forms W&hyph;2 and 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
W&hyph;3 to SSA at the same time that the employer is required to file the final Form 941. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Different time frames apply to monthly Form 941 filers. Under &sect;31.6071(a)&hyph;1(a)(2) of the existing regulations,
if the district director notifies an employer that it is required to make monthly returns on Form 941 in lieu of quarterly
returns, the Form 941 is due on or before the fifteenth day of the calendar month following the period (generally a calendar
month) for which it is made. For employers that are required to file Form 941 monthly, requiring the filing of the Forms
W&hyph;2 at the same time as the final Form 941 might be unduly burdensome. Thus, the proposed regulations would not
require a monthly filer to provide Forms W&hyph;2 to the employees until the end of the calendar month in which the final
Form 941 is due, rather than by the fifteenth day of that month. The proposed regulations leave in place the provisions
of &sect;31.6071(a)&hyph;1(a)(3) of the existing regulations requiring a monthly filer that files a final Form
941 to furnish Forms W&hyph;2 and W&hyph;3 to SSA on or before the last day of the second calendar month following the
period for which the final Form 941 is due.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Under &sect;31.6051&hyph;1(d)(1) of the existing regulations, applicable to both quarterly and monthly Form 941
filers, if an individual's employment is terminated before the end of a calendar year, the employer may furnish Form
W&hyph;2 to the employee at any time after termination but no later than January 31 of the next year. If the terminated
employee requests a Form W&hyph;2, and if there is no reasonable expectation on the part of either the employer or the
employee of further employment during the calendar year, the employer must furnish Form W&hyph;2 to the employee
by the later of 30 days after the employee made the request or 30 days after the last payment of wages. The proposed regulation
has no effect on the rights of terminated employees to require the employer to furnish Form W&hyph;2 within this time
frame. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In Revenue Procedure 84&hyph;77, 1984&hyph;2 C.B. 753, the IRS provided procedures for preparing and filing certain
forms, including Form 941, Form W&hyph;2 and Form W&hyph;3, when a successor employer acquires substantially all
of the property (1) used in a trade or business of a predecessor employer, or (2) used in a separate unit of a trade or business
of a predecessor, and in connection with, or immediately after the acquisition (but during the same calendar year)
the successor employs individuals who were employed in the trade or business of the predecessor immediately prior
to the acquisition. This proposed regulation would have the effect of modifying the time frame for the standard procedure
in section 4.01 of the Revenue Procedure. Except for this change, the proposed regulation would not affect the continuing
validity of the Revenue Procedure. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed regulation applies to employers who file Form 941 on a monthly or quarterly basis, including railroad
employers. It does not apply to employers with respect to their agricultural employees (in those cases, employers
file on an annual basis on Form 943). Nor does it apply to employers with respect to their domestic employees (in those
cases, employers file on an annual basis beginning in 1995).

Special Analyses

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
It has been determined that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in
EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It also has been determined that section 553(b) of the
Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply
to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy
of the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on small business.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On August 15, 1994, the Postal Service filed a petition for institution of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking to re-enact Commission rules of practice and procedure on Postal Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests for changes in Express Mail rates in response to market conditions. These rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were the outcome of Docket No. RM88&hyph;2, Express Mail Rulemaking. That rulemaking, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
like this one, was instituted at the Service's request. The rules that were finally issued 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differed from those initially proposed by the Service. They are codified at 39 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3001.57&hyph;3001.57c. They took effect August 16, 1989. At that time, they were identified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as experimental rules and issued subject to a five-year sunset provision. That period has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expired. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As the Service notes in its recent petition, the original impetus for adoption of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these rules was a period of intense price competition in the expedited (overnight) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
delivery market. Postal Service Petition at 2. Prior to their adoption, rates for Express 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mail service could be set only by filing a formal request under rule 54. Rule 54 requires 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detailed information on costs, revenues, elasticities of demand and entails numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
procedural stages. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
39 CFR 3001.54. Fulfillment of these requirements generally 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
means that decisions on rate change requests require the full ten months allowed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statute. This effectively forecloses prompt responses to frequent price changes. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See generally 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
54 FR 33681 (August 16, 1989). As rapid price changes were the hallmark of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expedited delivery competition in the early-to-mid 1980s, it was believed that a flexible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ratemaking mechanism would allow the Postal Service to respond more effectively to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
market conditions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In support of its petition for re-enactment, the Postal Service acknowledges that it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
has never invoked the market response rules. However, it asserts several reasons for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
their retention. One is that the overnight delivery market remains competitive, primarily 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on price. Another is Express Mail's emergence as a low-cost alternative for household 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
users and small- and medium-volume businesses not eligible for discounts from other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carriers' published rates. A third is preservation of Express Mail's contribution to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
institutional costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission's initial review of the Service's petition leads it to agree that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Express Mail market response rules should be retained. Interested parties are invited to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on the appropriateness of this action. The Commission directs W. Gail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Willette, Acting Director of the Office of the Consumer Advocate, to participate to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extent necessary to fulfill her responsibilities under 39 CFR 3002.7 and part 3002, Appendix A.

Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the PRC hereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
certifies that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not expected to have a significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
flexibility analysis is not required.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) This section and &sect;&sect;3001.57a through 3001.57c only apply in cases in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Postal Service requests an expedited recommended decision pursuant to section 3622 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Postal Reorganization Act on changes in rates and fees for Express Mail service, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where the proposed changes are intended to respond to a change in the market for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expedited delivery services for the purpose of minimizing the loss of Express Mail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribution to institutional costs recommended in the most recent omnibus rate case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These rules set forth the requirements for filing data in support of such rate proposals 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and for providing notice of such requests, and establish an expedited procedural schedule 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for evaluating Market Response Rate Requests. These rules may not be used when the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postal Service is requesting changes in Express Mail rates as part of an omnibus rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case. Further explanation concerning these rules can be found at 54 FR 11394&hyph;413 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(March 20, 1989), 54 FR 251342&hyph;42 (June 13, 1989) and PRC Order No. 836.

(b) This section and &sect;&sect;3001.57a through 3001.57c are initially to be effective for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited period of five years from the date of their adoption by the Commission. During 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that period the Commission will continue to analyze the need for these rules to enable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Postal Service to respond to changes in the market for expedited delivery services, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the impact of these procedures on Postal Service proposals. These rules will cease 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be effective at the end of this period unless they have been reissued by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Commission following a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published in the

(a) Each formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3001.57c shall be accompanied by such information and data as are necessary to inform 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Commission and the parties of the nature and expected impact of the change in rates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed. Except for good cause shown, the information specified in paragraphs (c) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through (i) of this section shall also be provided with each request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this section, the information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
required by &sect;3001.54 (b) through (r) must be filed only for those subclasses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and services for which the Postal Service requests a change in rates or fees. Test period 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume, cost, and revenue estimates presented in satisfaction of rule 57a shall be for four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
postal quarters beginning after the filing date of the request. The cost roll-forward may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be developed by extending the cost forecasting model used in the last omnibus rate case 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(utilizing available actual data). Volume and revenue estimates required by these rules 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
shall utilize, to the extent practicable, the factors identified in rule 54 (j)(6), and must be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fully explained, with all available supporting documentation supplied, but they need not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be econometrically derived. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Every formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3001.57c shall contain an explanation of why the change proposed by the Postal Service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is a reasonable response to the change in the market for expedited delivery services to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which it is intended to respond. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Every formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3001.57c shall be accompanied by the then effective Domestic Mail Classification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Schedule sections which would have to be altered in order to implement the changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed by the Postal Service, and, arranged in a legislative format, the text of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
replacement Domestic Mail Classification Schedule sections the Postal Service proposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) In addition to the required test period cost estimates, every formal request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c shall be accompanied by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a statement of the attributable costs by segment and component for Express Mail service 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determined in accordance with the attributable cost methodology adopted by the Commission in the most recent omnibus
rate case, for the base year used in that case, and for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
each fiscal year thereafter for which cost data is available. If the Postal Service believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that an adjustment to that methodology is warranted it may also provide costs using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative methodologies as long as a full rationale for the proposed changes is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Each formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3001.57c shall include a description of all operational changes, occurring since the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recent omnibus rate case, having an important impact on the attributable cost of Express 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mail. Postal Service shall include an analysis and estimate of the cost impact of each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such operational change. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Every formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3001.57c shall be accompanied by a statement of the actual Express Mail revenues of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Postal Service from the then effective Express Mail rates and fees for the most recent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four quarters for which information is available. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Each formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3001.57c shall be accompanied by a complete description of the change in the market for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expedited delivery services to which the Postal Service proposal is in response, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statement of when that change took place, the Postal Service's analysis of the anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impact of that change on the market, and a description of characteristics and needs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
customers and market segments affected by this change which the proposed Express Mail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rates are designed to satisfy. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Each formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3001.57c shall include estimates, on a quarterly basis, of test period volumes, revenues, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and attributable costs determined in accordance with the attributable cost methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adopted by the Commission in the most recent omnibus rate case for each Express Mail 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
service for which rate changes are proposed assuming: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Rates remain at their existing levels, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) Rates are changed after 90 days to the levels suggested in the request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(j)(1) Each formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through 3001.57c shall be accompanied by the following information, for each quarter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following the base year in the most recent omnibus rate case: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) Estimated volume by rate cell, for each Express Mail service; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) Total postage pounds of Express Mail rated at: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(A) Up to 1/2 pound, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(B) 1/2 pound up to 2 pounds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(C) 2 pounds up to 5 pounds; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) Total pounds of Express Mail and of each other subclass of mail carried on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hub contracts. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) In each instance when rates change based on a proceeding under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c the Postal Service shall provide, one year 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
after the conclusion of the test period, the data described in &sect;3001.57a(j)(1)(i&hyph;iii), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for each of the four quarters of the test period. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(k) Each formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3001.57c shall include analyses to demonstrate: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) That the proposed rates are consistent with the factors listed in 39 U.S.C. 3622 (b), 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) That the proposed rate changes are in the public interest and in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the policies and applicable criteria of the Act, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) That the proposed rates will preserve, or minimize erosion of, the Express 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Mail contribution to institutional costs recommended in the most recent omnibus rate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(l) Each formal request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3001.57c shall be accompanied by a certificate that service of the filing in accordance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with &sect;3001.57b (c) has been made.

&sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c rates lower than: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) The average per piece attributable cost for Express Mail service determined in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the most recent omnibus rate case, or

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The average per piece attributable cost for Express Mail service as determined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by the Postal Service in accordance with &sect;3001.57a (e) for the most recent fiscal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
year for which information is available, whichever is higher. Neither shall the Postal

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(c) (1) Persons who are interested in participating in Express Mail Market 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Response Rate Request cases may register at any time with the Secretary of the Postal Rate Commission, who shall maintain
a publicly available list of the names and business addresses of all such Express Mail Market Response Registrants.
Persons whose names appear on this list will automatically become parties to each Express Mail Market Response rate
proceeding. Other interested persons may intervene pursuant to &sect;3001.20 within 28 days of the filing of a formal
request made under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c. Parties may withdraw from the register
or a case by filing a notice with the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) When the Postal Service files a request under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c it shall
on that same day effect service by hand delivery of the complete filing to each Express Mail Market Response Registrant
who maintains an address for service within the Washington metropolitan area and serve the complete filing by Express
Mail service on all other Registrants. Each Registrant is responsible for insuring that his or her address remains
current. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) When the Postal Service files a request under the provisions of &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c, it shall
on that same day send by Express Mail service to all participants in the most recent omnibus rate case a notice which
briefly describes its proposal. Such notice shall indicate on its first page that it is a notice of an Express Mail Market
Response Rate Request to be considered under &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c, and identify the last day for
filing a notice of intervention with the Commission. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) In the absence of a compelling showing of good cause, the Postal Service and parties shall calculate Express Mail
costs in accordance with the methodologies used by the Commission in the most recent omnibus rate case. In the analysis
of customers' reactions to the change in the market for expedited delivery services which prompts the request, the
Postal Service and parties may estimate the demand for segments of the expedited delivery market and for types of customers
which were not separately considered when estimating volumes in the most recent omnibus rate case. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) (1) In the event that a party wishes to dispute as an issue of fact whether the Postal Service properly has calculated
Express Mail costs or volumes (either before or after its proposed changes), or wishes to dispute whether the change
in the market for expedited delivery services cited by the Postal Service has actually occurred, or wishes to dispute
whether the rates proposed by the Postal Service are a reasonable response to the change in the market for expedited
delivery services or are consistent with the policies of the Postal Reorganization Act, that party shall file with
the Commission a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
request for a hearing within 28 days of the date that the Postal Service files its request. The request for hearing shall
state with specificity the fact or facts set forth in the Postal Service's filing that the party disputes, and when
possible, what the party believes to be the true fact or facts and the evidence it intends to provide in support of its
position. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) The Commission will not hold hearings on a request made pursuant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to &sect;&sect;3001.57 through 3001.57c unless it determines that there is a genuine issue of material fact to be
resolved, and that a hearing is needed to resolve this issue. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Whether or not a hearing is held, the Commission may request 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
briefs and/or argument on an expedited schedule, but in any circumstance it will issue its recommended decision as
promptly as is consistent with its statutory responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) In order to assist in the rapid development of an adequate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evidentiary record, all participants may file appropriate discovery requests on other participants as soon as an
Express Mail Market Response Rate Request is filed. Answers to such discovery requests will be due within 10 days.
Objections to such discovery requests must be made within 10 days in the form of a Motion to Excuse from Answering, with
service on the questioning participant made by hand, facsimile, or expedited delivery. Responses to Motions to Excuse
from Answering must be submitted within seven days, and should such a motion be denied, the answers to the discovery
in question are due within seven days of the denial thereof. It is the Commission's intention that parties resolve
discovery disputes informally between themselves whenever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible. The Commission, therefore, encourages the party receiving discovery requests considered to be unclear
or objectionable to contact counsel for the party filing the discovery requests whenever further explanation is
needed, or a potential discovery dispute might be resolved by means of such communication. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) If, either on its own motion, or after having received a request for a hearing, the Commission concludes that there
exist one or more genuine issues of material fact and that a hearing is needed, the Commission shall expedite the conduct
of such record evidentiary hearings to meet both the need to respond promptly to changed circumstances in the market
and the standards of 5 U.S.C. &sect;556 and 557. The procedural schedule, subject to change as described in paragraph
(e) (6) of this section, is as follows: Hearings on the Postal Service case will begin 35 days after the filing of an Express
Mail Market Response Rate Request; parties may file evidence either in support of or in opposition to the Postal Service
proposal 49 days after the filing; hearings on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
parties' evidence will begin 56 days after the filing; briefs will be due 70 days after the filing; and reply briefs
will be due 77 days after the filing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) The Presiding Officer may adjust any of the schedule dates prescribed in paragraph (e)(5) of this section in the
interests of fairness, or to assist in the development of an adequate evidentiary record. Requests for the opportunity
to present evidence to rebut a submission by a participant other than the Postal Service should be filed within three
working days of the receipt of that material into the evidentiary record, and should include a description of the evidence
to be offered and the amount of time needed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prepare and present it. Requests for additional time will be reviewed with consideration as to whether the requesting
participant has exercised due diligence, and whether the requesting participant has been unreasonably delayed
from fully understanding the proposal.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Commission is soliciting suggestions from interested persons regarding potential mechanisms for expediting
its proceedings conducted under 39 U.S.C. 3624(a), which requires ``the opportunity for a hearing on the record under
sections 556 and 557 of title 5 *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The Commission's rules currently provide for the application
of streamlined procedures to certain categories of Postal Service requests, such as proposals to effect mail classification
changes that are experimental in character. See 39 CFR 3001.67, 3001.67a through .67d.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In appropriate instances, the Commission has also implemented streamlined procedures in the form of Special Rules
of Practice adopted for individual postal rate and mail classification dockets. The proposed rulemaking contemplated
by the Commission would consider suggested additions to the permanent Rules of Practice and Procedure (39 CFR Part
3001) for the purpose of streamlining the procedures employed in additional categories of postal rate and mail classification
proceedings.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Postal Reorganization Act requires the Commission to afford the opportunity for a formal, on-the-record hearing
under sections 556 and 557 of title 5 in several categories of proceedings: those involving Postal Service requests
for changes in postal rates and mail classifications (39 U.S.C. 3624(a)); those involving Postal Service proposals
to make a change in the nature of postal services that will generally affect service on a nationwide or substantially
nationwide basis (39 U.S.C. 3661(c)); and complaint proceedings under 39 U.S.C. 3662 that concern postal rate or
mail classification matters. In proceedings initiated by a Postal Service request to change rates pursuant to section
3622, the Commission is obliged to transmit its recommended decision ``no later than 10 months after receiving any
such request[,]'' with a narrow exception for instances of Postal Service recalcitrance. 39 U.S.C. 3624 (c)(1) and
(c)(2). In order to conduct proceedings with the utmost expedition consistent with procedural fairness to the parties,
section 3624(b) authorizes the Commission to adopt rules for expediting its dockets to which the requirements of
5 U.S.C. 556 and 557 apply. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to the special-purpose procedural streamlining rules cited in the Summary, the Commission has pursued
expedition in its formal, on-the-record proceedings through the adoption of Special Rules of Practice and expedited
procedural schedules. For example, in the recently concluded omnibus rate proceeding, Docket No. R94&hyph;1, the
Commission expedited the discovery process by shortening the permanent rule's 20-day deadline for responses to
14 days. The Commission also expedited the procedural schedule by reducing the interval between oral argument in
the case and the Commission's rendition of an Opinion and Recommended Decision. By these and other means, the Commission
completed the R94&hyph;1 proceeding less than nine months after receiving the Postal Service's request. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It must be noted that Docket No. R94&hyph;1 was not a typical omnibus rate case, in that it involved considerably less
than the usual spectrum of ratemaking and mail classification issues. Nonetheless, the expedition with which the
Commission succeeded in hearing and deciding the R94&hyph;1 case suggests that appropriate forms of procedural
streamlining, regularized in the Commission's rules of practice, may enable similar results in future proceedings.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some forms of procedural streamlining may involve alterations in the terms of existing rules of practice. For example,
replacement of the current 20-day deadline for discovery responses (see 39 CFR 3001.25(b), .26(b), .27(b)) with
the 14-day interval adopted in the Special Rules of Practice in Docket No. R94&hyph;1 could serve to shorten the discovery
phase of most proceedings. Similarly, conversion of oral argument before the Commission (see 39 CFR 3001.37) into
an extraordinary procedure not usually employed could expedite the decisional phase of Commission proceedings
under section 3624. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other avenues of expedition may require more fundamental changes in the rules of practice, including the adoption
of new requirements and procedures. One model of procedural streamlining for consideration of Postal Service rate
requests is contained in draft legislation introduced in the 102nd Congress. S. 946, one of four postal reform bills
jointly sponsored by Senators Stevens and Pryor, would have decreased the statutory period for the Commission's
consideration of Postal Service rate requests to 265 days, while introducing several mandatory procedures to facilitate
an expedited proceeding. These procedures included: (1) Requiring the Postal Service to announce its intent to file
a rate case between 20 and 40 days in advance, and to enhance the information the Service files annually with the Commission,
to better prepare the Commission and interested parties for the actual filing; (2) requiring the Service to provide
information on its current financial condition, base year costs, revenues and volumes, and other detailed information
bearing on its forthcoming rate request at least 30 days before a request is filed; and (3) directing the Commission
to establish the most expeditious schedule possible for discovery in such proceedings. S. 946, 102d Cong., 1st Sess.
(1991); see 137 Cong. Rec. S. 5154&hyph;57 (daily ed. April 25, 1991). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties are invited to address these and other potential means of streamlining the Commission's proceedings
under section 3624, consistent with procedural fairness and the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.
The Commission encourages interested parties to address the questions listed below, although other germane comments
are also welcome. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. What category or categories of Commission proceedings subject to the requirements of 39 U.S.C. 3624(a) should
be candidates for procedural streamlining? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. What additional undertakings or obligations on the part of the United States Postal Service would be reasonable
and appropriate to the more expeditious completion of such proceedings? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Which procedures currently available to parties other than the Postal Service under the Commission's rules of
practice and procedure (39 CFR part 3001) for such proceedings could be curtailed or foreshortened in the interest
of expedition, consistent with due process and the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act?

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
for the purpose of correcting deficiencies and adding requirements for the control of volatile organic compounds
from surface coating, pneumatic rubber tire manufacturing, graphic arts, and synthetic organic chemical manufacturing
industry equipment leaks. In the final rules section of this 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
, EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this
as a noncontroversial SIP revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is
set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further
activity is contemplated in relation to this rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be
withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule.
EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action
should do so at this time.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of March 9, 1994 (59 FR 11122), EPA issued a proposed rule under section 6(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)
to prohibit the manufacture, processing, and distribution in commerce of certain lead- and zinc-containing fishing
sinkers. In that proposal, the Agency stated that it would hold an informal hearing if persons requested time for oral
comment. EPA received requests for a hearing. A notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 of September 19, 1994 (59 FR 47832), announced a hearing for November 30, and December 1, 1994. The hearing was subsequently
held, and as part of the hearing process, reply comments could be submitted through December 15, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA received requests seeking to extend the reply comment period deadline of December 15, 1994, for a period of time
after the availability of the hearing transcript. EPA expects to receive the public hearing transcript no later than
December 23, 1994. Therefore, in order to give all interested persons the opportunity to review the hearing transcript
before submitting reply comments, EPA has decided to reopen the reply comment period. Written reply comments must
now be received on or before January 6, 1995, and shall be restricted to comments on: (1) Other comments; (2) material
in the hearing record; and (3) material which was not and could not reasonably have been available to the commenting
party a sufficient time before main comments were due. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A person may assert a claim of business confidentiality for any comments submitted to EPA in connection with the proposed
rule. Any person who submits a comment that contains information claimed as confidential, must also submit a nonconfidential
version. Any claim of confidentiality must accompany the information when it is submitted to EPA. Persons may claim
information as confidential by circling, bracketing, or underlining it, and marking it with ``CONFIDENTIAL'' or
some other appropriate designation. EPA will disclose information subject to a claim of business confidentiality
only to the extent permitted by section 14 of TSCA and 40 CFR part 2, subpart B. If a person does not assert a claim of confidentiality
for information in comments at the time it is submitted to EPA, the Agency will put the comments in the public docket
without further notice to that person.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The domestic and foreign groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the GOA are managed by NMFS according
to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska. The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery
Management Council (Council) under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The FMP
is implemented by regulations for the foreign fishery at 50 CFR part 611 and for the U.S. fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672,
676, and 677. General regulations that also pertain to the U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action proposes for the 1995 fishing year: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Specifications of total allowable catch (TAC) for each groundfish target species category in the GOA and apportionments
thereof among domestic annual processing (DAP), joint venture processing (JVP), total allowable level of foreign
fishing (TALFF), and reserves; (2) apportionments of reserves to DAP; (3) apportionments of the sablefish TAC to
vessels using hook-and-line and trawl gear; (4) apportionments of pollock TAC; (5) apportionments of Pacific cod
TAC; (6) ``other species'' TAC; (7) halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits; and (8) seasonal allocations
of the halibut PSC limits. A discussion of each of these measures follows. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Comments on the proposed 1995 specifications are invited from the public through (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
DATES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). After again consulting with the Council, NMFS will publish final specifications for the 1995 fishing year in the

1. Proposed Establishment of TACs and Apportionments Thereof Among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and Reserves 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii), NMFS, after consultation with the Council, publishes in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 proposed specifications of annual TACs and interim harvest limits. These proposed specifications indicate apportionments
of TACs among DAP, JVP, reserves, and TALFF for each target species and the ``other species'' category. The sum of the
TACs for all species must fall within the combined optimum yield (OY) range, of 116,000&hyph;800,000 metric tons
(mt), established for these species. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Species TACs are apportioned initially among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserves under &sect;&sect;611.92(c)(1) and
672.20(a)(2). DAP amounts are intended for harvest by U.S. fishermen for delivery and sale to U.S. processors. JVP
amounts are intended for joint ventures in which U.S. fishermen deliver their catches to foreign processors at sea.
TALFF amounts are intended for harvest by foreign fishermen. Existing harvesting and processing capacity of the
U.S. industry is capable of utilizing the entire 1995 TAC specification for GOA groundfish. Therefore, the Council
recommended that DAP equal TAC for each species category, resulting in no proposed amounts of TALFF or JVP for the 1995
fishing year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The reserves for the GOA are 20 percent of the TACs for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish target species categories, and
``other species.'' If necessary, these reserve amounts may be set aside for possible apportionment to DAP and/or
to JVP if the initial apportionments prove inadequate. Reserves that are not apportioned to DAP or JVP may be reapportioned
to TALFF. Given that the GOA groundfish TACs have been utilized fully by DAP since 1987, NMFS has reapportioned all
the reserves to DAP.

Council met from September 28 to October 5, 1994, to review scientific information concerning groundfish stocks.
The preliminary SAFE Report, dated September 1994, prepared and presented to the Council by the GOA Plan Team (Plan
Team), summarizes the best available scientific information.

The September 1994 SAFE Report contains revised stock assessments for all species except sablefish and demersal
shelf rockfish (DSR). New assessments for these two species are discussed in the final SAFE Report issued in November.
New stock assessment models were used in the assessments for Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, and thornyhead rockfish.
Additional information, based on 1993 trawl surveys, was presented for pollock, slope rockfish, Pacific ocean perch
(POP), pelagic shelf rockfish, and the flatfish groups. Details of the assessments can be found in the September 1994
SAFE Report.

Substantial changes to the 1995 acceptable biological catches (ABCs), compared to 1994 ABCs, occurred for pollock,
Pacific cod, POP, arrowtooth flounder, and shallow-water flatfish. Changes to the 1995 ABCs also occurred for deep-water
flatfish, flathead sole, other rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, thornyhead rockfish, and Atka mackerel. The 1995
ABCs for rex sole, shortraker/rougheye and northern rockfish remain similar to the 1994 ABCs.

The Plan Team recommended an ABC for pollock of 65,360 mt, down from 109,300 mt in 1994. The Plan Team chose a more conservative
exploitation strategy for this stock because of recent trends in poor recruitment of GOA pollock and because of ecosystem
considerations. The stock biomass for pollock has been declining for a number of years and even with the more conservative
exploitation strategy, the biomass is still likely to go below the threshold for sustainable yield. The Scientific
and Statistical Committee (SSC) concurred with the Plan Team's recommended ABC and the Council accepted the SSC's
recommendation.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An ABC of 103,000 mt was recommended by the Plan Team for Pacific cod. The 1995 ABC is double the 1994 ABC for this stock
because a higher natural mortality rate was assumed and because the stock assessment model was changed. The model
for assessing this stock was changed to a stock synthesis model, which resulted in a higher estimate of exploitable
biomass. The SSC expressed some concern over the large increase in ABC and recommended a range from the 1994 ABC level
of 50,400 mt to the Plan Team's recommended 1995 level of 103,000 mt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new biomass estimate for POP resulted in a 1995 ABC that is more than twice the 1994 ABC. Age composition data also indicate
an exceptionally strong 1986 year class, especially in the Central and Western Regulatory areas. New biomass estimates
for POP indicate that POP is close to the rebuilding level, as established by the POP rebuilding plan, authorized under
Amendment 32 to the FMP. The assessment authors determined an ABC of 8,830 mt, which was then adjusted according to
established guidelines by the Plan Team, to provide a buffer between the ABC and the overfishing level. The resulting
ABC was 6,800 mt. The SSC did not agree with the guidelines for the downward adjustment of the ABC and recommended an
ABC of 8,830 mt, equal to the overfishing level. The SSC believes that adjusting the overfishing level upwards to create
a buffer between ABC and overfishing might be more appropriate. The Council accepted the SSC recommendation and set
the 1995 ABC at 8,830 mt. The TAC amount for POP is set by the POP rebuilding plan and is not affected by the ABC amount.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The new biomass estimates for shallow-water flatfish were greater than the previous estimates and the 1995 ABC (52,270
mt) is greater than the 1994 ABC (34,420 mt). The 1995 ABC for arrowtooth flounder (198,130 mt) is lower than the 1994
ABC (236,240 mt), based on new biomass estimates. New survey information indicated declines in biomass levels for
some flatfish groups, resulting in associated declines in ABCs. The 1995 ABCs for deep-water flatfish (14,590 mt)
and for flathead sole (28,790 mt) were both lower than the 1994 ABCs (16,510 mt and 35,850 mt, respectively). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A new assessment model for thornyhead rockfish resulted in a Plan Team ABC recommendation of 2,320 mt, which is double
the 1994 ABC. Because rockfish are vulnerable to over-exploitation and because the model is new, the SSC recommended
phasing in the new ABC. A 4-year stair-step approach to implementation of the Plan Team's recommended ABC was recommended
so that the new assessment model can be reevaluated after the 1996 trawl survey. For 1995, the ABC was set at 5/8 of the
Plan Team's ABC because the 1994 ABC was about one-half the new ABC. This procedure results in a 1995 ABC of 1,450 mt.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1995 ABC for Atka mackerel, recommended by the SSC and accepted by the Council, is similar to the 1994 ABC. The Plan
Team recommended an ABC of 6,480 mt. However, in 1994, when Atka mackerel was separated from the ``other species''
category, the Plan Team's calculated 1994 ABC was reduced to 3/6. This reduction factor would increase by 1/6 per year
(stair stepping) and be multiplied by subsequent annual calculated ABCs. The SSC recommended that this procedure
be continued to maintain consistency of approach for the management of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI)
management area and the GOA Atka mackerel resource. Continuing the stair-step approach for the 1995 fishing year,
the calculated ABC should be reduced to 4/6 of the Plan Team's 1995 ABC. Using this approach, the SSC recommended an
ABC of 4,300 mt. This approach also takes into account concern about survey variability and concerns for northern
fur seals and Steller sea lions, which feed on Atka mackerel. Even though the stair-step approach provides some protection
to this stock, the SSC expressed concern that other management measures be considered to reduce the potential impacts
on marine mammals.

New assessments for other rockfish, northern rockfish, shortraker/rougheye and pelagic shelf rockfish resulted
in slightly lower 1995 ABCs for these groups, compared to the 1994 ABCs. Because there were no new assessments for DSR
and sablefish at this time, the ABCs for these two groups remain unchanged. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Plan Team and the SSC recommended removing redbanded rockfish (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Sebastes babcocki
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
) from the DSR group and placing it in the ``other rockfish'' category because this species can constrain the DSR fishery
and it is caught as bycatch in the ``other rockfish'' category. This would not affect the ABC recommendation for either
group. The Plan Team had recommended removing black rockfish from the pelagic shelf rockfish group but the SSC did
not agree, because not enough biological data exist on black rockfish biomass. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The total ABC amount recommended by the SSC and accepted by the Council was a range from 481,090_533,690 mt. The range
accounted for the recommended ABC range in the Pacific cod stock. The total TAC amount recommended by the Advisory
Panel (AP) was 326,515 mt. The AP recommended a 1995 TAC equal to the 1995 ABCs, as recommended by the SSC, for pollock,
rex sole, sablefish, shortraker/rougheye, other rockfish, northern rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, DSR, and
thornyhead rockfish. The AP recommendation for a 1995 TAC for Pacific cod was equal to the upper end of the range (103,000
mt) recommended by the SSC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AP recommended a 1995 TAC that was lower than the 1995 ABC recommended by the SSC, and that was equal to the 1994 TAC,
for deep-water flatfish, flathead sole, shallow-water flatfish, and Atka mackerel. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the POP biomass was higher than in 1994, the 1995 TAC for POP is higher than in 1994. As mentioned above, the TAC
for POP is specified in the rebuilding plan and the apportionments are based on the biomass distribution in each of
the GOA regulatory areas. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The AP increased the 1995 apportionment from the 1994 TAC for arrowtooth flounder in the Central Regulatory area by
5,000 mt, to 25,000 mt. The TAC amount for arrowtooth flounder in the other regulatory areas is the same as the 1994 TAC
amount, resulting in a total of TAC of 35,000 mt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council considered information in the SAFE Report, recommendations from its SSC and its AP, as well as public testimony.
The Council then accepted the ABCs as recommended by the SSC and, with the exception of slope rockfish, the TACs as recommended
by the AP. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council chose a TAC range for ``other rockfish'' that ranged from the 1994 TAC amount of 2,235 mt to the 1995 ABC amount
of 6,930 mt. This range was recommended to recognize the need for conservative management of this group. However,
NMFS must manage the fisheries based on a single TAC amount, rather than on a range of numbers. NMFS has chosen to propose
a TAC of 6,930 mt, which is the number proposed by the AP and is the ABC that was recommended from the 1994 stock assessment.
Even though this number will be used to establish the 1995 interim TAC until the final specifications are implemented,
no practical difference exists in choosing any number within the Council's recommended TAC range. The hook-and-line
fisheries typically do not harvest slope rockfish and the trawl fisheries for rockfish do not open until July 1, by
which time the final specifications will be published. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NMFS also revises the Council's recommendation for the 1995 flathead sole TAC. The Council approved the AP recommendation
of adopting the 1994 TAC amounts for flathead sole for the 1995 TAC amounts. In the GOA Eastern Regulatory Area, the
1994 TAC amount (3,000 mt) is higher than the Council's recommended 1995 ABC (2,740 mt). To maintain consistency with
the accepted policy of setting TACs lower than or equal to ABC amounts, NMFS is proposing to establish a 1995 TAC of 2,740
mt for the Eastern Regulatory Area. This number is equal to the 1995 ABC recommended by the Plan Team and the SSC and approved
by the Council. Adjustment of the flathead sole TAC in the Eastern Regulatory Area changes the total 1995 flathead
sole TAC to 9,740 mt. This also results in a revised ``other species'' TAC amount of 15,535 mt and a revised 1995 total
GOA TAC of 326,242 mt. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1995 ABCs, TACs and interim TACs, as well as the ABC and TAC apportionments, are shown in Table 1.

2. Proposed Apportionment of Reserves to DAP 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Regulations implementing the FMP require 20 percent of each TAC for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish species, and the
``other species'' category be set aside in reserves for possible apportionment at a later date (&sect;672.20(a)(2)(ii)).
Consistent with &sect;672.20(a)(2)(iii), NMFS is proposing to apportion the 1995 reserves for each of the four species
categories to DAP, anticipating that domestic harvesters and processors have established markets for these species
and should be provided the opportunity to realize revenues from the harvest of the full DAP amounts so specified. Specifications
of DAP shown in Table 1 reflect apportioned reserves.

3. Proposed Apportionment of the Sablefish TACs to Users of Hook-and-Line and Trawl Gear 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under &sect;672.24(c), sablefish TACs for each of the regulatory areas and districts are assigned to hook-and-line
and trawl gear. In the Central and Western Regulatory Areas, 80 percent of the TAC is allocated to hook-and-line gear
and 20 percent is allocated to trawl gear. In the Eastern Regulatory Area, 95 percent of the TAC is assigned to hook-and-line
gear and 5 percent is assigned to trawl gear. The trawl gear allocation in the Eastern Regulatory Area may only be used
as bycatch to support directed fisheries for other target species. Sablefish caught in the GOA with gear other than
hook-and-line or trawl must be treated as prohibited species and may not be retained. Table 2 shows the assignments
of the proposed 1995 sablefish TACs between hook-and-line and trawl gears.

4. Proposed Apportionments of Pollock TAC 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In the GOA, pollock is apportioned by area and season. These amounts are further apportioned between inshore and offshore
components. Regulations at &sect;672.20(a)(2)(iv) require that the TAC for pollock in the combined Western/Central
Regulatory Areas (W/C) be apportioned among statistical areas Shumagin (61), Chirikof (62), and Kodiak (63) in proportion
to known distribution of the pollock biomass. This measure was intended to provide spatial distribution of the pollock
harvest as a sea lion protection measure. Each statistical area apportionment is further divided equally into the
four calendar quarters. Within any fishing year, any unharvested amount of any quarterly allowance of pollock TAC
is added in equal proportions to the quarterly allowances of following quarters, resulting in a sum for each quarter
not to exceed 150 percent of the initial quarterly allowance. Similarly, harvests in excess of a quarterly allowance
of TAC are deducted in equal proportions from the remaining quarterly allowances of that fishing year. The Eastern
Regulatory Area proposed TAC of 3,360 mt is not allocated among smaller areas, or quarterly. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations at &sect;672.20(a)(2)(v)(A) require that the DAP apportionment for pollock in all regulatory areas
and all quarterly allowances thereof be divided into inshore and offshore components. The inshore component is apportioned
100 percent of the pollock DAP in each regulatory area after subtraction of amounts that are determined by the Director,
Alaska Region, NMFS, (Regional Director) to be necessary to support the bycatch needs of the offshore component in
directed fisheries for other groundfish species. At this time, these bycatch amounts are unknown, and will be determined
during the fishing year. The proposed distribution of pollock within the combined W/C GOA is shown in Table 3, except
that inshore and offshore component apportionments of pollock are not shown.

Under &sect;672.20(f), annual Pacific halibut PSC mortality limits are established for trawl and hook-and-line
gear and may be established for pot gear. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its September 1994 meeting, the Council recommended that, for 1995, NMFS re-establish 1994 PSC limits of 2,000
mt and 750 mt for the trawl and hook-and-line gear fisheries, respectively, with 10 mt of the hook-and-line limit allocated
to the DSR fishery in the Southeast Outside District and the remainder to other hook-and-line gear fisheries. As in
1994, the Council proposes to exempt pot gear from halibut limits for 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
At its September 1994 meeting, the Council also recommended that NMFS initiate rulemaking that would authorize exemption
of the hook-and-line sablefish fishery from the halibut PSC limit. The Council recommended this because of the 1995
implementation of the sablefish and halibut Individual Fishing Quota (IFQ) program, which would allow legal-sized
halibut to be retained in the sablefish fishery. NMFS is preparing a proposed rule to implement the Council's recommendation.
The proposed rule would also specify a reduced halibut PSC limit for the 1995 GOA hook-and-line gear fisheries other
than sablefish. The Council recommended that the trawl fishery apportionment of the 1995 halibut bycatch mortality
limit (2,000 mt) remain unchanged from 1994.

In 1994, NMFS approved a rule that authorizes separate apportionments of the trawl halibut bycatch mortality limit
between trawl fisheries for deep-water and shallow-water species (59 FR 38132, July 27, 1994). These apportionments
are divided seasonally to avoid seasonally high halibut bycatch rates.

NMFS preliminarily concurs in the Council's 1995 recommendations. Some changes may be made in the seasonal, gear
type and fishing-complex apportionments of halibut PSC limits for the final 1995 specifications. NMFS considers
the following types of information as presented by, and summarized from, the preliminary 1994 SAFE Report, or from
public comment and testimony.

The best available information on estimated halibut bycatch is available from data collected in 1994 by NMFS-certified
observers. The calculated halibut bycatch mortality by trawl, hook-and-line, and pot gear through November 11,
1994, is 2,221 mt, 752 mt, and 4 mt, respectively, for a total of 2,977 mt. Halibut bycatch restrictions seasonally
constrained trawl gear fisheries during the first, second, third and fourth quarters of the fishing year. Trawling,
with the exception of trawling for pollock with pelagic trawl gear, was closed in 1994 from March 21 to March 31 for the
shallow-water species complex (59 FR 13894, March 24, 1994); from April 22 to June 30 for the deep-water species complex
(59 FR 21946, April 28, 1994); from May 19 to June 30 for the shallow-water species complex (59 FR 26761, May 24, 1994);
from August 15 to September 30 for the shallow-water complex (59 FR 42776, August 19, 1994); and from August 29 to September
30 for the deep-water complex (59 FR 45239, September 1, 1994), as a result of halibut PSC seasonal allowances. The
fourth quarter halibut PSC allowance was reached on October 29 (59 FR 55066, November 3, 1994). Hook-and-line gear
was closed to directed fishing for all but DSR on May

28 to December 31, 1994 (59 FR 17737, April 14, 1994; 59 FR 43296, August 23, 1993). The sablefish hook-and-line gear
fishery was reopened for a 48-hour period in September, 1994, concurrent with the Pacific halibut fishery (59 FR 44944,
August 31, 1994).

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The amount of groundfish that trawl or hook-and-line gear might have harvested, if halibut PSC had not been seasonally
limiting in 1994, is unknown. However, lacking market incentives, some amounts of groundfish will not be harvested,
regardless of halibut PSC bycatch availability.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
At its September 1994 meeting, the Council recommended lower 1995 ABCs than 1994 ABCs for pollock, deep-water flatfish,
rex sole, flathead sole, arrowtooth flounder, other rockfish, northern rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, shortraker/rougheye,
and Atka mackerel. Higher 1995 ABCs, as compared to the 1994 ABCs, were recommended for Pacific cod, shallow-water
flatfish, POP, and thornyhead rockfish. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 1995 ABCs for DSR and sablefish are unchanged from 1994 levels. More information on these proposed changes is included
in the preliminary SAFE Report, dated September 1994, and in the AP, SSC, and Council minutes from the September 1994
meeting.

(C) Expected Changes in Groundfish Catch 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The total of the proposed 1995 specified TACs for the GOA is 326,242 mt, which represents 107 percent of the sum of TACs
for 1994 (304,589 mt). Significant changes in TACs for pollock, Pacific cod, POP, other rockfish, shallow-water
rockfish, and arrowtooth flounder are proposed. Increased TACs for some groups could result in increased halibut
mortality associated with those fisheries. The changes in pollock TACs are not expected to affect halibut bycatches,
because most of the pollock harvest in the GOA is accomplished with pelagic trawls that experience low bycatch rates
of halibut.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The stock assessment for 1993 conducted by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) indicates that the
total exploitable biomass of Pacific halibut in the BSAI management area and the GOA together was 300.4 million lb
(136,236 mt) using the standard assessment methods and 249.8 million lb (113,288 mt) when discounting the effects
of an upturn in catch per unit effort for 1992 and 1993. This represents a decline in biomass of 12&hyph;15 percent from
the previous stock assessment, a rate that is higher than the 5&hyph;10 percent annual decline observed in previous
years. Exploitable biomass was estimated at 219.6 million lb (99,592 mt) for the GOA areas, a decrease of 13 percent
with respect to the 1992 biomass. Recruitment was the lowest in 20 years, but was consistent with cyclical patterns
of recruitment that have occurred over the last 50 years. The low recruitment exhibited in recent years can be expected
to contribute to a continued decline in the overall stock at a rate of 10&hyph;15 percent over the next several years.
Some changes may be made to the IPHC Report in November.

(E) Potential Impacts of Expected Fishing for Groundfish on Halibut Stocks and U.S. Halibut Fisheries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Halibut fisheries will be adjusted to account for the overall halibut PSC mortality limit established for groundfish
fisheries. The 1995 groundfish fisheries are expected to use the entire proposed halibut PSC limit of 2,750 mt. The
allowable directed commercial catch is determined by accounting for the recreational catch, waste, and bycatch
mortality, and then providing the remainder to the directed fishery. How this affects the directed fishery depends
on the constant exploitable yield (CEY) determined by the IPHC. Therefore, if the PSC limit of 2,750 mt is instituted
for the 1995 fishery, the results could be either positive or negative to the directed halibut fishery, depending
on whether the CEY is higher or lower than it was in the previous year's fishery.

(F) Methods Available For, and Costs of, Reducing Halibut Bycatches in Groundfish Fisheries 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Methods available for reducing halibut bycatch include (1) reducing amounts of groundfish TACs, (2) reducing halibut
bycatch rates through a Vessel Incentive Program, (3) modifying gear, (4) changing groundfish fishing seasons,
and (5) instituting individual transferable quota programs designed to reduce the derby-style fishing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Reductions in groundfish TACs provide no incentives for fishermen to reduce bycatch rates. Costs that would be imposed
on fishermen as a result of reducing TACs depend on species and amounts of groundfish foregone. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Trawl vessels carrying observers for purposes of complying with the Observer Plan are subject to the Vessel Incentive
Program. The program encourages trawl fishermen to avoid high halibut bycatch rates while conducting groundfish
fisheries by specifying bycatch rate standards for various target fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Current regulations require groundfish pots to have halibut exclusion devices to reduce halibut bycatches. Resulting
low bycatch and mortality rates of halibut in pot fisheries have justified exempting pot gear from PSC limits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulations also define pelagic trawl gear in a manner intended to reduce bycatch of halibut by displacing fishing
effort off the bottom of the sea floor when certain halibut bycatch levels are reached during the fishing year. The
definition provides standards for physical conformation and also for performance of the trawl gear in terms of crab
bycatch (58 FR 39680, July 26, 1993). Furthermore, all hook-and-line vessel operators are required to employ careful
release measures when handling halibut bycatch. This measure is intended to reduce handling mortality, increase
the amount of groundfish harvested under the available halibut mortality bycatch limits, and possibly lower overall
halibut bycatch mortality in groundfish fisheries. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Halibut bycatch has been reduced by changes in some groundfish fishing seasons. In 1994, the sablefish hook-and-line
season started May 18, and the rockfish trawl fishery was delayed until the third quarter, July 1. These delays postponed
the start of the sablefish and rockfish fisheries to times when seasonal halibut bycatch rates are lower. In 1995,
the season start date for sablefish, under the IFQ program, will be March 1 (&sect;676.23(b)). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The anticipated implementation in 1995 of the sablefish/halibut IFQ program should reduce the halibut discard mortality
in the sablefish fishery because any legal-sized halibut caught by vessels with quota-share holders onboard must
be retained. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Methods available for reducing halibut bycatch listed above will be reviewed by NMFS and the Council to determine
their effectiveness. Changes will be initiated, as necessary, in response to this review or to public testimony and
comment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Consistent with the goals and objectives of the FMP to reduce halibut bycatches while providing an opportunity to
harvest the groundfish OY, NMFS proposes the assignments of 2,000 mt and 750 mt of halibut PSC mortality limits to trawl
and hook-and-line gear, respectively. While these limits would reduce the harvest quota for commercial halibut
fishermen, NMFS has determined that they would not result in unfair allocation to any particular user group. NMFS
recognizes that some halibut bycatch will occur in the groundfish fishery, but expansion of the Vessel Incentive
Program, required modifications to gear, implementation of the IFQ program, and changes in the season start date
for some fisheries are intended to reduce adverse impacts on halibut fishermen while promoting the opportunity to
achieve the OY from the groundfish fishery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As mentioned above, NMFS is pursuing rulemaking that would authorize the annual exemption of the sablefish hook-and-line
gear fishery from halibut bycatch restrictions. This action was recommended by the Council based on the anticipation
of reduced halibut discard mortality in the fishery under the IFQ program and to support the first-year implementation
of the IFQ program. This action would minimize competition within the sablefish hook-and-line fleet for halibut
bycatch before individual sablefish quota-share amounts are harvested.

8. Proposed Seasonal Allocations of the Halibut PSC Limits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Under &sect;672.20(f)(2)(iii), NMFS proposes to allocate seasonally the halibut PSC limits based on recommendations
from the Council. The FMP requires that the following information be considered by the Council in recommending seasonal
allocations of halibut: (1) Seasonal distribution of halibut, (2) seasonal distribution of target groundfish species
relative to halibut distribution, (3) expected halibut bycatch needs on a seasonal basis relevant to changes in halibut
biomass and expected catches of target groundfish species, (4) expected bycatch rates on a seasonal basis, (5) expected
changes in directed groundfish fishing seasons, (6) expected actual start of fishing effort, and, (7) economic effects
of establishing seasonal halibut allocations on segments of the target groundfish industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council recommended the same seasonal allocation of PSC limits for the 1995 fishing year as those in effect during
the 1994 fishing year. The publication of the final 1994 initial groundfish and PSC specifications (59 FR 7647, February
16, 1994) summarizes Council findings with respect to each of the FMP considerations set forth above. At this time,
the Council's findings are unchanged from those set forth for 1994.

Pacific halibut PSC catch limits, and apportionments thereof, are presented in Table 5. Regulations specify that
any overages or shortfalls in PSC catches will be accounted for within the 1995 season. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council did not recommend changes in the seasonal apportionments for the hook-and-line gear fisheries from those
specified in 1994; however, NMFS notes that the opening date of the sablefish fishery is scheduled to change from May
18, in 1994, to March 1, in 1995, under the IFQ program. This change and the Council's proposed exemption of the sablefish
fishery from the 1995 PSC limit may prompt the Council to alter its recommendation for seasonal apportionments at
its December 1994 meeting.

Assumed halibut mortality rates for halibut PSC bycatch in 1995 are based on an average of mortality rates determined
from NMFS-observer data collected during 1992 and 1993, except for the GOA hook-and-line rockfish, for which 1992/93
rates were not available and the rates from 1990 and 1991 were used. Except as noted below, the Council proposed that
revised halibut discard mortality rates recommended by the IPHC be adopted for purposes of monitoring halibut bycatch
mortality limits established for the 1995 groundfish fisheries. The Council's action would establish two separate
mortality rates for the GOA bottom trawl pollock fishery: 54 percent for shoreside operations and 81 percent for offshore
operations. The proposed rate differences for at-sea and shoreside processors result from analyses by the IPHC that
showed that at-sea processing vessels had a significantly higher discard mortality rate than the shorebased operators.
However, NMFS notes that directed fishing for GOA pollock by the offshore component is prohibited under &sect;672.20(a)(2)(v).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The IPHC determined that the careful release measures implemented for vessels using hook-and-line gear did not show
appreciable improvements in mortality rates and has recommended one rate for both observed and unobserved vessels
in the hook-and-line fisheries. This action was approved by the Council. The halibut mortality rates are listed in
Table 7.

For most fisheries, the 1992&hyph;93 averages, on which the 1995 recommendations are based, are somewhat higher
than the actual rate used in 1994. This occurs because the rates used in 1994 were a rollover of the 1993 rates, which
had been derived from data for 1990 and 1991. After the December 1994 Council meeting, NMFS will consider all available
data and will publish preseason assumed halibut mortality rates in the Federal Register

Current regulations at &sect;672.20(c)(1)(ii)(A) require that one-fourth of the preliminary TAC (not including
the reserves and the first quarterly allowance of pollock), one-fourth of the inshore and offshore allocations of
Pacific cod in each regulatory area, and one-fourth of the halibut PSC amounts, take effect on January 1 on an interim
basis and remain in effect until superseded by the final 1995 initial specifications published in the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After consideration of public comments and additional scientific information presented at its December 1994 meeting,
the Council may recommend closures to directed fishing. Additionally, NMFS may implement other closures at the time
the final 1995 initial specifications of groundfish TACs are implemented, or during the 1995 fishing year as necessary
for effective management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under &sect;672.20(b)(1), when NMFS determines, after 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consultation with the Council, that the TAC for any species or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
species group will be fully harvested in the DAP fishery, NMFS may specify, for each calendar year, the PSC limit applicable
to any JVP or TALFF fisheries for that species or species group. Any PSC limit specified shall be for bycatch only and
cannot be retained. Under &sect;672.20(c)(6), if the Regional Director determines that a PSC limit applicable to
a directed JVP or TALFF fishery has been or will be reached, NMFS will publish a closure in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 prohibiting all further JVP or TALFF fishing in all or part of the regulatory area concerned. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Council did not propose any PSC limits for fully utilized groundfish species at its September meeting, and it is
not expected to make such recommendations at its December meeting. Groundfish PSC limits would only have been relevant
if the Council had recommended groundfish apportionments to JVP or TALFF. The Council is not expected to recommend
JVP or TALFF apportionments for the 1995 fishing year.

<SUMMARY>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to amend the regulations for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous waste management under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). EPA is listing, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as hazardous, five wastes generated during the production of dyes and pigments because certain ways 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of disposing of these wastes may present a risk to human health and the environment. EPA also is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing not to list as hazardous six other wastes from this industry, and to defer action on three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes due to insufficient information. The proposal would add the toxic constituents found in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes to the list of constituents that serve as a basis for classifying wastes as hazardous. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
action also describes EPA's policy on making listing determinations, and the risk-based criteria 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used by the Agency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This action is proposed under the authority of Sections 3001(e)(2) and 3001(b)(1) of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), which direct EPA to make a hazardous waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing determination for dye and pigment wastes. If finalized, this regulation would regulate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these wastes as hazardous wastes under Subtitle C of RCRA. Additionally, this action proposes to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designate the wastes proposed for listing as hazardous substances subject to the Comprehensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). EPA is not taking action at this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
time to adjust the one-pound statutory reportable quantities (RQs) for these substances.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Hazardous waste is defined at Section 1004(5) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6903(5). There are two types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of hazardous waste. First, hazardous wastes are those solid wastes which may cause or significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribute to an increase in mortality, serious irreversible illness, or incapacitating reversible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
illness. In addition, hazardous wastes are those solid wastes which may pose a substantial present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly managed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's regulations establishing criteria for listing hazardous wastes are codified at Title 40 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) &sect;261.11 (40 CFR 261.11). Section 261.11 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
states three criteria for identifying characteristics and for listing wastes as hazardous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, wastes may be classified as ``characteristic'' wastes if they have the properties 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
described at 40 CFR 261.21&hyph;24 which would cause them to be classified as having the characteristics 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity or toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Second, wastes may be classified as acutely hazardous if they are fatal to humans at low doses, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
lethal in animal studies at particular doses designated in the regulation, or otherwise capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
causing or significantly contributing to an increase in serious illness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Third, wastes may be listed as hazardous if they contain hazardous constituents identified in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261 and the Agency concludes, after considering eleven factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enumerated in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3), that the waste is capable of posing a substantial present or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly managed. Such wastes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
designated as toxic wastes. A substance is listed in Appendix VIII if it has been shown in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scientific studies to have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or teratogenic effects on humans or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
life forms. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wastes listed as hazardous are subject to federal requirements under RCRA for persons who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generate, transport, treat, store or dispose of such waste. Facilities that must meet the hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste management requirements, including the need to obtain permits to operate, commonly are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
referred to as Subtitle C facilities. Subtitle C is Congress' original statutory designation for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that part of RCRA that directs EPA to issue those regulations for hazardous wastes as may be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
necessary to protect human health or the environment. Thus, facilities like incinerators or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landfills that are required to comply with RCRA requirements for hazardous waste are referred to as Subtitle C incinerators
or landfills. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle C is codified as Subchapter III of Chapter 82 (Solid Waste Disposal) of Volume 42 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States Code (42 U.S.C. 6921 through 6939(e)). EPA standards and procedural regulations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementing Subtitle C are found generally at 40 CFR parts 260 through 272. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Solid wastes that are not hazardous wastes may be disposed of at facilities that are overseen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by state and local governments. These are the so-called Subtitle D facilities. Subtitle D is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Congress' original statutory designation for that part of RCRA that deals with federal assistance to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
state and regional planning efforts for disposal of solid waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle D is codified as Subchapter IV of Chapter 82 (Solid Waste Disposal) of Volume 42 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the United States Code (42 U.S.C. 6941 through 6949(a)). EPA regulations affecting Subtitle D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities are found generally at 40 CFR parts 240 thru 247, and 255 thru 258. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3001(e)(2) of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6921(e)(2)) requires EPA to determine whether to list as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous wastes generated by various chemical production processes, including the production of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dyes and pigments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In June of 1991, EPA entered into a proposed consent decree in a lawsuit filed by the

 Civ. No. 89&hyph;0598 (D.D.C.), hereinafter referred 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to as the settlement agreement), in which the Agency agreed to publish a proposed determination as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to whether or not to list as hazardous certain wastes from the production of dyes and pigments by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
November 30, 1994 and to promulgate a final decision by November 30, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are three major classes of dyes and pigments: Azo/benzidine, anthraquinone, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triarylmethane. The settlement agreement specifies that the listing is to address the azo, monoazo, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diazo, triazo, polyazo, azoic, and benzidine categories of the azo/benzidine dye and pigment class; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the anthraquinone and perylene categories of the anthraquinone dye and pigment class; and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triarylmethane, triphenylmethane, and pyrazolone categories of the triarylmethane dye and pigment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
class. The settlement agreement also specifies that the listing is to address the following types 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of wastes where they are found: spent catalysts, reactor still overheads, vacuum system condensate, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process waters, spent adsorbent, equipment cleaning sludge, product mother liquor, product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standardization filter cake, dust collector filter fines, recovery still bottoms, treated wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effluent, and wastewater treatment sludge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of its regulations implementing Section 3001(e) of RCRA, EPA published a list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous wastes that includes hazardous wastes generated from non-specific sources and a list of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous wastes from specific sources. These lists have been amended several times, and are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
published in 40 CFR 261.31 and 40 CFR 261.32, respectively. In this action, EPA is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
amend 40 CFR 261.32 to add five wastes from specific sources generated during the production of dyes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and pigments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those hazardous constituents that are proposed to be included in Appendix VII to part 261, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Basis for Listing Hazardous Waste, also are proposed to be added to Appendix VIII of Part 261, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list of Hazardous Constituents, if not already included in this list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All hazardous wastes listed under RCRA and codified in 40 CFR 261.31 through 261.33, as well as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any solid waste that exhibits one or more of the characteristics of a RCRA hazardous waste (as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defined in 40 CFR 261.21 through 261.24), are also hazardous substances under the Comprehensive 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended. See CERCLA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 101(14)(C). CERCLA hazardous substances are listed in Table 302.4 at 40 CFR 302.4 along 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with their reportable quantities (RQs). Accordingly, the Agency is proposing to list the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes in this action as CERCLA hazardous substances in Table 302.4 of 40 CFR 302.4. EPA is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
taking action at this time to adjust the one-pound statutory RQs for these substances.

B. EPA's Hazardous Waste Listing Determination Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA believes that it should provide the public with a better understanding of the basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA's listing decisions. Accordingly, EPA presents here the general approach the Agency uses for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining whether to list a waste as hazardous pursuant to 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3). This presentation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
focuses on selection of waste management scenarios used in assessing risk and the use of information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on risk levels in making listing determinations. These elements are an important part of EPA's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
general listing policy and critical aspects to the dyes and pigments listing determination. It is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important to note that this discussion presents EPA's general listing policy and is not a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking. The Agency may take action at variance with this general policy. The Agency is seeking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on its policy in order to get input from the public, not in order to promulgate binding 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rules for listing determinations. The Agency will review any comments received and may revise its 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
policy based on such comments. However, the Agency does not intend to respond to comments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The listing criteria described here focus on several aspects of the Agency's listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination process. The discussion is not intended to cover all potential aspects of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations. For example, analyzing population risk is not included in this presentation. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency solicits comment on how population risks could be included as a factor in listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations. The Agency's approach to calculating distributions of individual risk values when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determining ``high end'' risk and the Agency's position on how far into the future it will consider 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk are not covered in today's notice. The Agency solicits comment on these factors and their use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in listing determinations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Currently, risk levels (including carcinogen risk, non-carcinogen risk as determined by hazard quotient (HQ),
and ecological risk) provide one of the principal bases for a listing determination. However, risk levels themselves
do not represent the sole basis for a listing. Other factors generally are weighed in making a listing decision. The
Agency's listing decision policy uses a ``weight-of-evidence'' approach in which calculated risk information
is a key factor. Available risk values are assessed with all other data available to determine whether a waste is or
is not a hazardous waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The criteria for listing wastes as hazardous are described in 40 CFR 261.11. They are presented in two basic parts:
Numeric criteria for acutely hazardous wastes (defined by 40 CFR 261.11(a)(2)); and criteria for toxic wastes (defined
by 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)) containing toxic constituents listed in Appendix VIII to Part 261 (where 11 factors are considered
in determining ``substantial present or potential hazard to human health and the environment'').
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of these 11 factors, seven deal with risk (constituent toxicity, concentration, waste quantity, migration potential,
persistence, degradation product potential, and bioaccumulation potential) and are integrated into the risk values
generated. The other four factors (plausible management, damage cases, coverage of other regulatory programs,
and other factors as may be appropriate) are individual factors that also are considered in a listing determination.
Waste quantity (specifically, ``de minimis'' amounts of waste) also can be a special consideration in making a listing
determination for a lower volume wastestream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Selection of Waste Management Scenarios (261.11(a)(3)(vii)) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted above, one of the many factors that the Agency takes into account is the ``plausible types of improper management
to which the waste could be subjected.'' 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)(vii). Exposures to wastes (and therefore the risks involved)
will vary by waste management practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that a management scenario need not be in use currently to be considered plausible by EPA since
disposal practices can and do change over time. Potential future waste management practices are projected and considered
in the risk analysis, if appropriate. The Agency often projects risks from management that reasonably 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
could
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 be employed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Factors for Projecting a Plausible Waste Management Scenario. There are a number of disposal scenarios for wastes
not hazardous under RCRA that are common across industries. These include municipal and industrial unlined landfills
for solid materials, tanks and unlined surface impoundments for liquids, and boilers for organic solids and liquids.
The Agency will presume that these scenarios are plausible unless circumstances unique to a particular industry
show that one or more is not plausible for that industry. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency notes that there may exist certain disposal scenarios not common across industries that could present
a greater risk than the risk from the common plausible management scenarios mentioned above. An example might be land-spreading
sludge from wastewater treatment facilities. These less common scenarios generally will be considered plausible
only when information on an industry indicates that these disposal methods currently are being practiced, or there
is good reason to believe they might be practiced in the future. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In determining whether one of the common disposal scenarios is not plausible, the Agency will consider factors such
as the following: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Availability of waste management practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There may be practical constraints to the type of waste management practices available to a category of waste generators.
For example, if facilities in an industry have only a limited amount of land available to them, then building large
surface impoundments to handle wastewaters may be highly unlikely and would not be considered plausible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Coverage of the Characterization Program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where all, or at least a large percentage, of facilities in an industrial category can be characterized with respect
to waste management practices, the Agency may be able to do a more refined analysis of the plausibility of facilities
switching from their current waste management practice to a higher risk waste management practice. The Agency may
determine it more appropriate to estimate risk based on current management practices where our analysis shows that
it is unlikely that facilities would switch to another management practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Effect of Other Regulatory Programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Other regulatory programs, for example, the water pollution control program or air pollution regulatory requirements,
can impose legal, technical, or practical restraints on waste management practices. If these requirements restrict
certain practices (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, water treatment requirements technically and practically might preclude treatment in surface impoundments)
the Agency can use this information to consider eliminating that disposal practice from consideration.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
&bull;Management Costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Often, the cost of different management scenarios can be a determinative factor in dictating the plausibility of
waste management scenarios. In the absence of other potential cost factors, such as liability, the plausibility
that a facility would choose a waste management scenario increases as the expense of that management practice decreases.
Conversely, it is more implausible to assume that a firm would chose management activities that impose a higher cost
(where cost includes the likelihood of future potential liabilities.) Cost can be a consideration the Agency uses
in choosing which management scenario to project as a scenario to analyze for determining potential risk of waste
management. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These factors are presented as examples; there may be others appropriate to specific industries. In characterizing
the risks for a wastestream where more than one disposal scenario is plausible, the Agency will use the results of the
risk assessment for the plausible scenario that presents the highest risks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Note that EPA considers the extent to which the plausible management scenario calculated to cause the highest risk
is practiced, or could be practiced. Management practices the Agency believes probably would occur infrequently
may be less determinative in the final listing determination process. As the probability that generators would use
a management practice increases, the greater the weight that set of risk values has in the final listing determination.

2. Risk Levels in Making Listing Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As noted earlier, the Agency's listing determination policy utilizes a ``weight-of-evidence'' approach in which
risk is a key factor. Risk measurements used include carcinogen risk, non-carcinogen risk as determined by hazard
quotient (HQ), and ecological risk. However, risk levels themselves do not necessarily represent the sole basis
for a listing. There can be uncertainty in calculated risk values and so other factors are considered in conjuction
with risk in making a listing decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Use of Risk Levels in a Listing Decision. EPA's current listing determination procedure (illustrated in Figure
1) uses as an initial cancer-risk ``level of concern'' a calculated risk level of 1 &times; 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^5
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (one in one hundred thousand) and/or HQs (and/or environmental risk quotients [EQs]) of 1 at any one point in time.
Note that individual risks can occur at different points in time. For example, a category of wastestream that is both
burned in a boiler by one facility but placed in a landfill by another would be projected to cause exposure through both
the air and the drinking water pathways. It is likely that risks from each source will occur at different times, since
air exposures would probably occur sooner than groundwater exposures. The Agency will take the timing factor into
account when analyzing risk. In accordance with EPA policy, risks from individual carcinogens generally are added
together. Listing decisions from this risk level of concern generally will be as follows.

 or higher, or 1 or higher HQs or EQs for any individual non-carcinogen, or non-carcinogens that elicit adverse effects
on the same target organ, generally will be considered to pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health
and the environment and generally will be listed as hazardous waste. Such wastestreams fall into a category presumptively
assumed to pose sufficient risk to require their listing as hazardous waste. However, even for these wastestreams
there can in some cases be factors which could mitigate the high hazard presumption. These additional factors, explained
below, also will be considered by the Agency in making a final determination.

 or lower, and lower than 1.0 HQs or EQs for any non-carcinogens, generally will be considered not to pose a substantial

Such wastestreams fall into a category presumptively assumed not to pose sufficient risk as to require their listing
as hazardous waste. However, even for these wastestreams, in some cases, there can be factors that could mitigate
the low hazard presumption. These also will be considered by the Agency in making a final determination.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
between samples, and in analytical methodologies, exist. All such variability sources may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
influence the Agency's decision on how much weight to place on data collected as a basis for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Budget constraints or sample availability constraints may limit the size of the database 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for any one wastestream. In such cases, the Agency generally assumes that the sample(s) taken 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are representative of each like wastestream from that category of generator and that the data, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated following a QA/QC plan, are ``good'' data. However, EPA will take uncertainty of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data into account in the listing process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency sometimes relies on analytical measurements that fall below the level of an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyst's ability to quantify with certainty the concentration of the constituent involved 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(these measurements are referred to as ``estimated'' or ``J-values'' in listing determinations). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Analytical methods used by the Agency have been developed with a goal of obtaining quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
25% uncertainty or less) at levels of regulatory concern. Frequently, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analytical measurements may detect the presence of constituents of concern at levels at or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below the analytical method's limit of quantitation. However, for some highly toxic substances 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements of constituents below the limit of quantitation may be of toxicological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significance and, therefore, potential regulatory significance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
limit of quantitation
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 is defined as the level above which results may be obtained with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a specified degree of confidence. In the case of methods which use mass spectrometric 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
measurements, quantitative uncertainty is assigned to measurements below the limit of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitation (although a positive determination of presence is certain) as follows:

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Although the uncertainty of analytical measurements increases as the limit of detection is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approached, the calculated concentrations obtained may represent the best available measurement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the analyte present. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is the Agency's policy on listing determinations that measurements in the range below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the level of quantification but above the level of detection will be used at the reported 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantitation level for risk analysis purposes. However, the Agency generally will consider the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty associated with measurements below the quantitation level and assess the impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that level of uncertainty on a listing decision. Increasing uncertainty of a measurement may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increase the importance of other factors in making a listing determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(2) Certainty in Risk Assessment Methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Uncertainty can exist in the methodologies and data used to conduct both the toxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessments and the fate and transport exposure models employed in risk assessments. Toxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment methods sometimes rely on animal or cellular models to predict a chemical's effect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on humans or animals. Direct toxicity testing of a chemical is not always available. For some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these chemicals, structure/activity relationships can be used to predict the toxicity of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substance involved. In these cases, the Agency considers what degree of uncertainty can exist 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in that analysis when making listing determinations. Similarly, some fate/transport models 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
make use of an increased amount of input data or can involve actual verification. For those 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
models, uncertainty in exposure analysis is decreased. The Agency weighs the relative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
uncertainty of the predictive models when generating risk assessments and making listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determinations.

(3) Coverage by Other Regulatory Programs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Listing decisions can be strongly influenced by the effect of other regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements on the wastestreams involved. Where another Federal or State program or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
RCRA requirements clearly will provide the type of control needed to eliminate the risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with a certain type of waste management, a RCRA listing may be considered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unnecessary or redundant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Other Federal or State programs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If other Federal or State programs clearly regulate risk associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream, listing may not be necessary to eliminate risk. For example, if the Office 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Air and Radiation within EPA has issued an NESHAP to control emissions of a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituent, it may be unnecessary to consider risk from inhalation of that constituent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making listing determinations. In some cases, another regulatory program may be in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process of developing such regulatory requirements. If this program is under statutory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements or Court Order, EPA may consider these regulatory requirements to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forthcoming and, in some cases, may defer to them in listing determinations, even where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such regulatory coverage is several years away. If this program is under no statutory or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal deadline, no deference typically will be given to projected future regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coverage from other programs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(4) Waste Volume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Waste volume is, in fact, part of a risk-level calculation. Risk is projected based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the volume of waste involved. However, volume of waste is also a factor EPA may consider when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the projected risk falls in a marginal risk range. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(5) Evidence of Co-occurrence 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Virtually all wastestreams EPA assesses are complex mixtures of constituents. Where 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
possible, the Agency calculates potential risk for all measured pollutants. Where more than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one risk value for carcinogenicity is calculated, concern about overall wastestream effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
increases and the Agency will consider that risk additive. However, where sampling and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis data show compelling evidence that the constituents cannot or do not occur together in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wastestream or at the receptor, the Agency generally will only consider the risk associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with individual constituents. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(6) Damage Cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For each listing determination, EPA seeks data on damage cases. These are cases in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
some prior waste management practice has resulted in environmental harm. Where there has been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a clear case of harm, the data suggest the management of that waste has already damaged human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health or the environment in some way, and that such damage could occur again. Depending on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the number and severity of the damage cases and the potential for these damages to happen 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
again, adverse damage cases may provide a ``stand alone'' reason for listing the waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Where damage cases appear to contradict the risk analysis, EPA will try to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reason and use that assessment in the overall listing decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
(7) Unknown or Unquantified Risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Not all constituents in a complex wastestream can be analyzed for risk. Hazard data may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not be available either directly or through mechanisms such as structure/activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationships, or they may be in a form which is not considered usable by EPA. In the cases 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
where some constituents are present but no risk levels can be assigned to them, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considers the potential for these constituents to be hazardous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, use of these additional factors is not limited to cases in which the risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels fall between 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and 10
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
^6
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. Pursuant to EPA's listing determination policy ``weight-of-evidence'' approach, the Agency will consider these
factors, as appropriate, even where risk levels 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fall in the presumptive list or presumptive no-list levels.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Confidentiality Claims 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The hazardous waste listings proposed here are based in part upon data claimed as confidential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by certain dye and pigment manufacturers. Although EPA intends to publish information derived from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these data claimed as confidential (to the extent relevant to the proposed listing), the Agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unable to do so at the present time. Therefore, this proposed rule is being published without some 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the information that supports the Agency's proposal. Where that information is missing from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
text, it is noted in the text. Whenever EPA is unable to include pertinent data in a table, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following statement appears in a footnote: ``Relevant data are not included at the present time due 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to business confidentiality concerns.'' EPA is pursuing avenues to allow publication of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, and intends to supplement the public record prior to issuing a final listing.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In today's notice, EPA is proposing to add five wastes generated during the production of dyes and pigments to the lists
of hazardous wastes in 40 CFR 261.32. A summary of the waste groupings proposed for listing are provided below with
their proposed corresponding EPA Hazardous Waste Numbers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has determined that these wastes meet the criteria for listing set out in 40 CFR 261.11. Section II.E. of
this preamble presents waste characterization, waste management, and risk assessment data, which are the bases
for the Agency's proposal to list or not to list the wastes studied in this rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Upon promulgation of these proposed listings, all wastes meeting the listing descriptions would become hazardous
wastes and would require treatment, storage, or disposal at permitted facilities. Residuals from the treatment,
storage, or disposal of the wastes included in this proposed listing also would be classified as hazardous wastes
pursuant to the ``derived-from'' rule (40 CFR 261.3(c)(2)(i)). For example, ash or other residuals from treatment
of the listed wastes would be subject to the hazardous waste regulations. Also, 40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iv) (the ``mixture''
rule) provides that, with certain limited exceptions, any mixture of a listed waste and a solid waste is itself a RCRA
hazardous waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, when these wastes are recycled as described in 40 CFR 261.2(e)(1)(iii) or 261.4(a)(8), they are not solid
wastes and are not subject to hazardous waste regulations. For example, if a waste is collected and returned in a closed-loop
fashion to the same process, the waste is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulated. To meet the exemption, the manner in which a material is recycled must meet the three key requirements outlined
in the rules and in 50 FR 639 (January 4, 1985): (1) The material must be returned to the original process from which it
was generated without first being reclaimed; (2) the production process to which the materials are returned must
use raw materials as principal feedstocks; and (3) the material must be returned as a substitute for raw material feedstock
in the original production process. (The regulations contain other recycling exclusions as well, but the provisions
referenced above are the principal ones most likely to be applicable to the wastes at issue in this proposal.) EPA is
proposing to amend Appendix VII and Appendix VIII to 40 CFR part 261 to add constituents contained in the above wastestreams
which were found to pose risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comments on the proposed listing of the above wastes, and on the option of not listing these wastes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action also proposes not to list as hazardous six wastestreams generated during the production of dyes and pigments:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comments on the proposal not to list the above wastes and on the option of listing these wastes.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the Agency does not have sufficient sampling information on which to base a proposed listing determination,
the Agency proposes to defer a determination of whether to list wastewater treatment sludge from the production of
triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock), as well as spent
filter aids, diatomaceous earth, or adsorbents from azo, anthraquinone, or triarylmethane dyes, pigments, or FD&amp;C
colorants. The Agency intends to obtain such sampling information and issue a supplemental notice making a proposed
determination on whether to list the wastes as hazardous. The Agency also is deferring a proposed listing determination
for wastewater treatment sludge from the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments due to lack of health effects
information on two constituents, leucoquinizarine and 1-aminoanthraquinone, that were found in the wastestream.
The Agency requests any information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that commenters may have on the toxicology of these constituents, including the existence of any toxic analogs for
leucoquinizarine and 1-aminoanthraquinone. EPA will evaluate carefully all public comments and information received
in response to this notice. Particular notice will be paid to any data which tend to support or refute a finding of risk
to human health and the environment. Based on comments received, EPA may choose, rather than deferring, to promulgate
a final determination to either list or not list wastewater treatment sludge from the production of anthraquinone
dyes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigments as hazardous under RCRA. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also requests comments on the data used in this proposal, the methodology and assumptions used in the risk
assessment, the waste groupings chosen by the Agency and other analyses supporting the proposed listings.

3. Request for Comment on the Effect of Enforceable EPA/Industry Agreements on Plausible Mismanagement Analysis
and Subsequent Listing Determinations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is interested in innovative ways of conducting listing determinations that could assure environmental
protection with less cost than full regulation as a hazardous waste. One approach on which the Agency seeks comment
involves enforceable agreements between EPA and the regulated community.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is seeking comment on whether enforceable agreements between EPA and industry that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
restrict the use of certain waste management practices could affect the Agency's plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mismanagement analysis and, in turn, affect the Agency's listing determination. Specifically, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency seeks comment on whether EPA should pursue such agreements with respect to either the dye and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigment wastes that the Agency is proposing to list in this notice (or, additionally those it 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposes not to list). The Agency seeks comment on whether the Agency should decide not to list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such wastes (or retain a no-list decision) if the agreements ensure that the wastes will not be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
managed in a manner that poses unacceptable risk. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A decision not to list based on such enforceable agreements could be based on the view that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management practices that are prohibited in an enforceable agreement are not ``plausible'' because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities within an industry covered by an enforceable agreement are unlikely to violate that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement; 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, use a risky management practice, especially if the agreement were to contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monetary or other sanctions for a breach or violation. Waste management practices that are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plausible because they are prohibited by such an agreement arguably need not be considered by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency in determining whether the waste poses ``a substantial present or potential hazard to human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, or disposed of, or otherwise 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
managed.'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
discussion of selection of waste management scenarios at I.B.1.) Thus, if a waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not pose an unacceptable risk if managed in accordance with an enforceable agreement, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency could determine that the waste should not be listed as hazardous. The Agency requests 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comment on the use of such an approach as part of the listing determination for wastes generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
during the production of dyes and pigments, including those proposed to be listed and/or proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to be listed in today's notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For such an approach to be workable, the EPA believes that the following basic principles must 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) All of the companies that generate the wastestream at issue must be party to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) To ensure that the agreement will adequately deter prohibited waste management practices, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the agreement should be enforceable in court and should contain provisions requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
payment of sufficient penalties or damages if the agreement is violated; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) The agreement should eliminate management practices that pose an unacceptable risk; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) The agreement should contain provisions that would account for new entrants; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) The agreement should promote waste minimization. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 7003 of RCRA may provide EPA with authority under appropriate circumstances to enter 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into such agreements on consent. Section 7003(a) of RCRA authorizes EPA to issue orders requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such action as may be necessary upon receipt of evidence that the past or present handling, storage, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment, transportation, or disposal of any solid waste or hazardous waste may present an imminent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment. EPA also has the authority to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
settle claims under RCRA section 7003 by entering into a consent decree or agreement. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the Agency has inherent authority to enter into contracts that are not prohibited by law. See 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Scurlock, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
347 U.S. 110 (1954). Such inherent authority also may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be available to enter into such agreements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA believes that such an approach may be feasible for the wastes generated during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of dyes and pigments because such wastes are generated by a relatively small number of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities, and the likelihood of expansion in this industry does not appear to be great. Such an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach may not be feasible in an industry with a greater number of facilities or in an industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is expanding. Additionally, it may not be a valid approach for an industrial sector in which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wastes generated are so hazardous, move off-site in such a fashion, or require such detailed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
controls that EPA wants the full regulatory controls and civil and criminal authorities that follow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from full Subtitle C regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comments on the feasibility of entering into and enforcing such agreements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with industry. The Agency also requests comment on how such agreements would account for entrance 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the market of new facilities that generate the waste at issue (

, add new elements to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreement, issue unilateral order under RCRA Section 7003). The Agency also requests comment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative innovative approaches to listing determinations.

B. Dye and Pigment Industries Overview 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The dye and pigment industries are comprised of three separate industries, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represented by three different trade associations. The Color Pigment Manufacturers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association (CPMA) represents pigment manufacturers, the Ecological and Toxicological 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Association of the Dyestuffs Manufacturing Industry (ETAD) represents dye manufacturers, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and the International Association of Color Manufacturers (IACM) represents food, drug, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cosmetic (FD&amp;C) colorants manufacturers. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dyes are intensely colored or fluorescent organic substances that impart color to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substrate by selective absorption of light.
<FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>
 When a dye is applied, it penetrates the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
substrate in a soluble form, after which it may or may not become insoluble. Dyes are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
retained in the substrate by physical absorption, salt or metal-complex formation, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solution, mechanical retention, or by the formation of ionic or covalent chemical bonds.

Dyes are used to color fabrics, leather, paper, ink, lacquers, varnishes, plastics, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cosmetics, and some food items. Dye manufacture in the U.S. includes more than 2,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual dyes, the majority of which are produced in quantities of less than 50,000 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pounds. In 1990, total U.S. dye production was 258 million pounds. In 1991, there were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 33 manufacturing plants operated by 20 companies that produce either azo, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anthraquinone, or triarylmethane dyes.

Pigments possess unique characteristics that distinguish them from dyes and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colorants. Pigments are colored, black, white, or fluorescent particulate organic or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inorganic solids, usually insoluble in, and essentially physically and chemically 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unaffected by, the vehicle or substrate in which they are incorporated. The primary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difference between pigments and dyes is that during the application process, pigments are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insoluble in the substrate. Pigments also retain a crystalline or particulate structure 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and impart color by selective absorption or by scattering of light. With dyes, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structure is temporarily altered during the application process, and imparts color only by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selective absorption.

Pigments are used in a variety of applications; the primary use is in printing inks. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are fewer pigments produced than dyes, though pigment batches are generally larger 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in size. The U.S. total 1990 pigment production volume of approximately 415 million 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pounds is composed of 300 million pounds of inorganic pigments and 115 million pounds of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic pigments.

FD&amp;C colorants are dyes and pigments that have been approved by the Food and Drug 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Administration (FDA) for use in food items, drugs, and/or cosmetics. Typically, FD&amp;C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colorants are azo or triarylmethane dyes and are similar or identical to larger-volume dye 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products not used in food, drugs, and cosmetics. Manufacture of FD&amp;C colorants is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identical to that for the corresponding dye or pigment, except that the colorant undergoes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional purification. Each FD&amp;C colorant batch is tested and certified by the FDA. In

This proposal addresses the three chemical classes of organic dyes and pigments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
specified in the settlement agreement: azos, anthraquinones, and triarylmethanes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Azos are the largest and most versatile chemical class. The various azo chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structures are readily synthesized, typical product application methods are not complex, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and a broad range of colors can be produced with excellent fastness properties. Azo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colorants are used in essentially all organic dye applications, including textiles, paper, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inks, coatings, plastics, and leather. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pyrazolones are a subset of azo dyes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigments, named for the substituted pyrazolones that are used as coupling agents. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pyrazolone subclass is comprised mainly of yellow, orange, and red azo dyes and pigments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pyrazolone dyes and pigments are used primarily in textiles and plastics, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite high costs, anthraquinones are an important group of dyes due to superior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fastness. They have applications on cotton, cellulose, and synthetic fibers. They have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
good affinity for the substrate, level dyeing power, and excellent fastness. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Anthraquinone pigments are chemically identical to the corresponding dyestuffs and also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exhibit high fastness properties. They are used primarily in automotive paints. There 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are many more anthraquinone dyes than pigments. Most anthraquinone dyes have not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
developed into pigments due to technical constraints, as well as competition from less 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expensive substitutes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Perylene pigments, a subset of the anthraquinone chemical class, provide an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economical alternative to heavy metal-containing red pigments. Their excellent thermal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
stability and fastness properties meet the standards for automotive finishes and other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high-quality coatings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Triarylmethanes are characterized by their brilliancy of hue, intensity of color, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
low fastness properties. Triarylmethane dyes typically are used in the textile industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in the production of pigments. Pigments typically are used in the production of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
printing and duplicating inks.

C. Description of the Process Wastes Identified in Comparison to Those Specified in the Settlement Agreement
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the Agency's study of the dye and pigment industries, EPA has concluded that many of the dye and pigment processes
within each of the three chemical classes generate very similar wastestreams. Because of the similarity of wastestreams
associated with the manufacture of each class of dye or pigment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 azo, anthraquinone, and triarylmethane), EPA combined closely related wastestreams into ``waste groupings,''
and proposed one hazardous waste listing description and waste code for each of these groupings. Although, given
time and resource constraints, EPA was not able to sample wastestreams generated from the production of each distinct
product within a particular waste grouping, the sampling data and raw material and process chemistry information
that EPA collected support the waste groupings EPA has established.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The constituents and their concentrations in a waste will determine, in turn, the nature of the toxicity of the waste.
EPA is required to consider the nature and toxicity of a waste in making listing determinations pursuant to 40 CFR 261.11.
Given that similarities between wastes will result in a similar listing determination pursuant to the factors in
EPA's regulations, it is reasonable to group wastes for the purpose of making listing determinations. Further, grouping
similar waste matrices (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 wastewaters or sludges) will facilitate the development of land disposal treatment standards (see 40 CFR part 268).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Listing determinations were made on each waste grouping. For example, all wastewaters resulting from the production
of azo pigments are proposed to be listed as K163 hazardous wastes. Other wastewater groupings for which listing determinations
were made include wastewaters resulting from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&amp;C colorants (proposed
as K165), wastewaters resulting from the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments, and wastewaters resulting
from the production of FD&amp;C colorants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, wastewaters generated from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments are grouped together
under one waste grouping due to the similarity of these wastes, with the exception of wastewaters from the production
of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane pigments
using aniline as a feedstock were found to be significantly different in chemical composition from other triarylmethane
dye and pigment processes and, therefore, were placed in a separate waste grouping.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock are manufactured at two facilities in the country. Only two
triarylmethane products are made at each of these facilities and one is used as an intermediate for the second. The
process used in manufacturing these pigments is a batch process but is operated throughout the year. Only two primary
reactants are used at these facilities, unlike other dye and pigment operations where hundreds of raw materials often
are used at one site. As a result, these reactants are present in the wastewater at high concentrations.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Thus, wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments were divided into two categories for purposes
of making a listing determination: (1) Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments, excluding
triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock, and (2) wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane
pigments using aniline as a feedstock.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The wastewater categories include mother liquors generated from product filtration, filter washwaters, equipment
and floor cleaning washwaters, break waters, spent scrubber waters, and other process waters. Treated wastewater
effluent also is captured by these wastewater groupings. Although EPA did not sample wastewater following treatment,
treated wastewater would be expected to contain the same or fewer hazardous constituents and the same or lower concentrations
of such constituents than untreated wastewater. Thus, if not listed before treatment, such wastewater is presumed
not to meet the Agency's criteria for listing after treatment. Furthermore, any wastewater listed as hazardous before
treatment would continue to be regulated as hazardous waste after treatment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wastewater treatment sludges were grouped in a similar manner to wastewaters. Wastewater treatment sludges generated
from the dye and pigment industries include any sludges generated during the pretreatment or treatment of dye and
pigment wastewaters. This includes pretreatment sludge generated from filtration and precipitation in equalization
and neutralization basins, sludges from powdered activated carbon or other adsorbent treatments, and primary and
secondary biological treatment sludges. Sludge groupings defined for purposes of listing determinations include
wastewater treatment sludge from the production of azo pigments (proposed as K162), wastewater treatment sludge
from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&amp;C colorants (proposed as K164), wastewater treatment sludge from
the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments, wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane
dyes and pigments, excluding triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock, and wastewater treatment sludge
from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. These groupings are justified because,
as was true within the wastewater grouping, the sludges covered by each sludge waste group exhibit similarities in
constituent concentrations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Distillation bottoms from dye and pigment manufacturing are generated during raw material and solvent recovery
operations. The Agency determined that still bottoms from dye and pigment manufacturing are generated only during
recovery operations associated with the manufacture of triarylmethane dyes and pigments. Therefore, the following
waste grouping was developed to address distillation bottoms from the dye and pigment industries: Still bottoms
or heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes or pigments (proposed as K166).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency grouped spent filter aids, diatomaceous earth, or adsorbents used in the production of azo, anthraquinone,
or triarylmethane dyes, pigments, or FD&amp;C colorants into one waste grouping because these wastes all adsorb
unreacted raw materials, by-products, and impurities and are generated in physically similar forms. Because the
constituent composition of these filter aids varies depending on raw materials used, the Agency does not, at this
time, have sufficient data to fully characterize this waste grouping. To further support a listing determination
on these wastestreams, the Agency intends to collect additional information which will allow assessment of these
wastes either as a single waste grouping or, alternatively, as several separate groupings.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dusts and dust collector fines are generated primarily during drying, grinding, and blending operations used in
manufacturing both dyes and pigments. These wastestreams were grouped because they all are comprised primarily
of product dust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Product standardization filter cake probably is generated during a final purification step following product standardization.
Information obtained during the industry study does not confirm the existence or description of this wastestream.
However, filter cakes generated during product purification are comprised of spent filter aids, diatomaceous earth,
or other adsorbent, along with product impurities and, therefore, will be characterized with the spent filter aids
wastestream described above.

D. Description of Health and Risk Assessments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
In determining whether waste generated from the production of dyes and pigments meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criteria for listing a waste as hazardous as set out at 40 CFR 261.11, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
evaluated the potential toxicity and intrinsic hazard of constituents present in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestreams, the fate and mobility of these chemicals, the likely exposure routes, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current waste management practices, and plausible management practices. A quantitative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk assessment was conducted for those constituents and wastestreams where the available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information made such an assessment possible. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 -->
1. Human Health Criteria and Effects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The Agency uses health-based levels, or HBLs, as a means for evaluating the level of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern of toxic constituents in various media. In the development of HBLs, EPA first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must determine exposure levels that are protective of human health and then apply standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure assumptions to develop media-specific levels. EPA uses the following hierarchy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for evaluating health effects data and health-based standards in establishing chemical-specific HBLS: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a. Use the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) or proposed MCL (PMCL) as the HBL for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ingestion of the constituent in water, when it exists. MCLs are promulgated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SWDA) of 1974, as amended in 1986, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consider technology and economic feasibility as well as health effects. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
b. Use Agency-verified Reference Doses (RfDs) or Reference Concentrations (RfCs) in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculating HBLs for noncarcinogens and verified carcinogenic slope factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(CSFs) in calculating HBLs for carcinogens. Agency-verified RfDs, RfCs, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
CSFs and the bases for these values are presented in the EPA's Integrated Risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information System (IRIS).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
c. Use RfDs, RfCs, or CSFs that are calculated by standard methods but not verified by the Agency. These values can be
found in a number of different types of Agency documents and EPA uses the following hierarchy when reviewing these
documents: Health Effects Assessment Summary Tables (HEAST); Human Health Assessment Group for Carcinogens; Health
Assessment Summaries (HEAs) and Health and Environmental Effects Profiles (HEEPs); and Health and Environmental
Effects Documents (HEEDs). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
d. Use RfDs or CSFs that are calculated by alternative methods, such as surrogate analysis, including structure activity
analysis, and toxicity equivalency. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
All HBLs and their bases for this listing determination are provided in a document entitled ``Dye and Pigment Waste
Listing Support Health Effects Background Document'' (RTI,1994), which can be found in the RCRA docket for this rule
at EPA Headquarters (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acute toxicity data such as lethal doses for the oral and dermal routes and lethal concentrations for the inhalation
route also were evaluated for all analytes in the record samples. These data also are presented in the Health Effects
Background Document prepared for this rule.

Use of Metabolic Products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There are three compounds commonly identified in the record samples for which EPA has found no reliable health effects
data. These compounds are: Acetoacet-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
o
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-anisidide (AAOA), acetoacet-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
o
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidide (AAOT), and acetoacetanilide (AAA). Because of the lack of health effects data on these compounds, the
Agency explored the use of metabolic pathway information to develop toxicologic values. This approach involves
the use of health effects information for compounds expected to follow a similar metabolic pathway to those of the
three chemicals of concern to estimate toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The metabolic pathways for the class of compounds identified as aromatic amines have been extensively studied, and
acetylation and N-hydroxylation have been identified as initial metabolic reactions of this class of compounds.
Using this information, the Agency proposes to use the toxicity of aniline to represent the toxicity of AAA and the
toxicity of 2-aminotoluene to represent the toxicity of AAOA and AAOT. The Agency has assumed a direct quantitative
relationship between the constituents of concern (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, AAOA, AAOT, AAA) and these compounds (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, aniline, 2-aminotoluene) that follow a similar metabolic route. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In humans as much as 60 percent of aniline that is absorbed is oxidized in a dose-dependent manner to give

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
p
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-aminophenol, the first step in amide formation for this pathway. The metabolites of these products include acetylated
arylamines, and are responsible for the toxicity of aniline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acetoacetanilide (AAA) is a structural analog of aniline and the metabolic pathways are expected to be similar. Since
the acetyl group is already part of AAA, initial acetylation may be considered complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the metabolic conversions occur on a molar basis and the doses in laboratory studies are reported as parts
per million, the difference in molecular weight must be considered. Also, since only 60 percent of the aniline is expected
to be metabolized by the acetylation pathway and AAA is acetylated in its original form, the toxicity of AAA is expected
to be proportionally greater than the toxicity of aniline. Therefore, the HBL for AAA is estimated to be 0.003 mg/L
as compared to 0.006 mg/L for aniline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Acetoacet-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-anisidide (AAOA) are structural analogues of 2-aminotoluene, and the metabolic pathways are expected to be similar
to those previously described for aniline. Since the acetyl group is already part of AAOT and AAOA, initial acetylation
may be considered complete. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the metabolic conversions occur on a molar basis and the doses in laboratory studies are reported as parts
per million, the difference in molecular weight must be considered. Also, since only 25 percent of the aminotoluene
is expected to be metabolized by the acetylation pathway, and AAOT and AAOA are acetylated in their original forms,
their toxicities are expected to be proportionally greater than the toxicity of 2-aminotoluene. Therefore, the
HBLs for AAOT and AAOA are estimated to be 0.00004 mg/L and 0.00005 mg/L, respectively, as compared to 0.0001 mg/L for
2-aminotoluene. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2-Methoxyaniline also has been identified in the azo pigment wastestream. 2-Aminotoluene has been selected as the
surrogate for the toxicity of 2-methoxyaniline, because of the structural similarity of the compounds and the similarity
of metabolic mechanisms described above. The Agency requests comment on the use of metabolic pathway information
to determine health effects, and on alternate approaches.

2. Coeluting Compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A number of compounds detected in the wastes generated from dye and pigment manufacture coelute (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
overlap) on the Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) curve, making it impossible to confirm the concentration
and, in some cases, the presence of the individual coeluting compounds. For example, the three constituents, 2- and
4-aminoaniline, and 2-methoxyaniline, coelute on the GC/MS curve. The coelution is such that the presence of 2- and
4-aminoaniline is indistinguishable, yet the presence of 2- methoxyaniline can be verified. This occurs because
the curve for 2-methoxyaniline contains an extra peak in addition to the peaks that overlap with 2- and 4-aminoaniline.
However, the individual contributions to the total concentration found in the waste can not be established. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the contributions from the individual contaminants can not be established, the Agency assumed that any of
the three contaminants could be present at 100 percent of the concentration detected. The Agency evaluated all coeluting
compounds independently in the risk assessment and used the highest risk calculated for the compounds to ensure the
risk was not underestimated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, 2-methoxyaniline is the expected contaminant in wastes generated from facilities that manufacture azo
pigments using acetoacet-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
o
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-anisidide (AAOA) as a raw material because 2-methoxyaniline is an expected hydrolysis product of AAOA (refer to
Section II.E, Wastewater Treatment Sludge from the Production of Azo Pigments, K162, for a discussion on the hydrolysis
of AAOA). Therefore, for wastes generated from the manufacture of azo pigments using AAOA as a raw material, the Agency
conducted the risk assessment for these coeluting compounds based on toxicity information for 2-methoxyaniline
(see discussion of metabolic products, above, and the Dye and Pigment Waste Listing Support Health Effects Background
Document for discussions on the toxicity surrogate used for 2-methoxyaniline).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A second set of coeluting compounds consists of the three isomers 2-, 3-, and 4-aminotoluene. The presence of the three
isomers was confirmed when detected, and the combined concentration of the three compounds was quantified. Because
the contributions from the individual contaminants can not be established, any one of the coeluting contaminants
could be present at 100 percent of the concentration detected. Therefore, the Agency evaluated coeluting compounds
with health-based levels independently in the risk assessment and used the highest risk calculated by the constituents,
in this case 2-aminotoluene, to ensure that risk was not underestimated. The volume of 2-aminotoluene consumed as
a raw material, based on 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data, is approximately 9 times that of the other isomers.
In addition, aromatic amines with substitutions in the 2- and 4- positions of the aromatic ring are used in the manufacture
of azo dyes much more frequently than those substituted in the 3- position. Therefore, any impurities or breakdown
products from aromatic amines are likely to be substituted in the 2- and 4- positions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1,2-diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene also coelute on the GC/MS curve. Both compounds are likely oxidation products
of aniline, and may be present in the waste as reaction by-products. In addition to the uncertainty in establishing
concentrations for each of the two compounds, the chemical pathway from aniline to these oxidation products suggests
that either contaminant may be present at all or part of the concentration detected. The Agency evaluated these coeluting
compounds independently and used the highest risk calculated by the compounds to ensure the risk was not underestimated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As with azobenzene and 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, diphenylamine and N-nitrosodiphenylamine coelute on the GC/MS
curve and are likely by-products resulting from the oxidation of aniline. As stated above, the Agency evaluated these
coeluting compounds independently and used the highest risk calculated by the compounds to ensure the risk was not
underestimated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comments on the approach used to assess risk when compounds that coelute were detected in the wastestream,
and on alternative approaches that commenters may develop.

3. Risk Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Risk Characterization Approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The risk characterization approach follows the recent EPA Guidance on Risk Characterization (Habicht, 1992) and
Guidance for Risk Assessment (EPA Risk Assessment Council, 1991). The guidance specifies that EPA risk assessments
will be expected to include (1) the central tendency and high-end portions of the risk distribution, and (2) important
subgroups of the populations such as highly susceptible groups or individuals, if known. In addition to the presentation
of results, the guidance also specifies that the results portray a reasonable picture of the actual or projected exposures
with a discussion of uncertainties. These documents are available in the public docket for this action (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

Individual Risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Individual risk descriptors are intended to convey information about the risk borne by individuals within a specified
population and subpopulations. These risk descriptors are used to answer questions concerning the affected population,
and the risk for individuals within a population of interest. The approach used in this analysis for characterizing
baseline individual risk included: (1) Identifying and describing the population of concern for an exposure route;
(2) determining the sensitivity of the model parameters used in the risk estimation; (3) estimating central tendency
and high-end values for the most sensitive parameters in the risk estimation procedures; and (4) calculating individual
risk for likely exposure pathways that provides a characterization of the central tendency and high-end risk descriptor.

Risk Assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The results of the risk assessment are presented in waste-specific risk tables in each of the basis for listing sections
(Section II.E.). The risk tables include the following information: Constituents of concern; estimated human health
risk associated with the current and plausible management scenarios; high, low, and average concentrations of constituents
found in this wastestream; the number of samples in which the constituent was detected; notes regarding ``J-values''
(see Section II.B on Data Uncertainties); and industry-submitted data. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to those compounds presented in the waste-specific risk tables, the Agency's characterization data
include a number of compounds identified as present in the waste but for which no health benchmarks exist. In addition,
other compounds which do have health benchmarks have been identified in these wastes but were dropped from further
consideration following the risk screening because the risks were projected to be below levels of concern. The risk
tables presented in this preamble do not contain these additional constituents. The complete list of constituents
found in each of the wastes generated from the manufacture of dyes and pigments, an explanation of the risk screening
process, and an explanation of EPA's development of the target analyte list are presented in the Listing and Health
Effects Background Documents for this proposed rule, which are located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (See

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The analysis of risk was developed using both the input of derived or measured toxicological information and the modeling
of exposure from baseline (or current) waste management practices and other plausible management scenarios. Pursuant
to the Agency's regulations on listing hazardous wastes, EPA considers the ``plausible types of improper management
to which the waste could be subjected'', 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3)(vii). Thus, plausible management is one of the waste
management scenarios used by EPA to assess the risks to human health and the environment from the disposal of the wastes
under consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The choice of ``plausible management'' depends on a combination of factors which are discussed in Section II.A, ``EPA's
Listing Determination Process.'' The following discussion explains the plausible management scenarios used to
assess risk for each of the waste groups addressed in this proposal. The Agency requests comment on its choice of plausible
management scenarios and on the possibility of using alternative plausible management scenarios.

sludges from the production of azo dyes and pigments (K162 and K164), and still bottoms or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (K166) was disposal in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an on-site monofill. Disposal in an on-site monofill for these waste categories results 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the highest adverse exposure of sensitive individuals or populations. For wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment sludges from azo dye production (K164), this plausible management scenario 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, on-site monofill) currently is practiced. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency determined that disposal in an on-site monofill is a plausible management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario for wastewater treatment sludges from azo pigment production (K162) and still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottoms or heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (K166), for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following reasons: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;On-site monofills have been used by industry to dispose of wastewater treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludge from the manufacture of dyes and pigments; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Most of the still bottoms generated from the production of triarylmethane dyes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and pigments are high-volume wastestreams for which on-site monofills are a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plausible management option; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;On-site monofills can be a lower-cost disposal option. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, there is a potential for monofills to be constructed and used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future, by either dye or pigment manufacturers to dispose of wastewater treatment sludges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or other high-volume solid wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane pigments using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aniline as a feedstock, the plausible management was determined to be the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management, blending with non-hazardous fuel. Currently, 100% of this waste is sent off-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
site for non-hazardous fuel blending. The Agency believes that this waste will continue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be managed in this manner because the relatively high organic content of the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
gives the material value as a fuel ingredient. Therefore, generators of the waste have an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic incentive to continue fuel blending. For comparison purposes, the Agency also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
projected the risks from managing this wastestream in a municipal landfill (from release 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of contaminants into ground water) and in an on-site boiler (from release of contaminants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the air). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary exposure pathway considered from disposal of solid materials in both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unlined municipal landfills (evaluated as the baseline management practice for K162, K164, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and K166) and monofills (evaluated as plausible management practices for K162, K164, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
K166) is direct ingestion of drinking water from residential wells near the disposal site. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because of the widespread practice of daily cover, indirect air pathways and surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
erosion and runoff were not evaluated for municipal landfills. For on-site monofills, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, the presumption of no daily cover was used, and risks associated with indirect 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathways were evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to estimating potential risks from waste disposed in an unlined municipal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landfill, the Agency evaluated risks from municipal landfills meeting the minimum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements for a Subtitle D landfill (56 FR 50978, 1991). These requirements include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
daily cover, flexible membrane liner, leachate collection system, clay liner, and final 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cap and cover. The results of these analyses can be found in the Risk Assessment for Dye 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Pigment Waste Listing Determination. This document is available in the RCRA public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
docket (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A dilution factor based on the ratio of the volume of the waste to the volume of co-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposed municipal waste and daily cover was used to estimate the concentrations of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents of concern in the landfill. The concentrations of the constituents measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the waste were multiplied by this dilution factor to determine the concentration of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents in the landfill. The concentrations of the constituents in the landfill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leachate were estimated using Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP) data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
submitted by industry for selected constituents (3,3
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;-dichlorobenzidine, aniline, 4- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chloroaniline, and 2- and 4-aminotoluene), or when TCLP data were not available, by using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a soil-water partitioning equation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA used the following linear partition equation (Dragan, 1988) with an adjustment to

The volume of leachate and rate of ground-water recharge were estimated using the

HELP model. The HELP model uses site-specific precipitation values and standard 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumptions for the characteristics of municipal waste to estimate infiltration and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recharge rates. For the evaluation of dye and pigment wastes in municipal landfills, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
annual precipitation rates for sites near all dye and pigment facilities were ranked. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Charlotte, North Carolina was selected as representative of the median precipitation value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the areas near dye and pigment facilities, and Charleston, South Carolina, was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
selected as representative of sites with high annual rainfall potential. The default 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meteorologic conditions for these locations in the HELP model were used to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
infiltration and recharge rates used in the ground-water modeling.

The distance to the receptor wells near the municipal landfill used in the ground-water modeling were obtained from
the survey of well distances conducted for the Background Document for EPACML: Finite Source Methodology (EPA, 1992).
The value selected as representative of the average condition is the 50th-percentile value for well distance (438
m), and the value for the high-end (close) condition (48 m) is the 95th-percentile value. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency used the MULTIMED groundwater model to simulate the subsurface dilution and attenuation of the leachate
constituents in order to estimate the concentration of constituents at the hypothetical residential wells. The
Agency then calculated risks to an individual, assuming the residents using this well on average consume 1.4 L/day
of contaminated water, or 2 L/day for higher consumptions. Values of 9 or 30 years were used for the average and high-exposure
duration estimates. The formulae used and a more detailed discussion of the application of these models to the waste
samples can be found in the Risk Assessment for Dye and Pigment Waste Listing Determination, available in the RCRA
public docket (see

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For on-site monofills, the leaching analysis was the same as for municipal landfills except that the waste concentrations
are not diluted in the monofill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The distance to the nearest receptor wells near the on-site landfill used in the ground-water modeling were obtained
from a telephone survey of 9 city planning offices and a review of site visit reports and site maps. The value selected
as representative of the average condition is the 50th-percentile value for well distance (163 m) and the value for
the high-end (close) condition (16 m) is the closest value. The Risk Assessment for Dye and Pigment Waste Listing Determination
for this rulemaking contains a more detailed discussion of these values. This document is available in the RCRA public

In addition to direct ingestion of contaminated drinking water, additional pathways were evaluated depending on
the characteristics of the waste and management practices evaluated. These pathways included inhalation pathways
from airborne particulates and volatiles released from the monofills, and indirect exposure pathways such as the
ingestion of vegetables grown in soil contaminated by runoff from the on-site landfill and/or dermal exposure due
to direct contact with contaminated soil. The algorithms used for the estimation of risks due to indirect exposures
were taken from the Methodology for Assessing Health Risks Associated with Indirect Exposure to Combustion Emissions
(U.S. EPA, 1990) as modified by the September 24 draft of Addendum: Methodology for Assessing Health Risks Associated
with Indirect Exposure to Combustion Emissions. Working Group Recommendations (U.S. EPA, 1993) and the Risk Assessment
Guidance for Superfund (RAGS): Volume I_Human Health Evaluation Manual (Part B, Development of Risk-base Preliminary
Remediation Goals) (U.S. EPA, 1991), and Dermal Exposure Assessment: Principles and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The air pathways were evaluated using the CHEMDAT 7 air emission model to determine the emission rates for volatile
constituents from the landfill, tanks, and storage bins. The Fugitive Dust Model (FDM) was used to determine the emission
rates for particulates. These emissions were coupled with dispersion coefficients to determine the ambient air
concentrations and the rate of deposition of the waste constituents onto the nearby soil, vegetable gardens, watersheds,
and water bodies. The distances to air receptors are assumed to be similar to those used for the ground-water wells.
The meteorologic locations used for the air modeling were selected by a procedure similar to that used to select the
ground-water locations. The annual average wind speed, temperature, and precipitation values for 34 sites near
dye and pigment facilities were evaluated to determine three sites believed to represent a range of conditions to
be examined in greater detail. Hourly meteorological data for five years were ranked for these three sites to select
the location and year of the data to be used in the air modeling. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average case, Huntington, West Virginia was selected. For the high-end case, Charlotte, North Carolina was selected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An on-site boiler (as the plausible management scenario) also was evaluated for exposure through the air pathway
for still bottoms generated from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (K166), and for wastewater treatment
sludge from the production of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock. The boiler was characterized
as a small non-hazardous boiler based upon Agency information and industry-supplied data in the RCRA Section 3007
Questionnaire data. The meteorologic data used to characterize the dispersion were determined based upon a distribution
of meteorologic data collected for sites near existing dye facilities. These data are ranked by year and location,
and the 50th- and 90th-percentile year and location were selected for the central and high-end dispersion modeling.
The air dispersion was estimated using the COMPDEP model to estimate air concentrations and wet and dry deposition
of the constituents on nearby soil, vegetables and water bodies. The air concentrations and deposition data also
were used to evaluate indirect exposures.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For wastewater streams (K163, K165, and wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments) the
Agency determined that treatment in surface impoundments represents the plausible management scenario because,
since surface impoundments currently are in use or planned at several dye facilities, and waste management practices
in the dye and pigment industries are generally similar, the Agency believes that pigment manufacturers may employ
surface impoundments in the future. In addition, facilities currently manufacturing dyes also could manufacture
pigments in the future and manage wastewaters from pigment production in surface impoundments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The baseline management practice evaluated for these wastewater streams (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., K163, K165, and wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments) was treatment in tanks. Thus,
for wastewaters, the modeling included direct and indirect exposures to volatile emissions from surface impoundments
and tanks and direct and indirect exposures to contaminants that may leach into ground water from unlined surface
impoundments. The air emissions from tanks were estimated using the CHEMDAT 7 air emission model and the dispersion
of these emissions was estimated using the Industrial Source Complex Model-Long Term, Version 2 (ISCLT2) air dispersion
model. The meteorologic locations used for estimating the emissions and dispersions were the same locations selected
for use with air models for volatile emissions from landfills. Very few inhalation health-based levels are available
for constituents found in dye and pigment wastewaters. Risk from direct inhalation exposure to wastes disposed in
surface impoundments was estimated to be less than one-in-a-million for all constituents. Results from air emission
modeling for tanks are presented in the Risk Assessment Background Document for the Proposed Rule in the RCRA Docket
at EPA Headquarters (see

 section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since the constituents in these wastes are highly soluble, leaching from unlined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundments was evaluated. The concentration of the constituents in the leachate was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumed to be equal to the concentration in the wastewater.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
To estimate the concentration of constituents at the hypothetical residential well, the Agency attempted to use
the MULTIMED model to simulate the subsurface attenuation and dilution of the surface impoundment leachate. However,
there are limitations of the MULTIMED model that preclude its use in this analysis. These include the large volume
of leachate estimated to be released from the surface impoundment and a conservative approach to predict the horizontal
transport of the leachate within the aquifer. This resulted in an infiltration rate that is so high that it overwhelms
the aquifer and dilution was not expected. Therefore, to evaluate risk for those wastewaters that the Agency is proposing
to list, the Agency assumed for this proposal that a dilution and attenuation factor (DAF) of 100 is achievable during
migration to the nearest drinking water well. The Agency's toxicity characteristic (TC) rule (55 FR 11798, 1990)
adopts a DAF of 100 to estimate the subsurface fate and transport between an unlined landfill and a receptor drinking
water well. For purposes of the risk analyses, the concentrations in the residential wells near the on-site disposal
facility were estimated to be equal to 0.01 times the concentrations measured in the wastewater. The residents using
this well are assumed on average to consume 1.4 L/day or 2L/day of contaminated water for an exposure duration of 9 years
or 30 years. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that it is more reasonable to use the TC rule approach to support a proposed determination to list,
rather than developing a model more sophisticated than the MULTIMED model because the Agency believes a more sophisticated
analysis would suggest greater estimated risks than the analysis using a DAF of 100 for the following reasons. First,
the DAF of 100 was derived for the TC rule for a range of municipal landfill leachate volumes that are generally lower
than leachate volumes from surface impoundments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Surface impoundment DAFs are expected to be lower (and risks subsequently higher) compared to landfill DAFs as a result
of both the liquid in the impoundment and subsequent increase in hydraulic head. Second, in the TC analysis, the location
of the receptor well was varied anywhere within the extent of the contaminant plume. For listing determinations,
the Agency generally assumes that the well is located on the centerline of the plume. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This assumption would lead to a lower DAF and higher risks. Thus, because the use of the TC DAF of 100 underestimates
risk, use of the TC to estimate risk can support a proposal to list. A more sophisticated model would show only higher
risk numbers. The wastewaters that the Agency proposes not to list were evaluated using MULTIMED and creating a bounding
estimate. The Agency believes that it is reasonable to use the MULTIMED model to support this proposed determination
not to list certain wastewaters because it overestimates risks.

In addition to evaluating the risk to human health, the analysis also estimates risks to fish and wildlife from exposure
to dye and pigment wastes. The concentrations of contaminants of concern in water bodies near dye and pigment waste
facilities were estimated using the indirect exposure methodology and a few high-end input parameters. As a screening
analysis, the estimated surface-water concentrations were compared with the National Ambient Water Quality Criteria
(NAWQC), or LC

evaluated by comparing the waste concentration with the oral rat LD

Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to list as hazardous wastewater treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludges from the production of azo pigments. This wastestream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meets the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste as hazardous and is capable of posing a substantial present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or potential hazard to human health or the environment. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion of contaminated ground water, EPA calculated high-end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual cancer-risk levels for six hazardous constituents that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are equal to or exceed 1E&hyph;4 for carcinogens or have HQs equal to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or greater than 1 for non-carcinogens for the plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management practice, an on-site monofill. The combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogenic risk for multiple co-existing constituents in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream is projected to be 6E&hyph;3 for the on-site monofill. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, a combined risk of 1E&hyph;4 for multiple co-existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminants were identified for the baseline management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice, a municipal landfill. Calculated risks exceeding 1E&hyph;4 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also were identified from exposure to four contaminants through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion of contaminated vegetables or through dermal contact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The volume reported by the industry in the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data for wastewater treatment sludge
from the manufacture of azo pigments (K162) is not included at the present time due to business confidentiality concerns.
Over 99% of this wastestream currently is disposed in Subtitle D municipal landfills. Therefore, the Agency used
disposal in a municipal landfill as the baseline management practice. In addition, as explained under Section II.D,
Description of Health and Risk Assessments, the Agency evaluated on-site monofilling as a plausible management
scenario.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The projected risks of increased cancer or hazard quotient above one for exposure to this waste are presented in Table
II&hyph;2. The data presented in this table represent 16 samples collected from 4 azo pigment-manufacturing facilities.
Eleven of the 16 samples were collected and analyzed by industry, and were submitted to EPA for evaluation. The 11 industry
samples were analyzed using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), Method 8270B in EPA's ``Test Methods
for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods'' (SW&hyph;846, Third Edition) but were not analyzed using
High Pressure Liquid Chromatography/Thermospray/Mass Spectrometry (HPLC/TS/MS), Method 8321 in SW&hyph;846.
EPA has reviewed the quality of these industry submitted data and has found that these data meet the Agency's data quality
objectives and, therefore, qualify for inclusion in the waste assessment. Inclusion of these industry data, however,
does bias the industry's characterization toward one facility (

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, of 16 data points, 11 were submitted by one facility, and 2 were collected by the Agency at that same facility). The
five EPA-collected samples, representing four facilities, were analyzed using both methods, a process which encompasses
more analytes. Therefore, several analytes, specifically acetoacetanilide (AAA), acetoacet-

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculated risks from ingesting contaminated ground water associated with disposing these sludges in on-site
monofills are very high. Three of the compounds that exceed risk levels of 1E&hyph;4 are common raw materials used
as coupling agents in the manufacture of azo pigments: acetoacetanilide (AAA), acetoacet-

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidide (AAOT). These three compounds were expected to be present in the waste, and consistently were found in
the samples collected by the Agency.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The three coupling compounds present in this waste, AAA, AAOA, and AAOT, are predicted to pose very high risks via ground-water
ingestion when managed in an on-site monofill. As shown in Table II&hyph;2, the calculated risks posed by these compounds
range from 1E&hyph;3 to 6E&hyph;4. These risks were calculated using metabolic product structural-activity relationships
(SAR) for these compounds. A detailed discussion of the SAR for these compounds, and the estimation of toxicities
for AAA, AAOA, and AAOT is presented earlier in this preamble, under Section II.C, Description of Health and Risk Assessments,
and in the Health Assessment Background Document for this proposed rule, which is located in the RCRA Docket for this
rulemaking (See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
addresses
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These three compounds are high-volume couplers used in the manufacture of azo pigments. Based on RCRA Section 3007
Questionnaire data, AAA is the third highest-volume reactant in the pigment industry, with over 8200 metric tons
used in 1991. AAOT and AAOA also are used in high volumes; their 1991 use volumes were 2600 and 850 Mtons, respectively.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAA, AAOT, and AAOA were found in 85% of the wastewater systems where they are used. When detected in the wastewater
system, the compound was found either in the wastewater or in the sludge. Table II&hyph;4 presents the number of wastewater
systems where each of the three coupling compounds were detected. Table II&hyph;4 also shows the number of samples
in which the three coupling compounds were detected relative to the number in which the compounds were expected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acids and amine salts under acidic conditions. Measurements of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pH values of process wastewaters at several pigment production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities revealed that these acidic conditions are encountered 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
frequently. The hydrolysis products for AAA, AAOT, and AAOA are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline, respectively. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unreacted amide raw materials and the amines expected from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydrolysis of these amides both have been identified in untreated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters and wastewater biological treatment sludges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Two sets of coeluting compounds were observed from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis of wastewater treatment sludge from the production of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
azo pigments. The first set of coeluting compounds produced one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data point, shown in Table E1, for which the mass spectrum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicates the presence of 2-methoxyaniline, along with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential presence of 2- and 4-aminoaniline (for a discussion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coeluting compounds and risk assessments conducted on these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds, please refer to the section entitled ``Coeluting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compounds'' in Section II.D). 2-Methoxyaniline is expected as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminant in the wastewater treatment sludge from the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that generated the sample because that facility manufactures azo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigments using acetoacet-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
o
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-anisidide (AAOA) as a raw material, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and, as stated above, 2-methoxyaniline is an expected hydrolysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product of AAOA. In addition, the facility from which this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sample was collected uses 2-aminoaniline as a reactant in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture of azo dyes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For this wastestream, the Agency conducted the risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment for these coeluting compounds based on toxicity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information for 2-methoxyaniline because this contaminant is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected to be present from azo pigment production. Since there 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently is no HBL for 2-methoxyaniline, the Agency based the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk assessment on the toxicity of a surrogate compound. 2-Aminotoluene is a structural analog of 2-methoxyaniline
and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
being used as a toxicity surrogate. The resulting high-end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual cancer-risk level for 2-methoxyaniline was calculated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be 2E&hyph;3 for the on-site monofill management scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second set of coeluting compounds consists of the two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isomers 2- and 4-aminotoluene. The two isomers were detected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3 out of 8 sludge samples from azo pigment manufacturing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations, and the combined concentration of the two compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was quantified. The calculated high-end individual cancer-risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
level, based on the toxicity of 2-aminotoluene, is 3E&hyph;5 for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on-site monofill management scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the substantial calculated risks (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding 1E&hyph;4 for carcinogens) posed by raw materials used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
azo pigment manufacturing and their break-down products, four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional contaminants were found in the wastestream at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations that are projected to pose very high risks (HQs of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1 or greater for non-carcinogens) through ingestion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated ground water under plausible management in an on-site monofill. 1,3-Dinitrobenzene, nitrobenzene,
and 2,4-dinitrophenol were found at concentrations that resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated high-end HQs of 7, 9, and 1 respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to assessing the risks associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the combined risk of constituents that co-exist in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream. In the case of wastewater treatment sludges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated from the manufacture of azo pigments, all of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diazotization and coupling reactants and breakdown products 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
previously discussed in this section (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., AAA, AAOT, AAOA, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline) are assumed to co-exist in the wastestream. The reactants are used
in numerous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large-volume pigments which are manufactured on a frequent basis. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since this sludge is a commingled wastestream representing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production from the entire plant, the constituents are likely to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be present simultaneously in the waste. Therefore, the combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk of these individual constituents, which is projected to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very high (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 8E&hyph;3 at the high end), also was considered in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making this listing determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the very high risks posed by the plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management practice (a monofill), the calculated risks posed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current management practice (a municipal landfill) are also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high. The combined additive high-end risk for the reactants and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
breakdown products previously discussed in this section (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
AAA, AAOT, AAOA, aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is projected to be 1E&hyph;4 for the municipal landfill management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice. Therefore, EPA concludes that even if the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered current management and did not consider plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management, this wastestream would present a substantial risk to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human health and the environment, and should be listed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three additional constituents (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

., aniline, 3,3
<!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong -->
&rsquo;-dimethylbenzidine, and 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
2-aminotoluene) were found in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater treatment sludge from azo pigment operations at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations that are projected to pose risks within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency's risk range of concern (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., 1E&hyph;4 to 1E&hyph;6 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogens) using the on-site monofill management scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Four constituents (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., AAOA, AAOT, AAA, and the coeluting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds 2-aminoaniline and 2-methoxyaniline) were found in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste at concentrations that pose risks between 1E&hyph;4 and 1E&hyph;6 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogens for the municipal landfill scenario. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
six constituents pose risks within this range of potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concern through indirect pathways. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on an analysis of the risks associated with both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current and plausible management practices, EPA is proposing to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list wastewater treatment sludge from the production of azo 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigments as a hazardous waste, designated as EPA Hazardous Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Number K162. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing to list wastewaters from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of azo pigments as hazardous wastes. This waste meets 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as hazardous and is capable of posing a significant present or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential hazard to human health or the environment. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingestion of contaminated ground water, EPA calculated high-end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual risk levels for three carcinogens that exceed 1E&hyph;4 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal in an unlined on-site surface impoundment, the plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management scenario. The calculated combined carcinogenic risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these constituents is 3E&hyph;4 from exposure to contaminated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ground water for the surface impoundment management scenario. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further support this listing, four additional contaminants pose 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual risks between 1E&hyph;4 and 1E&hyph;6 for the surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Data from the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire show that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1991 volume reported by the industry for the wastewater stream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from azo pigment production is 9,914,662 metric tons, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approximately 7.2 million gallons per day. Over 75% of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters from azo pigment manufacturing currently are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pretreated and discharged to a publicly owned treatment works 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(POTW). Most of these wastewaters are treated in equalization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and neutralization tanks prior to discharge to a POTW. A smaller 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
percentage of these wastewaters is subjected to aerobic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
biological treatment in tanks, with subsequent NPDES discharge to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a surface water. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As explained under Section II.D, Description of Health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Risk Assessments, the risk assessment for these wastewaters was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed using treatment in tanks as the current, or baseline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management practice, and treatment in surface impoundments as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plausible management scenario. The risks of increased cancer for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exposure to this waste are presented in Table II&hyph;5. The data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented in this table represent six samples collected from four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
azo pigment manufacturing facilities.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The calculated risks associated with managing these wastewaters in surface impoundments are very high. Three constituents
are considered to pose a substantial potential hazard to human health and the environment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, risks exceed 1E&hyph;4). Calculated risks for each of these three compounds are 1E&hyph;4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Three of the constituents that have been projected to pose a risk greater than 1E&hyph;6, namely, acetoacetanilide
(AAA), acetoacet-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
o
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-toluidide (AAOT), and acetoacet-
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
o
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-anisidide (AAOA), are high-volume coupling reactants used in the manufacture of azo pigments. As explained above
for K162, these constituents are dominant raw materials in the azo pigment manufacturing industry and generally
are present in the wastewater treatment systems at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these sites. As shown in Table II&hyph;5, the risks calculated by these compounds range from 1E&hyph;4 to 1E&hyph;6.
As stated for K162, these risks were calculated using metabolic product structural-activity relationships (SAR)
for these compounds, an approach which is discussed in detail in Section II.D of this preamble, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and in the Listing Background Document for this proposed rule, which is located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking
(See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table II&hyph;4, presented earlier, shows that AAA and AAOA were detected in all of the wastewater samples collected
from facilities that use these reactants. AAOT was found only in one of four wastewater samples, but it was found in
all four of the sludge samples collected from facilities using the compound. The Agency believes that the latter compound
generally is present in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wastewater treatment system at facilities that use AAOT as a raw material but that it may be preferentially partitioning
to the sludge. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the high risks calculated by the three reactants, AAA, AAOA, and AAOT, the hydrolysis products of these
compounds, aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline, also were detected in the waste at concentrations that
pose significant risk (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, risks ranging from 1E&hyph;4 to 4E&hyph;6). Discussions addressing hydrolysis pathways and conditions for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these compounds, and the issue of coeluting compounds associated with the hydrolysis products, were presented earlier
in this preamble (see discussion of K162, and Section II.D). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the primary raw materials and breakdown products presented above, the combined 2,4- and 2,6-isomers
of dimethylaniline, which also are suspected raw material breakdown products, were detected in this waste at concentrations
that pose a very high risk (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, a risk of 1E&hyph;4). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Along with risks associated with the individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers the combined
risks of constituents that co-exist in the wastestream. In the case of wastewaters generated from the manufacture
of azo pigments, all of the reactants and breakdown products previously discussed in this section (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, AAA, AAOT, AAOA, aniline, 2-aminotoluene, and 2-methoxyaniline) are assumed to co-exist in the wastestream. The
reactants are used in producing numerous large-volume pigments that are manufactured on a frequent basis. Since
this wastewater stream represents several commingled wastestreams from throughout the plant, the constituents
are likely to be present simultaneously in the waste. Therefore, the combined risks of these individual constituents,
which are projected to be very high under the surface impoundment mismanagment scenario (i.e., 3E&hyph;4 at the high
end), also were considered in making this listing determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the calculated risks associated with the plausible management practice for this waste (treatment in surface
impoundments), EPA is proposing to list wastewaters from the production of azo pigments as a hazardous waste, designated
EPA Hazardous Waste Number K163. However, the Agency recognizes that if wastewater treatment sludges from the production
of azo pigments (K162) are listed as proposed, the available options for wastewater management may change and the
surface impoundment scenario may not be plausible for the following reason: wastewaters that are managed in an impoundment
will generate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludges through precipitation. In the event that K162 sludges were listed and the wastewaters were not, the sludges
generated in a Subtitle D wastewater impoundment would be hazardous wastes and the surface impoundment would become
subject to RCRA Subtitle C regulation. The Agency is requesting comment on whether the use of Subtitle D surface impoundments
to manage wastewaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be a plausible management scenario if the wastewaters were not listed but the wastewater treatment sludges
were listed as hazardous wastes. The Agency also is requesting comment on the need to list K163 wastewaters, given
that the plausibility of the management scenario on which the risk assessment was based may be affected by the final
outcome of the K162 sludge listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, EPA proposes to add the following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis for
Listing: Aniline, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, 2-aminotoluene, 3-aminotoluene, 4-aminotoluene,

Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing to list wastewater treatment sludge from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&amp;C colorants, as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous waste. This wastestream meets the criteria set out at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as hazardous and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capable of posing a substantial present or potential risk to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human health or the environment. Based on ingestion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated ground water, EPA calculated high-end individual 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cancer risk levels for five constituents which exceed 1E&hyph;4 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogens and have HQs of 1 or greater for non-carcinogens for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the plausible management practice, an on-site monofill. Four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
additional contaminants further support the listing by posing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual risks between 1E&hyph;4 and 1E&hyph;6. Risks between 1E&hyph;4 and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1E&hyph;6 also were identified for six contaminants from exposure to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these constituents through other exposure pathways.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed earlier under Section II.D, Description of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health and Risk Assessments, the Agency conducted the risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment on these wastestreams using both a current, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
baseline management scenario, and a plausible management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario. Information relating to this discussion is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included at the present time due to business confidentiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Agency conducted the risk assessment on two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current management scenarios, a municipal landfill, and a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monofill, with the monofill representing the plausible management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risk projections associated with this wastestream are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented in Table II&hyph;6. The data presented in this table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
represent 18 samples collected from four azo dye manufacturing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities. Eleven of the 18 samples were collected and analyzed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by industry, and were submitted to EPA for evaluation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risks associated with disposing these sludges in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monofills are projected to be very high. Five constituents found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the waste are predicted to pose individual high-end cancer-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk levels equal to or exceeding 1E&hyph;4 or HQs equal to or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding 1 for non-carcinogens, through ingestion of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated ground water or vegetables. The five constituents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pose carcinogenic risks ranging from 1E&hyph;4 to 5E&hyph;4 and non- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogenic hazards from 2 to 45 times above the RfDs for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monofill management scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There are two cases of coeluting constituents for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream. As shown in Table II&hyph;6, there is one data point for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the mass spectrum indicates the presence of 2- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
methoxyaniline, along with the potential presence of 2- and 4- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aminoaniline. As discussed in Section II.D, EPA based the risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment for this set of coeluting compounds on 2-aminoaniline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level for 2- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aminoaniline is 5E&hyph;4 for the monofill management scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second set of coeluting compounds consists of the three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isomers 2-, 3-, and 4-aminotoluene. The presence of the three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
isomers was confirmed in four out of six wastewater samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected from azo dye manufacturing operations, and the combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of the three compounds was quantified. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level, based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity of 2-aminotoluene, is 1E&hyph;4 for the monofill management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario (See Section II.D of this preamble, Coeluting Compounds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for more details on the Agency's approach to risk assessment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coeluting compounds). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the two sets of coeluting compounds used as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw materials in azo dye manufacturing, three compounds, 1,3- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dinitrobenzene, 4-methylphenol, and 2,4-dinitrophenol were found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
at concentrations that are projected to pose a substantial risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to human health and the environment. The risks presented by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these compounds are calculated to have high-end HQs of 45, 3, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2, respectively.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Aniline is a high-volume dye reactant present in the wastewater treatment sludge at multiple facilities, according
to RCRA Section 3007 questionnaire data. Aniline is the fourth highest-volume reactant used in the dye industry,
according to data provided in the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaires, with a 1991 use volume of 4860 metric tons.
Based on the aniline concentrations found in the waste, the Agency has calculated a high-end individual cancer-risk
level for this constituent at 1E&hyph;5.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Aniline was found in over 70% of the samples of wastewater treatment sludge from azo dye production. However, 11 of
the 13 aniline data points, which were all from one facility, were dropped prior to the risk assessment because the
facility reported that aniline found in the wastewater treatment sludges is associated with non-dye operations.
This facility consumes larger volumes of aniline in their non-dye operations than in the manufacture of azo dyes.
It is likely that aniline from dye operations contributed to the presence of the constituent in the waste; however,
the Agency could not determine the extent of this contribution.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In studying the wastewater treatment systems from azo dye manufacturing operations as a whole, the Agency found aniline
to be present in all systems from which samples were collected. In addition, aniline was consistently present in the
wastewaters for all samples collected. Furthermore, even though aniline would be expected to biodegrade in the wastewater
treatment system, aniline was present in 2 out of 5 samples from the wastewater treatment sludge. Because the wastewater
treatment sludge presents a complex matrix for chemical analysis, the detection limits obtained for the wastewater
treatment sludges were high. Therefore, the Agency believes that, given the consistent presence of aniline in the
wastewater, and the detection of aniline in 2 out of 5 sludge samples (with 11 data points dropped for the reasons stated
earlier), aniline typically is present in wastewater treatment sludges from azo dye manufacturing operations.
Based on the aniline concentrations found in the two data points that remain after 11 data points were dropped, the
Agency has determined that the risk posed by aniline in this wastestream is significant.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An additional high-volume raw material used in the manufacture of azo dyes, 3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine, was found
to be present in the wastewater treatment sludge from azo dye operations at concentrations that result in calculated
high-end individual cancer-risk level of 2E&hyph;5. Based on data from the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire,
1719 metric tons of 3,3'-dimethyoxybenzidine were used in the manufacture of azo dyes in 1991.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the risks posed by the individual hazardous constituents found in the waste, some of the contaminants
are co-occurring in this wastestream. The Agency found that sludge samples collected from each of the four azo dye
manufacturing facilities generally contain one or more toxic raw materials simultaneously. Therefore, some individual
carcinogens are co-occurring in the waste and the calculated risks are assumed to be additive. Given the waste characterization
and risk assessment results, along with toxicity information on other raw materials used in the production of azo
dyes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, aromatic amines), the Agency believes that wastewater treatment sludges from azo dye manufacturing typically
contain one or more toxic raw materials at concentrations that pose a significant risk.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the azo dye raw materials that were found in the wastestream at concentrations that pose a high risk,
two additional constituents, 2-methoxy-5-nitroaniline, and the two coeluting compounds diphenylamine and N-nitrosodiphenylamine,
were found in the wastewater treatment sludge from azo dye operations at concentrations that pose carcinogenic risks
above 1E&hyph;6 (See Section II.D for treatment of coeluting compounds).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The results from the assessment of exposure pathways other than drinking contaminated ground water resulting from
management in an on-site monofill also are presented in Table II&hyph;6. Calculated high-end individual cancer-risk
levels between 1E&hyph;4 and 1E&hyph;6 were identified for six contaminants through indirect exposure pathways
(contaminated vegetable ingestion) if airborne dusts are not controlled.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the risks posed by the monofill management practice, the calculated risk posed by municipal landfill
disposal also is within EPA's range of potential concern, 1E&hyph;6 to 1E&hyph;4, for two sets of coeluting compounds,
2- and 4-aminoaniline/2-methoxyaniline, and 2- and 4-aminotoluene. The Agency also considered the risks posed
by these contaminants for a municipal landfill when making the listing decision.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on an analysis of the risks associated with the current management practices, a monofill and municipal landfill,
EPA is proposing to list as hazardous wastewater treatment sludge from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&amp;C
colorants, designated EPA Hazardous Waste Number K164.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, the Agency is proposing to add the following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis
for Listing: 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, aniline, diphenylamine, N-nitrosodiphenylamine,
3,3'-dimethoxybenzidine, 4-methylphenol, 1,3-dinitrobenzene, 2-methoxy-5-nitroaniline, 2,4-dinitrophenol,
2-aminotoluene, and 4-aminotoluene.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, N-nitrosodiphenylamine, 4-methylphenol,
1,3-dinitrobenzene, and 2-methoxy-5-nitroaniline are proposed to be added to Appendix VIII to Part 261_Hazardous

The Agency is proposing to list wastewaters from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&amp;C colorants, as hazardous.
This wastestream meets the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as hazardous and is capable of
posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment. Based on ingestion of contaminated
ground water, EPA calculated a high-end individual risk level of 1E&hyph;4 for one hazardous constituent for the
plausible management scenario, treatment in an unlined surface impoundment. Two additional constituents are estimated
to pose risks between 1E&hyph;4 and 1E&hyph;6 for the surface impoundment scenario.

Based on response data from the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire, the volume reported by the industry for wastewaters
from azo dye production, excluding FD&amp;C colorants, was 6,295,779 metric tons per year, or 4.6 million gallons
per day. Approximately 58% of wastewaters from azo dye production, excluding FD&amp;C colorants currently are pretreated
and discharged to a POTW. Over 40% of these wastewaters are treated in aerobic biological tank systems, with subsequent
NPDES discharge to a surface water. Approximately 5% of the wastewaters from azo dye operations excluding FD&amp;C
colorants are treated in biological treatment systems that use surface impoundments.

As discussed earlier under Section II.D, Description of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Health and Risk Assessments, the risk assessment for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters was performed using treatment in tanks as the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current, or baseline, management practice, and treatment in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface impoundments as a plausible management scenario. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this waste, however, the worst-case management scenario, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment in a surface impoundment, is also one of the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management practices. The calculated risks of increased cancer 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or hazard quotient above one for exposure to this waste are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presented in Table II&hyph;7. The data presented in this table 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The risk associated with the wastewaters in tanks is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated to be below levels of concern. However, the risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with managing these wastewaters in surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundments are calculated to be high. One constituent found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the waste is considered capable of posing a substantial present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or potential risk to human health or the environment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are 1E&hyph;4 or higher for carcinogens, or 1 or higher HQs for non-carcinogens). The constituent poses a risk 1E&hyph;4.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As was the case with wastewater treatment sludge from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of azo dyes, excluding FD&amp;C colorants, the wastewaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were found to contain high concentrations of aniline, a high-volume dye reactant that poses an unacceptable risk
at such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels. In fact, aniline was present in each of the seven 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater samples from azo dye production. However, two of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seven aniline data points, which were both from one facility, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were dropped prior to the risk assessment because the facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reported that aniline found in the wastewater is associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-dye operations. This facility consumes larger volumes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aniline in their non-dye operations than in the manufacture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
azo dyes. It is likely that aniline from dye operations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributed to the presence of the constituent in the waste; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
however, the Agency could not determine the extent of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contribution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the aniline concentrations represented by the five 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining data points, the Agency has determined that the risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
posed by aniline in this wastestream are 2E&hyph;6). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The presence of three coeluting isomers, 2-, 3-, and 4-
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aminotoluene, was confirmed in four out of six wastewater samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected from azo dye manufacturing operations, and the combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration of the three compounds was quantified (refer to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
earlier discussion under Section II.D.2, Coeluting Compounds, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a discussion on the coelution of 2-, 3-, and 4-aminotoluene). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level, based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the toxicity of 2-aminotoluene, is 1E&hyph;4 for the surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment management scenario.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second set of coeluting compounds consists of 2- and 4- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aminoaniline, and 2-methoxyaniline. EPA based the risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment for this set of coeluting compounds on 2-aminoaniline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as discussed in Section II.D.2. The resulting calculated high- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
end individual cancer-risk level is 1E&hyph;5 for the surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment management scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on the risks associated with the plausible management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice for this waste, EPA is proposing to list wastewaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the production of azo dyes, excluding FD&amp;C colorants, as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous waste, designated EPA Hazardous Waste Number K165. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the Agency recognizes that if wastewater treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludges from the production of azo dyes (K164) are listed as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed, the available options for wastewater management may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change and surface impoundments may not be used. Wastewaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are managed in an impoundment will generate sludges through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
precipitation. In the event that K164 sludges were listed and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wastewaters were not, the sludges generated in a Subtitle D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater impoundment would be hazardous wastes and the surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment would become subject to RCRA Subtitle C regulation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is requesting comment on whether it would be plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to use a Subtitle D surface impoundment to manage wastewaters if 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the wastewaters were not listed and the wastewater treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludges were listed as hazardous wastes. The Agency also is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requesting comment on the need to list K165 wastewaters, given 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the plausibility of the worst-case management scenario on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which the risk assessment was based may be affected by the K164 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludge listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, EPA proposes to add the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Listing: 2-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, 2-aminotoluene, 3- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aminotoluene, 4-aminotoluene, and aniline. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, 2-aminoaniline, 4-aminoaniline, 2-methoxyaniline and 3-aminotoluene are proposed to be added to

This waste is generated from the treatment of wastewaters from triarylmethane dye and pigment manufacturing. These
wastewaters often are commingled with wastewaters from the manufacture of other dyes and pigments. As a result, the
wastewater treatment sludges typically are managed also as a commingled wastestream from the production of triarylmethane
and any other dyes or pigments manufactured at the site. Based on the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data, the 1991
volume reported by the industry for this wastestream is 1,404 metric tons. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments is generated at only five facilities.
The Agency's sampling program, which was conducted in support of this listing determination, included wastewater
treatment sludge from one of the five facilities generating this waste. However, the facility was not manufacturing
triarylmethane dyes or pigments during the time of the sampling activities. Therefore, the resulting absence of
constituents attributable to the triarylmethane operations was not unexpected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, based on insufficient characterization data, the Agency proposes to defer a listing decision on wastewater
treatment sludges from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments
using aniline as a feedstock). The Agency is proposing to conduct additional sampling on this wastestream and will
publish a supplemental notice with a proposed listing determination.

Volume information reported by the industry in the 1992 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire for the wastewater stream
from triarylmethane dye and pigment production is not included at the present time due to business confidentiality
concerns. Wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane dyes and pigments (excluding triarylmethane pigments
using aniline as a feedstock) often are commingled with wastewaters from the manufacture of azos and other dyes and
pigments.

Information on the percentage of these wastewaters currently 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pretreated and discharged to a POTW, and on the percentage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treated in a biological treatment system and discharged to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surface water under the NPDES system is not included at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present time due to business confidentiality concerns. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussed earlier under Section II.D, Description of Health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Risk Assessments, the risk assessment for these wastewaters was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed using treatment in tanks and surface impoundments as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the baseline and plausible management practices, respectively. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes that the three wastewater samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected from the manufacture of triarylmethane dyes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigments are representative of the industry, in part, because 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater samples were collected from the two largest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triarylmethane dye producers in the country. Furthermore, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chemical analyses conducted on this waste encompassed the most 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
important raw materials used in the manufacture of triarylmethane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dyes and pigments, and these compounds were not detected at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations that pose a significant risk. For example, N,N-dimethylaniline is a large volume raw material used
in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture of triarylmethane dyes and pigment, and was analyzed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrophotometry analytical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
method. In addition to the GC/MS analysis, specific analyses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were conducted in order to look for two additional toxic raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials for triarylmethane dyes and pigments; chloranil and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
another raw material that cannot be identified due to business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality concerns. As shown in Table II&hyph;8, N,N- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dimethylaniline and the other raw material that cannot be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified were not found in these wastewaters at concentrations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that pose a significant risk, and chloranil was not detected at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all in the wastewaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Table II&hyph;8 presents eight constituents, obtained from three 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater samples which were collected at three out of 14 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities that manufacture triarylmethane dyes or pigments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These eight compounds are the constituents that were found to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to the triarylmethane processes, and six of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
eight compounds were dropped following the risk assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
screening (see the Listing and Risk Assessment for Dye and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pigment Waste Listing Determination Background Documents for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule, located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section) for the process used in identifying 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable constituents and for the process used for dropping 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds after risk screening, respectively). Because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds are not expected to bioaccumulate, the maximum measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of those constituents with HBLs in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream were compared to their HBLs, and the ratio of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations to HBL values was less than 1, indicating that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of these compounds in the waste are not expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to pose a risk to human health or the environment. The two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining constituents, 4-nitroaniline and a constituent that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be identified at the present time due to confidentiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns, were detected at low concentrations and do not have 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HBLs needed to conduct a risk assessment. The risks posed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these two constituents, however, were assessed using surrogate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds. Neither of the compounds are expected to be potential 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogens. Furthermore, the Agency selected surrogate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds that are structurally similar to the compounds detected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the waste, and are estimated, by means of structural activity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationships (SARs), to be more toxic than the subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds. Nitrobenzene was selected as a surrogate for 4-nitroaniline. Surrogate information on the second constituent

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cannot be included at the present time due to business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality concerns. The ratios of concentration to HBL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HQ) determined by this analysis were also less than 1, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
indicating that, if the contaminant concentrations found in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste were actually present in drinking water, the risks posed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
ingesting the drinking water would be insignificant. More 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detailed discussions on the risk assessment screening and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrogate compounds are presented in the Dye and Pigment Listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Support Health Effects Background Document, which is located in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
ADDRESSES 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, because the constituents in this waste were 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed at concentrations that present low risk levels, and no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other hazardous constituents attributed to triarylmethane dye or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigment production were detected, the Agency is proposing not to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list wastewaters from the manufacture of triarylmethane dyes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigments as hazardous.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4.Wastes from the production of triarylmethane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigments using aniline as a feedstock. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently are produced at two domestic facilities. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities each produce a single product which is manufactured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
throughout the year using aniline as the major feedstock. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two processes are markedly different from other dye and pigment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
processes in the industry. Most dye and pigment processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture numerous products on a batch basis, using different 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw materials for each product. The wastes generated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
typical dye manufacturing plants vary in composition over time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to the constant changes in raw materials. In contrast, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated at facilities that are dedicated to the manufacture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one product continuously throughout the year, and use only two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
raw materials, aniline and formaldehyde, at the site. In 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition, aniline is used in excess in the process. These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
differences have a significant impact on the compositions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste. Such wastes were expected, and found, to contain high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of aniline. The listing Background Document, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
found in the RCRA docket (see 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->

section) for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rulemaking, contains details on the process for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing triarylmethane (TAM) pigments using aniline as a

Summary
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing not to list as hazardous wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment sludges from the production of triarylmethane pigments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using aniline as a feedstock. If this wastestream were managed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by disposal in a municipal landfill (the plausible management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario used for other wastewater treatment sludges), it would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
meet the criteria set out at 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste as hazardous and would be capable of posing a substantial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present or potential hazard to human health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, as discussed in Section II.D, Description of Health and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Risk Assessments, the Agency has determined that management in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
municipal landfill is not plausible for this wastestream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Despite this determination, for comparison purposes the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
calculated the risks associated with disposal in a municipal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landfill and with diposal in an on-site boiler. If, based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments, the Agency determines that it is not reasonable to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fuel blending as the plausible management scenario, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
probably would determine that plausible management is disposal in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a municipal landfill for the ground-water pathway, and is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal in an on-site boiler for the air pathway. Disposal in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an on-site monofill, which was established as the plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management scenario for other wastewater treatment sludges (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
K162 and K164), is not a practical option for this wastestream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to its low volume relative to the capacity of a monofill, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
so is not feasible economically. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on ingestion of contaminated ground water due to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
releases from a municipal landfill, EPA calculated high-end 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual cancer-risk levels of 1E&hyph;4 and 8E&hyph;5 for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents benzidine and aniline, respectively. The coeluting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene are calculated to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pose risks between 1E&hyph;6 and 1E&hyph;5. Therefore, the combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
carcinogenic risk for multiple co-existing constituents in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream would be 2E&hyph;4, assuming disposal in a landfill. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the risks associated with the current and plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management practice, blending with non-hazardous fuel, are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insignificant for any constituent. Thus, the Agency is proposing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not to list it as hazardous.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock currently is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generated at only one facility. This waste is generated from a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
filter press that is used as part of the wastewater pretreatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. The waste is generated at a rate of approximately 18 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
metric tons per year. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has summarized the risk projections associated with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sludge in Table II&hyph;9. The data presented in this table represent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
one sample from one facility. Unlike earlier wastestreams, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health benchmarks exist for all the contaminants detected in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream (with the exception of one coeluting compound, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is discussed later in this section). Additional compounds which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
do have health benchmarks, however, have been identified in these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes, but were dropped from further consideration following the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk screening. The complete list of compounds found in this and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other wastestreams is presented in the Listing Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Document for this proposed rule, which is located in the RCRA

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As shown in Table II&hyph;9, benzidine is present in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream at concentrations that pose a substantial risk to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human health and the environment (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, equal to or greater than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1E&hyph;5 for carcinogens) for the municipal landfill management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario. Benzidine was found to be present in several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestreams from the manufacture of triarylmethane pigments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using aniline as a feedstock, including wastewaters from both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities that manufacture these pigments. The Agency believes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that benzidine is either a raw material contaminant or a reaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by-product from the process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Large quantities of aniline, typically in excess, are used 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a raw material to this process. As a result, this wastestream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was found to contain over three percent aniline. The calculated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high-end individual cancer-risk level for aniline is 8E&hyph;5 for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landfill scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to benzidine and aniline, the waste was found to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contain two other hazardous constituents that are believed to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by-products of the reaction and pose a significant risk at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations detected for the municipal landfill management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario. Two additional compounds presented in Table II&hyph;9, 1,2- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diphenylhydrazine and azobenzene, coelute on the mass spectrum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(see Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for a discussion on the Agency's approach to risk assessment for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coeluting compounds). Both compounds are likely oxidation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
products of aniline, and may be present in the waste as reaction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by-products. In addition to the uncertainty in establishing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations for each of the two compounds, the chemical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathway from aniline to these oxidation products suggests that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either contaminant may be present at all or part of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration detected. The Agency conducted the risk assessment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
using the health-based levels for 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
azobenzene, independently. For disposal in a municipal landfill, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the calculated high-end individual cancer-risk level for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
coeluting compounds, based on the toxicity of 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, is 2E&hyph;5. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to assessing the risks associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the combined risk of constituents that co-exist in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream. In the case of this wastewater treatment sludge, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
all of the constituents discussed above (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, aniline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzidine, and 1,2-diphenylhydrazine/azobenzene) are believed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
co-exist in the wastestream. The processes that produce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operated continuously all year. As a result, the constituents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected in the wastestream are likely to be present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
simultaneously in the waste. Therefore, the combined calculated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk of these individual constituents, for the municipal landfill 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario would be 2E&hyph;4 at the high end. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, the risks associated with the current and plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management practice for this wastestream (blending with non-hazardous fuel for combustion) are insignificant.
As discussed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency believes that the fuel blending will continue. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relatively high organic content of the waste gives the material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
value as a fuel ingredient and, therefore, generators of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste have an economic incentive to continue fuel blending. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Therefore, the Agency is proposing not to list the wastestream as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous. If the NPDES program requirements were to change 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, become more stringent) then those triarylmethane pigment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
producers that currently do not generate a sludge could be forced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to generate a sludge due to their efforts to meet new NPDES 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements. In that case, the plausible management scenario 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would change, and other practices, such as landfilling, would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
become possible. The Agency may reopen this listing decision 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should this occur, and will use the risk levels associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this management scenario to make a revised listing determination.

Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing not to list as hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters from the production of triarylmethane pigments using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aniline as a feedstock. As shown in Table II&hyph;10, these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters contain an average aniline concentration of 200 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, the wastewaters contain the same hazardous by-products found in the wastewater treatment sludge. Although
this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream, if managed in surface impoundments, would meet the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
criteria set out in 40 CFR 261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous and would be capable of posing a substantial present or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential risk to human health or the environment if released 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
into the environment, the Agency has determined that management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in surface impoundments is not plausible for this wastestream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes this because 100% of this wastestream is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
managed in exempt tanks. The Agency has no reason to believe 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that this management practice will change. Risk associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment in tanks is insignificant and, thus, the Agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposing not to list this waste as hazardous. However, for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comparison purposes, the Agency has calculated the risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with disposal of this wastestream in a surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundment. If, based on comments, the Agency determines that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it is not reasonable to assume that management in tanks is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
correct plausible management scenario, the Agency probably would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine that management in a surface impoundment is the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
appropriate plausible management scenario.

These wastewaters are generated from filtrations of process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
intermediates and products, flushing operations, equipment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
washdowns, floor washings, and process operations. Based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
response data from the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire, a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
total of 757,080 metric tons, or 0.4 million gallons per day, of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater from the production of triarylmethane (TAM) pigments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is generated. Information on generation relevant to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion is not included at the present time due to business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality concerns. All of the wastewaters generated from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TAM pigment production (using aniline as a feedstock) are treated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in tanks prior to discharge to a POTW. The data presented in Table II&hyph;10 represent three samples collected from
two TAM pigment-manufacturing facilities.

As discussed earlier under Section II.D, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plausible management scenario selected for wastewaters usually is treatment in surface 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impoundments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risks associated with disposing these wastewaters in surface impoundments would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very high. Two hazardous constituents (aniline and benzidine) are present in the waste at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations that would pose substantial risks to human health and the environment (

than 1E&hyph;4 for carcinogens) for treatment in a surface impoundment. Large quantities of aniline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in excess, are used as a raw material in this process. As a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
result, very high concentrations of aniline are present in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process waters. Even after recovery operations, EPA found high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of aniline (in this case, an average of 200 ppm) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remaining in the wastewater effluent discharged to the POTW. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Benzidine was found to be present in several wastestreams 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the manufacture of triarylmethane pigments using aniline as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a feedstock, and is believed to be either a raw material 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminant or a reaction by-product. The risks posed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
benzidine at the concentrations present in these wastewaters are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3E&hyph;4, using a surface impoundment management scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coeluting constituents, 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
azobenzene, which are likely by-products arising from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
oxidation of aniline are present in the waste at a concentration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting in a calculated risk level of 1E&hyph;5, based on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity of 1,2-diphenylhydrazine (see Section II.D, Description 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of Health and Risk Assessments, for a discussion on the Agency's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach to risk assessment for coeluting compounds). The mass 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
spectrum representing these two coeluting compounds was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified in all three wastewater samples collected from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triarylmethane pigment operations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, based on the insignificant risks associated with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the current and plausible management practice for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream (treatment in tanks), EPA is proposing not to list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters from the production of TAM pigments as hazardous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although this wastestream would be hazardous if used for spray 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
irrigation or handled in surface impoundments, the Agency does 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not believe that such management is plausible. The facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generating the wastewater already are 100% invested in treating 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the waste in tanks prior to sending it to a POTW. In addition, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this is not a strongly expanding segment of the industry, so the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency does not anticipate more facilities starting up similar 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
operations. Further, there is a general bias under most State 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industrial waste programs against allowing surface impoundments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be built. Thus, based on the risk associated with treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in tanks, the Agency is proposing not to list this wastestream as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous.

Summary 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing to list still bottoms or heavy ends 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the production of triarylmethane dyes or pigments as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous. This wastestream meets the criteria set out at 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
261.11(a)(3) for listing a waste as hazardous and is capable of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
posing a substantial present or potential risk to human health or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the environment. Based on ingestion of contaminated ground 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water, EPA calculated high-end individual risk levels (greater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
than 1E&hyph;4) for carcinogens under both the baseline and plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management scenarios. Two carcinogens pose high-end risks 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exceeding 9E&hyph;3 for the plausible management scenario of disposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in an on-site monofill. These two constituents pose very high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of risk (greater than 1E&hyph;3) for the baseline management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practice of disposal in a municipal landfill. In addition, one 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of these constituents has an HQ of 6 for the air pathway 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with management in an on-site boiler, a practice which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is both a baseline management practice and a plausible management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario.

Information relevant to this discussion is not included at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the present time due to business confidentiality concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Process waters from the manufacture of triarylmethane dyes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and pigments containing high levels of aniline or other raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials and solvents sometimes are sent to a distillation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
column for recovery of the material for reuse in the process. As 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expected, the bottoms generated from the distillation contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
high concentrations of the material being recovered. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations of aniline present in two samples collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemplify the concentrations of solvent contaminants anticipated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in these wastes. Information on the concentration of aniline 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
observed is not presented at his time due to business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on data from the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
four facilities generated a total of 1700 metric tons of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste in 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA has summarized the risk projections associated with this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste in Table II&hyph;11. The data presented in this table represent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two samples from two facilities. These samples were collected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the two largest generators of this wastestream, both of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which recover aniline from the wastewater. One of the remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two facilities recovers other aniline derivatives (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 N,N- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dimethylaniline and N,N-diethylaniline) that are used as raw 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
materials and solvents in the production of triarylmethane dyes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The second facility recovers chlorobenzene used as a solvent in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the production of triarylmethane dyes and generates a still 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
bottom waste that is reported to contain 50% chlorobenzene. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste is already listed as F002, based on the use of the solvent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
chlorobenzene. Based on an evaluation of the processes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generating these wastes and the contaminants reported to be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present by industry, the Agency believes the risks posed are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar to those assessed in Table II&hyph;11. The data used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterize these wastestreams, assess the risks posed by these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes, and make a proposed listing determination on the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grouping were obtained from the two samples collected by EPA and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire responses. Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management information relevant to this discussion are not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included at the present time due to business confidentiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As discussed earlier in Section II.D, Description of Health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and Risk Assessments, the Agency conducted the risk assessment on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these wastestreams using the two most widely used practices, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on-site boiler and municipal landfill as the current management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
scenario, and an on-site boiler (for the air pathway) and on-site 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monofill (for the ground-water pathway) as the plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management scenario. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risk posed by the presence of aniline in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations found in the waste is estimated to be very high 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
greater than 9E&hyph;3 for the ground-water pathway, and HQ=6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for the air pathway). Due to the imperfect nature of any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recovery process, it is not unexpected that large quantities of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aniline, or any other raw material or solvent being recovered, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be present in these still bottoms. Aniline was found in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
very high concentrations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 the low concentration was 1.9%) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in both distillation bottom samples collected from triarylmethane 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigment production. Information on the high concentration value 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is not included at the present time due to business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to aniline, the two sets of coeluting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents present in the wastewater treatment sludge and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters from these operations (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1,2-diphenylhydrazine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and azobenzene, and N-nitrosodiphenylamine and diphenylamine) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also are present in the distillation bottoms (K166). These 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds are all likely by-products arising from the oxidation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of aniline. The MS curve representing 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
azobenzene was identified in both distillation bottom samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected from triarylmethane pigment operations. For the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reasons discussed in Section II.D, the Agency conducted the risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment for these coeluting compounds independently. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting high-end individual cancer-risk level for this first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set of coeluting compounds is greater than 9E&hyph;3. Likewise, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk assessment for N-nitrosodiphenylamine and diphenylamine was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted independently, as discussed in Section II.D. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resulting high-end individual cancer-risk level for this second 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
set of coeluting compounds is 6E&hyph;6. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to assessing the risks associated with the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the combined risks of constituents that co-exist in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream. In the case of still bottoms from the production of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
triarylmethane dyes and pigments, all of the constituents are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
believed to co-exist in the wastestream. The distillation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
columns generating this residual process the same wastestream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with each dye or pigment batch. As a result, the constituents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected are likely to be present simultaneously in the waste. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The risk of each individual constituent is high, and the combined 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risks of these constituents are very high (greater than 9E&hyph;3 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the ground-water pathway and 6E&hyph;5 for the air pathway), both of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which were considered in making this listing determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the very high risks posed by the plausible 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management practice (on-site boiler for the air pathway and on-site monofill for the ground-water pathway), the
risks posed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the baseline management practice (on-site boiler for the air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathway and municipal landfill for the ground-water pathway) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
also very high. Specifically, the risks posed by the current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management practices are greater than 9E&hyph;3 for the ground-water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pathway, and 6E&hyph;5 (carcinogens) and HQ=6 (non-carcinogens) for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the air pathway. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the calculated risks associated with managing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these still bottoms in on-site boilers, municipal landfills, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on-site monofills are all very high, based on each of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
individual hazardous constituents in the wastestream and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
combined risks due to carcinogens found in the wastestream as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whole. Therefore, based on the risks associated with both 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
current management and plausible management practices for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste, EPA is proposing to list as hazardous still bottoms or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigments, designated EPA Hazardous Waste Number K166. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For the reasons stated above, the Agency is proposing to add 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for Listing: 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, azobenzene, aniline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
diphenylamine, and N-nitrosodiphenylamine. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, azobenzene and N-nitrosodiphenylamine are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed to be added to Appendix VIII to Part 261_Hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Constituents.

EPA is proposing to defer the proposed listing determination

for wastewater treatment sludges from the production of

anthraquinone dyes and pigments at this time. Based on analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the sludge samples collected by the Agency, no constituents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
attributable to anthraquinone processes were detected. However, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data supplied by industry indicate the presence of two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents on the target analyte list for which no health-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels and no adequate surrogates exist. Based on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discrepancy and the need to identify surrogates for risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anthraquinone dyes and pigments is generated at 11 facilities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Sludge generated from 9 of the 11 facilities, which represents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
over 98% of the anthraquinone dye and pigment production volume, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is commingled with wastewater treatment sludge from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production of azo pigments and/or dyes. Over 98% of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commingled sludge currently is managed in municipal landfills or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is disposed in on-site monofills. Small fractions of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commingled sludge are managed under Subtitle C. Waste management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and waste volume information relevant to this discussion is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included at the present time due to business confidentiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 11 facilities that generate this waste, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected samples from the three largest contributors to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream and from one small contributor. Several compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in anthraquinone dye or pigment operations were expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be present in the waste, based on facility production schedules, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and were not detected. In addition, analysis of these samples 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
did not produce any other contaminants attributable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anthraquinone dye or pigment operations (refer to the Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

 section) for the methodology used in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying contaminants attributable to a process). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several compounds used in the manufacture of anthraquinone 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dyes and pigments were dropped from the Agency's target analyte 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list for dye and pigment wastes, due to the absence of any health 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
effects information and because of low usage rates (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
., the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compound was used at only 1 or 2 facilities). Examples of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anthraquinone-related compounds dropped from the target analyte 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
list for these reasons include: 1-chloroanthraquinone, 1,4- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dihydroxyanthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid, 1-amino-2-chloro-4- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hydroxyanthraquinone, and 1-amino-4-bromo-2-anthraquinonesulfonic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, the Agency's analysis of wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment sludge samples collected from anthraquinone dye and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigment operations did not produce any contaminants attributable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to anthraquinone dye or pigment operations. However, industry 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
data submitted on 11 sludge samples confirmed the presence of two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
target analytes, 1-aminoanthraquinone, and leucoquinizarine, at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average concentrations of 1.5, and 1.4 ppm, respectively. Each 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the two analytes was detected in three of the 11 samples. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency did not find HBLs for either of the two compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected in this wastestream, 1-aminoanthraquinone and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leucoquinizarine. In addition, the Agency was not able to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identify any appropriate surrogate compounds to represent the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity of these compounds. If one or both of these compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are potential carcinogens and behave in a similar manner to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potential carcinogen, 1-amino-2-methyl-anthraquinone, then the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk posed by the presence of the compounds in the waste would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
need to be examined further. The Agency is concerned about using 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this limited surrogate information as a basis for listing this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste as hazardous. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In summary, the Agency is proposing to defer a listing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determination for wastewater treatment sludge from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture of anthraquinone dyes and pigments at this time, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is requesting data on the toxicity of 1-aminoanthraquinone and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leucoquinizarine or information on suitable surrogates for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds. EPA also would be interested in submission of further 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characterization data. EPA will evaluate carefully all public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments and information received in response to this notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on comments or data received, the Agency, rather than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deferring, may choose to promulgate a final determination to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either list or not to list this waste as hazardous under RCRA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA is proposing not to list wastewaters from the production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of anthraquinone dyes and pigments as hazardous. This 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream is not considered to pose significant risks to human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and the environment, based on the analysis of samples of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the waste. Several compounds used in the manufacture of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anthraquinone dyes and pigments were expected to be present in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the waste but were not detected. Only one compound attributable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to anthraquinone processes, 3-aminoacetanilide, was detected in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the waste, at low concentrations. Health effects information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this constituent does not currently exist, and risk estimates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
conducted using methylenephenylenediamine as a surrogate indicate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
no significant risks.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on response data from the RCRA Section 3007 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Questionnaire, the 1991 volume reported by the industry for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters from anthraquinone dye and pigment production was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3,988,166 metric tons, or approximately 2.9 million gallons per 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
day, generated at 25 facilities. Most of the wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
currently is treated and discharged to a surface water under the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
NPDES system; the remainder is discharged to a POTW (with 5% 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pretreated prior to discharge). Additional information on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volumes and waste managment is not included at the present time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
due to business confidentiality concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Of the 25 facilities that generate this waste, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
collected a total of seven samples from the four largest 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contributors to the wastestream and from one small contributor. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information relevant to this discussion is not included at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present time due to business confidentiality concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As stated above, several compounds used in anthraquinone dye 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and pigment operations were expected to be present in the waste, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on facility production schedules, and were not detected. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, only one compound attributable to anthraquinone dye 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and pigment production was detected in the waste (refer to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background Document for this rulemaking located in the RCRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Docket for this rule (see

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 section) for the methodology 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used in identifying contaminants attributable to a process). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This compound, 3-aminoacetanilide, was present in five of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seven samples collected, at an average concentration of 0.15 ppm. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, health effects information needed to assess the risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
posed by this constituent does not currently exist. In order to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimate the potential risk from 3-aminoacetanilide, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed a risk assessment using methylenephenylenediamine as a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrogate compound. The Agency selected a surrogate compound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that is structurally similar to the compound detected in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 3-aminoacetanilide), and is estimated, by means of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
structural activity relationships (SARs), to be more toxic than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the subject compound. This assessment produced a groundwater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration, prior to dilution and attenuation, of 1.5 times 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the HBL. Thus, the concentration at the receptor well, following 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dilution and attenuation, would be expected to be less than the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HBL. More detailed discussions on the risk assessment screening 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and surrogate compounds are presented in Section II.D of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
preamble, Description of Health and Risk Assessments, and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Listing Background Document for this proposed rule, which is

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
section). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, because the one compound attributable to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
anthraquinone dye or pigment production detected in this waste is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present in low concentrations, does not have health data needed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to assess risk, and does not indicate a risk using surrogate 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
toxicity data, the Agency is proposing not to list wastewaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the manufacture of anthraquinone dyes and pigments as

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Based on the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire data, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume reported by the industry for the wastewater stream from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FD&amp;C colorant production is 3,557,563 metric tons per year, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2.6 million gallons per day. Information on the percentage of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
these wastewaters that are currently pretreated and discharged to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a POTW and other waste management information relevant to this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion is not included at the present time due to business 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
confidentiality concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency collected three samples of wastewaters generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from FD&amp;C operations and did not find any hazardous constituents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present at concentrations that pose a risk above EPA's initial 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk ``level of concern'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 1E&hyph;5 for carcinogens, and HQ of 1 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
or greater). The Agency believes that the samples of wastewaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
from the manufacture of FD&amp;C colorants are representative of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry. In fact, wastewater samples were collected from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
two largest-volume FD&amp;C colorant producers in the country, in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
addition to one smaller manufacturer. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Several of the raw materials used in the manufacture of FD&amp;C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
colorants were dropped from the Agency's target analyte list for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analysis of dye and pigment wastes because the few existing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health studies on these compounds indicate that the compounds are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
non-toxic. In addition, many of the raw materials used in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture of FD&amp;C colorants are compounds that contain sulfonic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acid functional groups, for which analytical methods do not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exist. Examples of FD&amp;C raw materials dropped from the target 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analyte list for these reasons include 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

m
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
-sulfonic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
acid, and sulfanilic acid. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The sulfonic acid functional group imparts water solubility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to a compound, which generally results in lower toxicity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, several of these materials may pose a risk when present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in the wastestream without the sulfonic acid functional group. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For example, without sulfonic acid functional groups, the two 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compounds listed above (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
From the three FD&amp;C wastewater samples collected, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
following three constituents were observed that are attributable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to FD&amp;C colorant production: Aniline, 3-hydroxyphenol, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
phenol. During the risk assessment screening, the Agency found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the three constituents present in the waste (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 aniline, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3-hydroxyphenol, and phenol) do not pose a risk at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations detected. In fact, the ratios of maximum measured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration in the wastestream to the HBL were less than 1 for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
aniline and phenol. Since there currently is no HBL available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for 3-hydroxyphenol, the concentration of 3-hydroxyphenol was 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compared to that of a surrogate. 3-Hydroxyphenol is not expected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to be a potential carcinogen. Furthermore, the Agency selected a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
surrogate compound that is structurally similar to the compound 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
detected in the waste, and is estimated, by means of structural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
activity relationships (SARs), to be more toxic than the subject 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
compound. Therefore, phenol was selected as a surrogate for this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3-hydroxyphenol, and the resulting ratio of concentration to HBL 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
was also less than 1. This indicates that if the contaminant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations found in the waste were actually present in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
drinking water, the risks posed by ingesting the drinking water 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would be insignificant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In conclusion, because the constituents in this wastestream 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were observed at concentrations that present insignificant risks, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and no other hazardous constituents attributed to FD&amp;C colorant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production were detected, the Agency is proposing not to list 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters from the manufacture of FD&amp;C colorants as hazardous.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency is proposing not to list dusts and dust collector 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fines from the manufacture of dyes and pigments because, based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an evaluation of current management and plausible management, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this waste does not pose a substantial potential hazard to human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and the environment.

Discussion 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Dusts and dust collector fines are generated during drying, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
grinding, and blending operations that occur during the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacture of dyes and pigments. Dust collectors and baghouses 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generally are used to capture and collect the dust. The total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volume of this wastestream reported in response to the 1991 RCRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3007 Questionnaire is 143 metric tons. According to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
questionnaire data, some of the dusts and fines reported by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
industry are recovered and recycled back to the manufacturing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process or sold to shoe-polish manufacturers as a raw material. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information on the percentage handled in this manner is not 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
included at the present time due to business confidentiality 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concerns. There is a distinct economic incentive for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities to continue reusing or selling dusts and fines in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
way. This handling of dusts and fines is not expected to present 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any significant risk to human health and the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Seventeen percent of the reported waste volume is generated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
by a facility that currently manages dusts and fines in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle C landfill and the Agency believes that this facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
will continue to manage dusts and fines in such a manner. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dusts and fines generated at this facility from organic pigments 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by this listing determination are mixed with dusts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fines from inorganic pigments that contain lead and chromium. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The entire volume of dusts and fines, comprised of the commingled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic and inorganic products dusts and fines, is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristically toxic for both lead and chromium and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
therefore, is a hazardous waste as defined by 40 CFR 261.24. It 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
is impractical for the facility to separate the dusts and fines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
covered by this listing determination from these characteristic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inorganic dusts and fines and, thus, the facility manages the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dusts and fines covered by this listing determination in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Subtitle C landfill. Analysis of existing plant design shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that dusts and fines are comingled in ductwork that is structured 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
such that these wastes are mixed. Without significant re-design 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and construction, segregation of the wastes is impossible. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency does not believe that it is plausible for the facility to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discontinue the practice of combining all of its dusts and fines 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes and disposing of such wastes at a Subtitle C facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
given the physical arrangement of this facility. Management of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this waste in a Subtitle C landfill is not expected to pose any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
significant level of risk to human health or the environment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Information on the volume and the percentage of total volume 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposed of in Subtitle D landfills is not included at the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
present time due to business confidentiality concerns. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency believes the potential risks posed by the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
plausible management practices for this volume do not warrant a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous waste listing for dusts and fines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although, due to resource constraints, the Agency was unable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to collect information on the characteristics of these dusts and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fines, the Agency estimated a worst-case risk by estimating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
risk associated with disposal of dusts and fines in a Subtitle D 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
landfill based on the physical/chemical properties of a mobile 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
dye product and the toxicological properties of a dye constituent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
known to be one of the most toxic and mobile dye or pigment waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents. This analysis demonstrated that the risk is below 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the initial level of concern associated with disposal of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste in a Subtitle D landfill. Management of this waste in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on-site monofill was determined to be not plausible because the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
volumes generated would not justify an on-site monofill. For 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
further information see the background document on risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment, available in the public docket for this rule. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency requests comment on the approach used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine risk posed by plausible management of the wastes and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comment on the proposed determination not to list this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste.

et 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, November 5, 1990), Congress declared 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pollution prevention the national policy of the United States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The act declares that pollution should be prevented or reduced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whenever feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented should be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recycled or reused in an environmentally safe manner wherever 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented/reduced or recycled 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be treated; and disposal or release into the environment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
should be chosen only as a last resort. This section first 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
provides a general discussion of some generic pollution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
prevention and waste minimization techniques that facilities may 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wish to explore and second discusses and requests comment on ways 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in which the hazardous waste listing determination program itself

A. Generic Approaches to Waste Minimization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Waste minimization practices fall into three general groups: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change in production practices, housekeeping practices, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices that employ the use of equipment that by design promote 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste minimization. Some of these practices/equipment listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
below conserve water, others reduce the amount of product in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream, while others may prevent the creation of the waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
altogether. EPA acknowledges that some of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
practices/equipment may lead to media transfers or increased 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
energy consumption. This information is presented for general 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
information, and is not being proposed as a regulatory 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement. Production practices include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Triple-rinsing raw material shipping containers and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
returning the rinsate directly to the reactor; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Scheduling production to minimize changeover cleanouts; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Segregating equipment by individual product or product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``families;'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Packaging products directly out of reactors; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Steam stripping wastewaters to recovery reactants or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solvents for reuse; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Using raw material drums for packaging final products; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Dedicating equipment for hard to clean products. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Housekeeping practices include: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Performing preventive maintenance on all valves, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
fittings, and pumps; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Promptly correcting any leaky valves and fittings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Placing drip pans under valves and fittings to contain 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
leaks; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Material storage tanks with inert liners to prevent contamination of water blankets with contaminants which
would prohibit its use in the process; and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Enclosed automated product handling equipment to eliminate manual product packaging.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Waste minimization measures can be tailored to the needs of individual industries, processes, and firms. This approach
may make it possible to achieve greater pollution reduction with less cost and disruption to the firm.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Defined process control and good housekeeping practices often can result in significant waste volume or toxicity
reduction. Evaluations of existing processes also may point out the need for more complex engineering approaches
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, waste reuse, secondary processing of distillation bottoms, and use of vacuum pumps instead of steam jets) to achieve
waste minimization objectives. Simple physical audits of current waste generation and in-plant management practices
for the wastes also can yield positive results. These audits often turn up simple non-engineering practices that
can be implemented successfully.

B. Waste Minimization Approaches in the Listing Program
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 1003 of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 says that one of RCRA's goals is to promote protection
of human health and the environment and to conserve valuable material and energy resources by ``minimizing the generation
of hazardous waste and the land disposal of hazardous waste by encouraging process substitution, materials recovery,
properly conducted recycling, and reuse and treatment.'' Section 1003 further provides that it is a national policy
of the United States that, whenever feasible, the generation of hazardous waste is to be reduced or eliminated as expeditiously
as possible. To further EPA's waste minimization goals, the Waste Minimization Branch (WMB) in EPA's Office of Solid
Waste (OSW) established the RCRA Waste Minimization Action Plan to integrate source reduction and recycling into
the National RCRA Program, and RCRA activities into the Agency's Pollution Prevention Strategy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As described in that plan, EPA's program for evaluating which wastes should be listed as hazardous is an example of
a regulatory program that can provide opportunities for encouraging and promoting real waste minimization. When
a wastestream is listed as hazardous, it enters the hazardous waste management system. The requirements of that system
can be costly and there are currently only limited ways for a waste entering the system to get out. Once it is listed as
a hazardous waste, it remains a listed hazardous waste even after treatment and safe disposal, unless delisted pursuant
to 40 CFR 260.20 and 260.22. Other than levels at which wastes typically are delisted, there is no target for a generator
to shoot for which would allow their waste to be considered non-hazardous even if waste minimization actions are taken
that ensure the waste is not likely to pose a hazard to human health and the environment. However, if a waste minimization-based
exemption to the listing could be provided, generators would have the regulatory and economic incentive to meet the
exemption. When the exemption is tailored to encourage and reward waste minimization efforts, then the generator
could obtain the benefit of not generating a listed hazardous waste while furthering national waste minimization
goals.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency notes that there are several important considerations in developing listing determinations that encourage
waste minimization. First, waste minimization-based listings must promote actual waste minimization and clearly
not increase risk. In addition, the listings must be enforceable.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Actual Waste Minimization Must Occur. The Agency is interested in taking comment on developing listings that encourage
reductions in volumes, reductions in concentrations of constituents of concern (without diluting constituents
in an effort to reduce concentration), reductions in environmental loading of constituents of concern, and/or the
removal of constituents of concern (or process derivatives of concern) from the manufacturing process, and/or the
beneficial reuse, recycling, or reclamation of the wastestreams themselves, provided human health and the environment
is protected. A waste minimization-based listing, for example, must be crafted so as not to result simply in cross-media
transfer, and so as not to leave uncontrolled wastes reduced in volume or concentration, but still posing a significant
hazard. The Agency believes that generators must make a commitment that waste minimization in fact would occur, and
that a real investment in waste minimization techniques, equipment, and process changes would be carried out.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. No Increase in Risk Can Occur. A waste minimization-based listing (or variable level) must protect human health
and the environment and not increase risk. A hazardous waste listing achieves the goal of minimizing risk by placing
a wastestream in the hazardous waste management system. Any exemption which takes a wastestream out of this system
must be shown to provide an equivalent decrease in risk as that provided by the listing itself. It would be unacceptable,
for example, for waste minimization actions simply to result in cross-media transfer of wastes. Chemical substitution
that fails to reduce the risks posed by a wastestream is another example of a practice that would not be considered to
be waste minimization. Another specific concern involves the possible presence of other constituents in a wastestream
for which the waste was not specifically listed but which also may pose risk to human health or the environment. A waste
minimization-based listing must consider the impact of letting the entire wastestream out of the hazardous waste
management system.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Enforceability. The Agency is particularly concerned about the enforceability of waste minimization-based
variance to a listing. In particular, the Agency has concerns about the following factors:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The amount of testing or monitoring required,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Ease by which a State inspector could check compliance,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;How a generator would demonstrate compliance with the waste minimization-based exemption,
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The likelihood that a State agency would adopt a waste minimization approach in its listing regulations, and
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The ability of a State agency to oversee an exemption.

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Any waste minimization-based listing must account for these concerns. (Many of these issues now are being considered
in EPA's deliberations on the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule.)

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency can and has used different regulatory mechanisms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to promote waste minimization in the listing program. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discussion below will describe several options the Agency has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified as an approach to tailoring listings that encourages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generators to use waste minimization practices. This approach 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
could apply to any listing determination. Also included in this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A potential method of structuring a waste listing to promote 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste minimization would be to establish a quantity-based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exemption for the wastes listed. Under such an approach, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing of a specific wastestream would be accompanied by a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity-based exemption for the specific wastestream involved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Quantity can refer to either a concentration of constituents in a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste (measured or calculated) or the mass of constituents 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
released to the environment. The Agency believes that this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
approach would encourage waste minimization because a facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would have to meet a risk-based quantitation target for a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestream in order to qualify for the exemption, thereby 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requiring reductions in the mass or concentration (or both) of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the constituents of concern. In reducing mass loading or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentration (or both) of the wastes, the Agency's waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
minimization goals are achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A concentration basis is easier to measure and track than a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limit based on loading or mass. Setting a limit based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
loadings or mass addresses total loadings to the environment and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
recognizes waste minimization efforts that result in reductions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in both mass of pollutant and volume of total wastestream. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, a mass loading approach poses significantly more burden 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in terms of monitoring and compliance and may not take into 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
account concentrations of constituents in a waste. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comment on the use of production or mass-based limits, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and on possible monitoring approaches. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A variation on this approach is an adaptation of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``headworks rule'' (40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iv)(A)&hyph;(E)) to a listing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The original rule, promulgated on November 17, 1981 (46 FR 56582) 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
allows for calculated amounts of certain spent solvents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial chemical products, petroleum refining wastes, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
laboratory residuals to be sent to a facility's wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment plant, and for the wastewaters and sludges (beyond the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
headworks) to be exempted from the mixture rule. The Agency also 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed in the March 1, 1994 carbamates listing proposal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(59 FR 9808&hyph;9864) to provide a similar exemption to a wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed for listing in the same notice. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the ``headworks'' exemption approach (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
261.3(a)(2)(iv)(H)), the wastewaters and treatment sludges would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be exempt from the listing as long as the industry could show 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that the total quantity of hazardous constituents that pose risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
in a wastestream, divided by the undiluted wastewater flow for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters on an average weekly basis from the particular 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product process subject to the listing was less than a calculated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity. The calculated quantity would be based on a risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assessment. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency would have to be able to determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship between the amount of raw material used and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
presence of particular constituents in the wastestream. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency requests comment on whether determining such a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
relationship is feasible for the dye and pigment industries. To 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
qualify for such an exemption, the facility would have to use 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
existing inventory records of raw materials that go into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process. The facility can subtract the quantity of materials 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that, in fact, do not go into the wastewater treatment system, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
either by chemical reaction or material recovery techniques 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
distillation, reuse, reverse osmosis, etc.). The facility 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
may not subtract any quantity assumed to volatilize. The 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantity of material left then would be converted to resulting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
levels of constituents expected to be generated based on quantity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of raw material used. The levels of constituents then would be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
divided by the average weekly flow of the wastewaters into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
headworks of the wastewater treatment system at the time the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
process is being run to determine total concentrations of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents in wastewater. If the total concentration of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constituents of concern is less than the amount calculated based 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on the risk assessment, the wastewaters and treatment sludges 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
would qualify for the exemption. This approach has the advantage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of determining concentrations in a mathematical, rather than an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
analytical way. The disadvantage is that it requires collection 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of process flow data and specific plant chemistry information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency realizes that constituent loading into the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater treatment system may have to be reduced significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(up to two to three orders of magnitude in many cases) in order 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to qualify for an exemption of this sort. Therefore, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
solicits comment on whether such levels are achievable, and what 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other calculation methods may exist (such as one based on 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production mass). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Such an exemption would apply only after the wastewaters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have arrived at the headworks of a facility's wastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment system. The Agency would not allow it to apply to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters before they reach the headworks. Generators who wish 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to qualify for such an exemption would be required to use flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
statistics for the period in which the processes generating the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters are being run. Finally, such an exemption would 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
apply only to wastewater flow for that wastestream, not to flow 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
figures from unrelated processes that serve only to dilute the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, generators would be required to keep records of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
average weekly flow in the production processes, especially when 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the processes generating the listed wastewaters are run. When 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
land disposal restrictions are applied to a waste subject to such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an exemption, generators would need to comply with 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
40 CFR 268.7(a)(6), which states that the generator who has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
produced a waste subject to an exemption in 40 CFR 261.2&hyph;261.6 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must keep a notification in the facility's file stating that such 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
a waste has been generated, the fact that it is restricted, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the disposition of the waste.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency seeks comment on the recordkeeping burden that accompanies its implementation. The Agency realizes that
facilities that would wish to take advantage of such an exemption would be required to allow compliance personnel
to examine process records (reaction rates, reactants, process flows, etc.) to verify that a facility is able to achieve
the exemption. Therefore, the Agency solicits comments on this topic as well.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A quantity-based exemption in a listing determination bears a strong relationship to another ongoing Agency project
which seeks to establish an exit from the hazardous waste management program. The Hazardous Waste Identification
Rule (HWIR) project is an effort, in part, to set exit criteria for any listed hazardous waste so that materials which
clearly fail to pose a threat to human health and the environment can exit the Subtitle C system. The HWIR concept, as
currently envisioned, would be expected to be similar to that of a quantity-based exemption for a specific listed
hazardous waste: a risk- based exemption process that employs analysis of multiple exposure pathways to determine
a safe exit or exemption level. A principal difference between the HWIR concept under discussion and a quantity-based
listing could be that HWIR is meant to apply to all listed wastestreams, while a quantity-based listing could be targeted
to a specific wastestream in a listing determination. In that sense, a listing exemption could be considered to be
more tailored to the known exposure routes of a specific wastestream and may be able to generate an exemption level
which is specific to that wastestream. For example, if the listing determination analysis shows a wastestream in
a listing can be managed only in tanks, then the exemption analysis could be focused on the exposure pathways affected
only by tanks. The exemption levels for that wastestream could be tailored to those exposure routes (air pathways)
and could be different than HWIR exit criteria. The Agency solicits comment on the advantages and disadvantages of
a quantity-based exemption in listing determinations to a more generic exit level lkie that being contemplated in
the HWIR project discussions.

Relationship to the Definition of Solid Waste

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Agency has observed in the dye and pigment and other industries that material recovery may be discouraged due to
restrictions placed on materials designated as ``solid and then hazardous'' waste, as defined by RCRA. Over the past
two years, the Agency's Definition of Solid Waste Task Force in the Office of Solid Waste examined possible modifications
to the definition of solid waste to encourage environmentally sound recycling. A final report of the Task Force was
issued on September 19, 1994.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An example in the dye and pigment industries of using as a product a material that ordinarily would be a waste involves
the blending and sale of collected dusts and fines as inexpensive black pigments useful to shoe polish manufacturers.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The dye and pigment industries have expended considerable effort to cooperate with the Agency on a voluntary waste
minimization program, coordinated through ETAD. As part of this effort, waste minimization, recycle, and reuse
practices in the dye and pigment industries were described for all aspects of production in the ``Pollution Prevention
Guidance Manual for the Dye Manufacturing Industry'' (EPA/741/B&hyph;92&hyph;001).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency is interested in options to modify today's proposed listing determinations to support and enhance the
voluntary waste minimization efforts already initiated by the dye and pigment industries. The Agency requests comment
on the feasibility of the waste minimization-based listing approaches described above for the dye and pigment industries.
EPA also solicits ideas and comments on other possible approaches to tailor the hazardous waste listings and promote
waste minimization in the dye and pigment industries. In particular, the Agency requests comment on other approaches
that may provide more flexibility for waste minimization and better assure that constituent reductions would be
achieved through waste minimization (rather than through treatment).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA specifically requests comment on the feasibility of developing the quantity-based listing approach described
above for the dye and pigment industries. The quantity-based approach is based on the Agency's experience with other
industries in which production is continuous. Because of the batch nature of production and the multiplicity of chemicals
involved in the dye and pigment industries, the quantity-based listing approach may be more difficult for this industry.
The Agency requests comment on how these issues (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
batch processes, multiple chemicals) might be addressed in a quantity-based listing approach or other waste minimization-based
option.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency also solicits comment on whether certain of the dye and pigment wastestreams are better candidates for
waste minimization, and whether a waste minimization-based listing approach should target these wastes. Finally,
EPA requests comment on the testing and monitoring needed to ensure proper implementation of a waste minimization
listing approach. Based on the comments the Agency receives on the above issues, EPA may issue a supplemental proposal
addressing a waste minimization-based listing approach for the dyes and pigments industry.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
RCRA requires EPA to make a land disposal prohibition determination for any hazardous waste that is newly identified
or listed in 40 CFR part 261 after November 8, 1984, within six months of the date of identification or final listing
(RCRA Section 3004(g)(4), 42 U.S.C. 6924(g)(4)). EPA also is required to set ``*&blank;*&blank;* levels or methods
of treatment, if any, which substantially diminish the toxicity of the waste or substantially reduce the likelihood
of migration of hazardous constituents from the waste so that short-term and long-term threats to human health and
the environment are minimized'' (RCRA Section 3004(m)(1), 42 U.S.C. 6924(m)(1)). Land disposal of wastes that meet
treatment standards thus established by EPA is not prohibited. The wastes being proposed for listing in this action
would be subject to this requirement once a final rule is promulgated.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A general overview of the Agency's approach in performing analysis of how to develop treatment standards for hazardous
wastes can be found in greater detail in Section III.A.1 of the preamble to the final rule that set land disposal restrictions
(LDR's) for the Third Third wastes (55 FR 22535, June 1, 1990). The framework for the development of the entire Land
Disposal Restrictions program was promulgated November 7, 1986. (51 FR 40572).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the Agency prefers source reduction/pollution prevention and recycling/recovery over conventional treatment,
inevitably, some wastes (such as residues from recycling and inadvertent spill residues) will be generated. Thus,
standards based on treatment using ``best demonstrated available technology'' (BDAT) will be required to be developed
for these wastes if a final rule listing them as hazardous is promulgated.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Treatment standards typically are established based on the performance data from the treatment of the listed waste
or wastes with similar chemical and physical characteristics or similar concentrations of hazardous constituents.
Treatment standards are established for both wastewater and nonwastewater forms on a constituent-specific basis.
The constituents selected for regulation under the Land Disposal Restrictions Program are not necessarily limited
to those identified as present in the listings proposed in this action, but include those constituents or parameters
that will ensure that the technologies are operated properly.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although data on waste characteristics and current management practices for wastes proposed in this action have
been gathered as part of the administrative record for this rule, the Agency has not completed its evaluation of the
usefulness of these data for developing specific treatment standards or assessing the capacity to treat (or recycle)
these wastes.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Some treatment technologies previously promulgated for newly identified hazardous organic wastes are: chemical
oxidation, wet air oxidation, activated sludge, steam stripping, activated carbon, solvent extraction, pyrolysis,
thermal desorption, UV photolysis, ozonation, and incineration. A current description of these technologies and
what types of wastes they are used to treat is available as a background document and can be obtained by contacting NTIS
(National Technical Information Service, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161, (703)487&hyph;4650) and
requesting document PB91&hyph;160556, ``Treatment Technology Document,'' L. Rosengrant, dated January, 1991,

EPA intends to propose treatment standards for K162 through 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
K166 in a separate rulemaking. However, EPA specifically is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soliciting comment and data on the following as they pertain to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the proposed listing of dye and pigment industries wastes K162 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
through K166 as described in this action:

might be available or anticipated as applicable; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Performance data for the treatment of these or similar

B. Request for Comment on the Agency's Approach to the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Capacity Analyses in the LDR Program 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In the land disposal restrictions determinations, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
must demonstrate that adequate treatment or recovery capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
exists to manage a newly listed waste with BDAT standards before 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
it can restrict the waste from further land disposal. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performs capacity analyses to determine if sufficient alternative 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment or recovery capacity exists to accommodate the volumes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of waste that will be affected by the land disposal prohibition. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If adequate capacity exists, the waste must be treated to meet 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the BDAT standard before land disposal. If adequate capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
does not exist, RCRA Section 3004(h) authorizes EPA to grant a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
national capacity variance from the effective date of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment standard for the waste for up to two years or until 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
adequate alternative treatment capacity becomes available, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
whichever is sooner. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To perform capacity analyses, the Agency needs to determine 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the volume of the listed waste that will require treatment prior 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to land disposal. The volume of waste requiring treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
depends, in turn, on the waste management practices employed by 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the listed waste generators. Data on waste management practices 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for these wastes were collected during the development of this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
proposed rule. However, as the regulatory process proceeds, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
generators may decide to minimize or recycle their wastes or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
otherwise alter their management practices. Thus, EPA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
update and monitor changes in management practices because these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
changes will affect the final volume of waste requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial treatment capacity. Therefore, EPA needs information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on current and future waste management practices for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes, including the volume of waste that are recycled, mixed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with or co-managed with other waste and discharged under Clean 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Water Act provisions; and the volume and types of residuals that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are generated by various management practices applicable to newly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listed and identified wastes (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, treatment residuals).

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The availability of commercial treatment capacity for these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastes determines whether or not a waste is granted a capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
variance under RCRA Section 3004(h). EPA continues to update and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
monitor changes in available commercial treatment capacity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the commercial hazardous waste management industry is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
extremely dynamic. For example, national commercial treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity changes as new facilities come on-line, as new units and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
new technologies are added at existing facilities, and as 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities expand existing units. The available capacity at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial facilities also changes as facilities change their 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
commercial status (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

, changing from a fully commercial to a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
limited commercial or captive facility). To determine the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
availability of capacity for treating these wastes, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
needs to consider currently available data, as well as the timing 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of any future changes in available capacity. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For previous land disposal restriction rules, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
performed capacity analyses using data from national surveys, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
including the 1987 National Survey of Hazardous Waste Treatment, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Storage, Disposal, and Recycling Facilities (the TSDR Survey) and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 1987 National Survey of Hazardous Waste Generators (the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Generator Survey). However, these surveys cannot be used to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
determine the volumes of dye and pigment wastes requiring 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment since these wastes were not included in the surveys. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Additionally, these surveys may not contain adequate information 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on currently available capacity to treat newly identified wastes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
because the data reflect 1986 capacity and do not include 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility expansions or closures that have occurred since then. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Although adjustments have been made to commercially available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity to account for changes in waste management through 1992, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
this was not done on a consistent basis across all waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management practices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA gathered data on waste generation, characteristics and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management practices for the listing determination of dye and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigment wastes in the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire of 1991. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency has compiled the capacity-related information from the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
survey responses and is soliciting any updated or additional 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pertinent information. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To perform the necessary capacity analyses in the land 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal restrictions rulemaking, the Agency needs reliable data 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
on current waste generation, waste management practices, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
available alternative treatment capacity, and planned treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
capacity. The Agency will need the annual generation volumes of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste by each waste code including wastewater and nonwastewater 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
forms, and soil or debris contaminated with these wastes and the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantities stored, treated, recycled, or disposed due to any 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
change of management practices. EPA also requests data from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities capable of treating these wastes on their current 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
treatment capacity and any plans they may have in the future to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
expand or reduce existing capacity. Specifically, the Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests information on the determining factors involved in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
making decisions to build new treatment capacity. Waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
characteristics such as pH level, BTUs, anionic character, total 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
organic carbon content, constituents concentration, and physical 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
form also may limit the availability of certain treatment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
technologies. For these reasons, the Agency requests data and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
comments on waste characteristics that might limit or preclude 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the use of any treatment technologies.

V. Compliance Dates 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under RCRA Section 3010, any person generating, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
transporting, or managing a hazardous waste must notify EPA (or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an authorized State) of its activities. Section 3010(a) allows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA to waive, under certain circumstances, the notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement under Section 3010 of RCRA. If these hazardous waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listings are promulgated, EPA is proposing to waive the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification requirement as unnecessary for persons already 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identified within the hazardous waste management universe (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
persons who have an EPA identification number under 40 CFR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
262.12). EPA is not proposing to waive the notification 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirement for waste handlers who have neither notified the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Agency that they may manage hazardous wastes nor received an EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identification number. Such individuals will have to provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
notification under RCRA Section 3010. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

B. Interim Status and Permitted Facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because HSWA requirements are applicable in authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States at the same time as in unauthorized States, EPA will 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulate EPA Hazardous Wastes Nos. K162 through K166 until States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
are authorized to regulate these wastes. Thus, once this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation becomes effective as a final rule, EPA will apply 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal regulations to these wastes and to their management in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
both authorized and unauthorized States. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

VI. State Authority

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Applicability of Rule in Authorized States 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 3006 of RCRA, EPA may authorize qualified 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States to administer and enforce the RCRA program within the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State. (See 40 CFR part 271 for the standards and requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
for authorization.) Following authorization, EPA retains 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
enforcement authority under Sections 3007, 3008, 3013, and 7003 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of RCRA, although authorized States have primary enforcement 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
responsibility. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(HSWA) amended RCRA, a State with final authorization 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
administered its hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements no 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
longer applied in the authorized State, and EPA could not issue 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permits for any facilities located in the State with permitting 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
authorization. When new, more stringent Federal requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
were promulgated or enacted, the State was obligated to enact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
equivalent authority within specified time-frames. New Federal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requirements did not take effect in an authorized State until the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
State adopted the requirements as State law.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By contrast, under Section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by the HSWA
(including the hazardous waste listings proposed in this notice) take effect in authorized States at the same time
that they take effect in non-authorized States. EPA is directed to implement those requirements and prohibitions
in authorized States, including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorization to do so. While
States still must adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain final authorization, the Federal HSWA requirements
apply in authorized 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States in the interim. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Effect on State Authorizations 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Because this proposal (with the exception of the actions proposed under CERCLA authority) will be promulgated pursuant
to the HSWA, a State submitting a program modification is able to apply to receive either interim or final authorization
under Section 3006(g)(2) or 3006(b), respectively, on the basis of requirements that are substantially equivalent
or equivalent to EPA's requirements. The procedures and schedule for State program modifications under Section
3006(b) are described in 40 CFR 271.21. It should be noted that all HSWA interim authorizations currently are scheduled
to expire on January 1, 2003 (see 57 FR 60129, February 18, 1992). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 271.21(e)(2) of EPA's state authorization regulations (40 CFR part 271) requires that States with final
authorization modify their programs to reflect Federal program changes and submit the modifications to EPA for approval.
The deadline by which the States must modify their programs to adopt this proposed regulation, if it is adopted as a
final rule, will be determined by the date of promulgation of a final rule in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(e)(2). If
the proposal is adopted as a final rule, Table 1 at 40 CFR 271.1 will be amended accordingly. Once EPA approves the modification,
the State requirements become RCRA Subtitle C requirements. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
States with authorized RCRA programs already may have regulations similar to those in this proposed rule. These State
regulations have not been assessed against the Federal regulations being proposed to determine whether they meet
the tests for authorization. Thus, a State would not be authorized to implement these regulations as RCRA requirements
until State program modifications are submitted to EPA and approved, pursuant to 40 CFR 271.21. Of course, States
with existing regulations that are more stringent than or broader in scope than current Federal regulations may continue
to administer and enforce their regulations as a matter of State law. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It should be noted that authorized States are required to modify their programs only when EPA promulgates Federal
standards that are more stringent or broader in scope than existing Federal standards. Section 3009 of RCRA allows
States to impose standards more stringent than those in the Federal program. For those Federal program changes that
are less stringent or reduce the scope of the Federal program, States are not required to modify their programs. See
40 CFR 271.21(e). This proposed rule, if promulgated, would expand the scope of the Federal program by adding additional
listed wastes. Therefore, States would be required to modify their programs to retain authorization to implement
and enforce these regulations.

VII. CERCLA Designation and Reportable Quantities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
All hazardous wastes listed under RCRA and codified in 40 CFR 261.31 through 261.33, as well as any solid waste that
exhibits one or more of the characteristics of a RCRA hazardous waste (as defined in Sections 261.21 through 261.24),
are hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980
(CERCLA), as amended. See CERCLA Section 101(14)(C). CERCLA hazardous substances are listed in Table 302.4 at 40
CFR 302.4 along with their reportable quantities (RQs). RQs are the minimum quantity of a hazardous substance that,
if released, must be reported to the National Response Center (NRC) pursuant to CERCLA Section 103. In this action,
the Agency is proposing to list the proposed wastes in this action as CERCLA hazardous substances in Table 302.4 of
40 CFR 302.4, but is taking no action to adjust the one-pound statutory RQs for these substances. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Reporting Requirements. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Section 102(b) of CERCLA, all hazardous substances newly designated under CERCLA will have a statutory RQ of
one pound unless and until adjusted by regulation. Under CERCLA Section 103(a), the person in charge of a vessel or
facility from which a hazardous substance has been released in a quantity that is equal to or exceeds its RQ immediately
shall notify the NRC of the release as soon as that person has knowledge thereof. The toll-free number of the NRC is 1&hyph;800&hyph;424&hyph;8802;
in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, the number is (202) 426&hyph;2675. In addition to this reporting requirement
under CERCLA, Section 304 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA) requires owners
or operators of certain facilities to report the release of a CERCLA hazardous substance to State and local authorities.
Immediately after the release of a RQ or more, EPCRA Section 304 notification must be given to the community emergency
coordinator of the local emergency planning committee for each area likely to be affected by the release, and to the
State emergency response commission of any State likely to be affected by the release. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If this proposal is promulgated as a final rule, releases equal to or greater than the one-pound statutory RQ will be
subject to the requirements described above, unless and until the Agency adjusts the RQs for these substances in a
future rulemaking.

VIII. Economic Impact Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section of the preamble summarizes the costs and benefits of the dye and pigment hazardous waste listings. Based
upon the EIA, the Agency estimates that the listing of the five dye and pigment production wastes discussed above may
result in nationwide, pre-tax, annualized costs of approximately $18.1 million for compliance in commercial Subtitle
C landfills. The possible future costs of this listing including compliance with land disposal restrictions (LDRs)
range from $20.3 to $70.7 million per year. The $70.7 million represents off-site incineration of non-wastewaters,
while the $20.3 million assumes facilities with large non-wastewater waste volumes will construct on-site incinerators.
A complete discussion of the EIA is available in the regulatory docket entitled ``Costs and Economic Impact Analysis
of Listing Hazardous Wastes from the Organic Dye and Pigment Industries,'' November 28, 1994.

A. Compliance Costs for Listings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The remainder of this section briefly describes (1) the universe of dye and pigment production facilities and volumes
of the seven dye and pigment production wastes proposed to be listed, (2) the methodology for determining incremental
cost and economic impacts to regulated entities, (3) the potential remedial action costs, and (4) economic impacts.
Results of the analysis are summarized in Table VIII&hyph;1.

1. Universe of Dye and Pigment Production Facilities and Waste Volumes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In order to estimate costs for the EIA, it first was necessary to estimate the total annual generation of dye and pigment
production wastes affected by this action. As described in Section II.B of this preamble, the portion of the dye and
pigment industry producing products affected by this listing is composed of 33 manufacturers operating 49 facilities
producing dyes and pigments. In 1992, U.S. sales of all organic dyes and pigments totalled 403 million lbs., with a
value of $1,691 million. Total annual product volumes and waste quantities generated by these affected facilities
were derived from a 1991 survey of the dye and pigment production industries. The production volume and, hence, waste
volume for dyes and pigments varies year to year depending on which colors are popular. A season in which dark colors
are in fashion will produce higher volumes of waste; it is not known which colors were predominant in the study year.

2. Method for Determining Cost and Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
This section details EPA's approach for estimating the incremental compliance cost and the economic impacts attributable
to the listing of dye and pigment production wastes. Because the dye and pigment production industries are moderately
small (33 manufacturers currently operating 49 facilities), EPA was able to collect facility-specific information
and estimate incremental costs at the wastestream level. For ten of the 49 facilities, however, some of the waste generation
data were missing. In these cases, waste generation amounts were estimated. The information used in this analysis
was collected in 1992 through RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaires, engineering site visits, and sampling and analysis
of wastestreams. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

Approach to the Cost Analysis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
EPA's approach to the cost analysis for this rule was to compare the cost of current management practices, as reported
in the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire by dye and pigment production facilities, with the projected cost of management
to comply with the RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste program. An additional analysis included the future cost to the
industry of complying with land disposal restrictions. This difference in cost, when annualized,
<FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>
 represents the incremental annual compliance costs attributable to the rule.

Baseline or Current Management Scenario 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Relying on survey responses and engineering site visits, EPA was able to determine the current (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 1991) management practices for the handling and disposal of dye and pigment production wastes. Current management
practices varied among facilities and wastestreams, and included such practices as on-site monofilling, off-site
incineration, on-site destruction in boilers, and off-site landfilling in municipal, industrial or Subtitle C
landfills. These current management practices at each facility represent the baseline scenario of the analysis.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As part of the survey, EPA asked each facility to identify current costs for the management of dye and pigment production
wastes. For this analysis, EPA relied on the industry's own waste-specific estimates concerning the cost of current
management. EPA realizes that future events, such as waste minimization efforts, may change waste generation volumes
and, thus, future waste management costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Post-Regulatory Management Scenarios 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In estimating the cost of compliance with the listing of dye and pigment production wastes as RCRA hazardous wastes,
EPA assessed the potential waste management on the part of industry to the listing and also assessed the management
cost in response to LDRs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Initial waste management, excluding land disposal restrictions, assumes all non-wastewaters will be sent to off-site
Subtitle C landfills. Wastewaters are assumed to be handled in tanks, at an estimated cost of $18.1 million/yr. It
is important to note that 81 to 95 percent of the total, annual, incremental compliance costs result from listing the
non-wastewaters. The non-wastewaters comprise less than one percent of the quantity of the affected wastes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There were two possible management strategies examined for the dye and pigment industries following the promulgation
of LDRs. The first strategy, the higher-cost response, is waste management, including land disposal restrictions,
with all non-wastewaters being sent to off-site incinerators. Wastewaters are assumed to be handled in newly-constructed
treatment impoundments, which makes this strategy an upper-bound estimate ($70.7 million/yr) because the other
option for wastewaters, handling in tanks, is marginally less expensive.

<!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The second strategy for waste management assumes facilities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with high waste volumes will construct on-site incinerators in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
which to treat their non-wastewaters, with the remaining 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities sending their wastes to off-site incinerators ($20.3 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
million/yr). Wastewaters are assumed to be handled in newly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
constructed treatment impoundments. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

3. Potential Remedial Action Costs 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In addition to dye and pigment production wastes, this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing can affect the management of soils, ground water, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
other remedial materials. The Agency's ``contained in'' policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
defines certain remediation wastes ``containing'' a listed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
hazardous waste as a RCRA hazardous waste. It is possible that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
areas of past dye and pigment waste management, spills, or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disposal, which met the proposed listing description at the time 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
they were placed on the land, still may have contaminant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
concentrations which exceed ``contained in'' levels. A person who 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
disturbs such material can become a generator of RCRA hazardous 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste. The likelihood of this imposing an additional burden is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
moderate because at least 9 of the 49 dye and pigment production 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities already are permitted TSDFs. Releases from all solid 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste management units at these TSDFs, including those that in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the future may be found to contain a waste meeting the dye and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
pigment listing descriptions, already are covered by facility-wide clean-up rules under 40 CFR 264.101. This issue
will be 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
more likely to arise from historical off-site management at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities that were not TSDFs. The pre-tax, incremental cost of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
corrective action liabilities has been estimated at less than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
$8.8 million.

4. Economic Impacts 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
The following economic impacts potentially are 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
overestimated
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a result of inconsistencies in the reporting in the RCRA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 3007 Questionnaire responses. Some facilities were found 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to have reported production quantities on a pure product basis 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
while reporting the average selling price per pound on a dilute 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product basis. This results in an underestimation of revenues, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
as a result of reduced production volumes, and an overestimation 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of economic impacts. In addition, some of the volume of several 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the wastestreams is for co-managed wastes. The values of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
production for the co-generated products were not available and, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
thus, further underestimated revenues which resulted in 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
overestimated economic impacts. Economic impacts were evaluated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
based on incremental, annualized compliance costs discounted at 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
an after-tax rate of 7 percent over a 20-year period. Of the 49 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities 9 facilities may incur potential ``significant economic 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts'' (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, bear compliance costs that would require product 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
cost increases of at least 5 percent) with one of these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities facing product-line discontinuation. Sixteen of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
49 facilities are estimated to incur potential significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
impacts assuming possible future costs for the high-cost LDR 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
alternative. Economic ratios indicate potential closure or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
product-line discontinuation for 4 of the 16 significantly 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected facilities. Under the low-cost LDR alternative, 15 of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the 49 facilities are estimated to incur potential significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impacts. Two of the 15 significantly affected 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facilities are estimated to incur closure or product-line 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
discontinuation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
5. Benefits of Listings 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One objective of a population analysis is to estimate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
number of cancer cases that could be avoided as a result of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
implementation of the proposed rule. People drinking 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated water from residential wells located near the source 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of contamination, people eating home-grown vegetables 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated by blowing dust or vapors, and people breathing air 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated by a disposal unit are the potentially exposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population for this rule. The Agency did not estimate the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
population risks from current practices or the incremental risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
reduction from future actions as a result of the proposed 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
regulation; however, preliminary analysis suggests that the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
incremental risk in terms of cancer cases avoided is expected to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
be near zero. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
One benefit associated with this rulemaking is to place 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastestreams the Agency has determined could pose a risk to human 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
health and the environment into the hazardous waste management 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
system. When wastestreams are placed in this system, the risk 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with their disposal is minimized by the requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of this system. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Agency, however, has historical information that shows 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
damage to ground water and other sensitive environments has 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
occurred during the management of wastes from the dye and pigment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
manufacturing operations. At ten dye and pigment facilities, the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quality of ground water has been adversely affected by waste 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
management activities, typically unlined waste trenches, aeration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
basins, and impoundments. One dye company had to purchase the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
deeds to three nearby residences and a gas station because VOC-contaminated ground water originating from the plant
had 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
contaminated surrounding drinking water wells. At another dye 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility, a contaminated ground-water plume migrated under 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
residential houses bordering the site. The residential wells, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
used for swimming pools and irrigation systems in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
neighborhood, were condemned because of chemical contamination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Ground water was contaminated from land treatment of dye 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewater being sprayed onto a field, and passing through a 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
layer of clay. Soil contamination near drum storage pads or drum 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wash areas has been documented at 7 dye facilities. As a result, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the leachate from these soils possibly contributed to the ground- 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
water contamination associated with many of the sites. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Concentrations of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
have been found in soils surrounding an on-site landfill at a dye 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
facility. Finally, dye and pigment facilities are found on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Superfund National Priority List; further evidence that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
mismanagement of dye and pigment wastes have the potential to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
yield threats of concern to human health. In summary, although 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
difficult to quantify precisely, a benefit of today's proposal is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
the prevention of additional or similar incidents occurring from 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
similar management practices of dye and pigment wastes that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
potentially could degrade the quality of ground water or other 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
sensitive natural resources. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to the reduction of human health risk associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
with the mismanagement of dye and pigment wastes proposed for 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing in this rulemaking, there are a number of other benefits 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
that are even more difficult to quantify. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Subtitle C management framework for generators and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
permitted treatment storage and disposal facilities establishes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
standards for hazardous waste handling, management, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
remediation that: Reduce ecological risks, reduce natural 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
resource damage, reduce the likelihood and severity of accidents, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
improve worker safety, promote facility-wide remedial programs, 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
insure that adequate financial assurance is established to handle 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
protective closure of waste management units, increase public 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
participation, improve information availability on waste quantity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and movement, ensure minimum uniform national standards, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
create incentives for pollution prevention. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Ecological and Natural Resource Damage Reduction 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The risk assessment for this listing has focused on the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
human health risks associated with plausible management of dye 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
and pigment wastes. An additional concern, given the proximity 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of several facilities to surface waters and their associated 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wetland systems, is the potential for ecological damages to biota 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
inhabiting surface waters and wetlands. In some cases migration 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
to the surface water may be occurring via groundwater. EPA 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
requests comments regarding the potential for ecological damages 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
associated with the wastes proposed for listing in today's 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
rulemaking. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition to direct ecological and human health damage 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
there is evidence from EPA's contaminant fate and transport 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
modelling and case studies of ground water, surface water, and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
soil degradation. While use of and human exposure to these 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural resources may not be occurring now, their use in the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
future could be limited if they are contaminated. The Subtitle C 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste management program will limit future releases and prevent 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
natural resource damages. These benefits have not been 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
quantified.

Reduce the Likelihood and Severity of Accidents
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
An important component of the Subtitle C system for both generators and permitted treatment, storage and disposal
facilities is the need to establish waste analysis plans, contingency plans, emergency procedures, inspection
programs, construction quality assurance and personnel training programs. In addition, permitted facilities
also must have in place inspection programs and location standards. The costs of these programs have been included
in the cost analysis, but the benefits are difficult to quantify. These Subtitle C programs may reduce risk to workers
and nearby populations by reducing the chance of contaminant releases, accidental exposures, and catastrophic
failures. In the event that accidents occur, these Subtitle C provisions increase the likelihood of quick action
and ensure protection of human health and the environment. There are other programs that require similar planning
(
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 OSHA, Section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act) and indirectly affect hazardous waste handling; RCRA regulatory provisions
deal directly with accident prevention standards associated with the handling of hazardous wastes.

Promote Facility-Wide Remedial Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Those facilities that choose to obtain Part B permits for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes
will have the responsibility of ensuring that adequate corrective action programs are in place to control releases
from all solid waste management units. The cost analysis included an evaluation of the cost of facility-wide corrective
action while the risk assessment focused only on the risks associated with hazardous waste management units. Although
difficult to quantify, there are risk-reduction benefits associated with the cleanup of releases from the solid
waste management units in addition to those benefits associated with the handling of listed waste.

Financial Assurance To Insure Protective Closure of Waste Management Units
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Permitted facilities are required to support financial mechanisms which ensure that adequate funds are available
to close hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal units in a manner that ensures long-term protection of human
health and the environment. The costs of those financial assurance requirements have been included in the cost analysis;
however, the benefits are difficult to quantify. Financial assurance has the benefit of insuring that owners and
operators of hazardous waste facilities have sufficient financial resources to close their facilities in an environmentally-protective
manner.

Increase Public Participation and Improve Information Availability
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Subtitle C system has the benefit of providing the information needed to empower local communities and waste managers,
those most affected by and able to improve substandard waste management practices. The public participation provisions
of the Subtitle C system ensure that information is provided to stakeholders regarding the risks to human health and
the environment of a new or expanding waste management facility. Biennial reporting, required of all large quantity
generators of hazardous waste, allows for more informed waste management decisions and capacity management. Finally,
the manifest system, which is used to track the movement of wastes, ensures protective handling of hazardous wastes
as they move in commerce.

IX. Executive Order 12866
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Executive Order 12866 requires that regulatory agencies determine whether a new regulation constitutes a significant
regulatory action. A significant regulatory action is defined as an action likely to result in a rule that may:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely affect in a material way the economy,
a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local,
or tribal governments or communities;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in Executive Order 12866.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
EPA estimated the costs of the proposed listings and evaluated the other factors above to determine if this proposed
rule making would be a major regulation as defined by the Executive Order. Today's proposed rule is estimated to have
an annualized incremental cost of less than $19 million. Based on EPA's analysis of the other factors, today's proposed
rule is considered a significant regulatory action because of the novel policy issues contained herein. As a significant
regulatory action, it has been submitted to and reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.

X. Regulatory Flexibility Act
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires Federal agencies to consider ``small entities'' throughout
the regulatory process. Section 603 of the RFA requires an initial screening analysis to be performed to determine
whether small entities will be affected by the regulation. If affected small entities are identified, regulatory
alternatives that mitigate the potential impacts must be considered. Small entities as described in the Act are only
those ``businesses, organizations and governmental jurisdictions subject to regulation.''

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For SIC 2865, Cyclic Crudes and Intermediates, the Small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Business Administration defines small entities as those firms 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employing less than or equal to 750 employees. Based on this 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
employment cutoff, approximately 61 percent, or 20 of the 33 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
affected dye and/or pigment manufacturers (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 companies) are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considered small entities. Under the listing alternative, which 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
assumes disposal of wastewater treatment sludges/solids in an 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
off-site commercial Subtitle C landfill and management of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
wastewaters in tanks, 7 of the 33 affected companies are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
estimated to incur potential significant economic impacts. Four 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
of the 7 companies estimated to incur potential significant 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impacts are small entities. Although small entities are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
predominant in the affected industry, the proposed listings do 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
not adversely affect small entities to a greater extent than 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
large entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the Agency's Revised Guidelines for Implementing the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Agency is committed to 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
considering regulatory alternatives in rulemakings when there are 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
any estimated economic impacts on small entities. The Agency 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
obtained firm level employment data for the purpose of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
identifying and evaluating economic impacts on small entities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The statutory requirements of the RCRA program do not provide 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
legal avenues to grant relief from the proposed listings to small 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entities. Because of statutory restrictions, the Agency is 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
unable to exempt small entities or develop options to reduce 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
economic impacts on small entities. The Agency must identify 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
waste streams for listing without regard to the size of the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
entity being regulated. However, the possibility of enforceable 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
agreements described previously may ameliorate the impact of 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
listing on small entities.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In response to a request from the U.S. Butt-Weld Fittings Committee, petitioner in this proceeding, the Department
of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on carbon steel
butt-weld pipe fittings from Taiwan. The review covers four manufacturers/exporters of the subject merchandise
to the United States for the period December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We have preliminarily determined that sales have been made below the foreign market value (FMV). If these preliminary
results are adopted in our final results of administrative review, we will instruct U.S. Customs to assess antidumping
duties equal to the difference between the United States price (USP) and FMV. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
On December 17, 1986, the Department published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 (51 FR 45152) the antidumping duty order on carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Taiwan. On November 26, 1993,
the Department published (58 FR 62327) a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review'' of the antidumping
duty order for the period December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993. We received a timely request from the petitioner,
the U.S. Butt-Weld Fittings Committee, to review C.M. Pipe Fitting Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (CM), Rigid Industries
Co., Ltd. (Rigid), Chup Hsin Enterprises (Chup Hsin), and Gei Bey Corporation (Gei Bey). The period of review (POR)
covers December 1, 1992, through November 30, 1993, and the administrative review was initiated on January 18, 1994
(59 FR 2593). The Department is conducting this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended
(the Act). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Scope of the Review 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Imports covered by this review are shipments of carbon steel butt-weld type pipe fittings, other than couplings,
under 14 inches in inside diameter, whether finished or unfinished, that have been formed in the shape of elbows, tees,
reducers, and caps, and if forged, have been advanced after forging. These advancements may include one or more of
the following: coining, heat treatment, shot blasting, grinding, die stamping, or painting. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings are currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) item number
7307.93.3000. The HTS subheading is provided for convenience and for U.S. Customs purposes. The written description
remains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Best Information Available 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, we have preliminarily determined that the use of best information otherwise
available (BIA) is appropriate for certain firms. The Department's regulations provide that we may take into account
whether a party refuses to provide information (19 CFR 353.37(b)). For purposes of these reviews, we have used the
most adverse BIA_generally, the highest rate for any company for this same class or kind of merchandise from this or
any prior segment of the proceeding_whenever a company refused to cooperate with the Department or otherwise significantly
impeded the proceeding. When a company substantially cooperated with our requests for information, but failed to
provide all the information requested in a timely manner or in the form requested, we used as BIA the higher of (1) the
highest rate (including the ``all others'' rate) ever applicable to the firm for the same class or kind of merchandise
from the same country from either the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation or a prior administrative review;
or (2) the highest calculated rate in this review for any firm for the same class or kind of merchandise from the same
country. See

996 F.2d 1185 (Fed. Cir. 1993). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because Chup Hsin and Gei Bey failed to respond to the Department's questionnaire, we have used the highest rate ever
found in this proceeding to establish their margins. This rate is 87.30 percent, which was also used for these two firms
in the LTFV investigation when they failed to respond in that stage of the proceeding.

In calculating USP, the Department treated respondents' sales as purchase price (PP) transactions, as defined in
section 772 of the Act, because the merchandise was sold to unrelated U.S. purchasers prior to importation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 PP was based on c.i.f. U.S. port prices to unrelated purchasers in, or for exportation to, the United States. We made
deductions from PP, as appropriate, for domestic inland freight, brokerage and handling charges, assorted port
and trade development taxes in Taiwan, ocean freight, marine insurance, imputed credit expenses, assorted bank
and interest charges, and commissions.

In order to determine whether there were sufficient sales of carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings in the home market
to serve as a viable basis for calculating FMV, we compared the volume of home market sales of carbon steel butt-weld
pipe fittings to the volume of third country sales, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. CM and Rigid had
viable home markets with respect to sales of carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Because 20 percent of Rigid's foreign market sales were determined to have been made below the cost of production (COP)
during the last administrative review (56 FR 20187, 20188), we concluded that reasonable grounds existed to believe
or suspect that home market sales during the POR were made at prices below COP. Therefore, pursuant to section 773(b)
of the Act, the Department initiated a COP investigation of Rigid for purposes of this administrative review. See

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 9463, 9467 (February 28, 1994). Furthermore, based on an allegation by petitioner, we also determined that reasonable
grounds existed to believe or suspect that sales below cost of carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings had been made by
CM. Thus, we initiated a COP investigation with respect to CM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 We performed a model-specific COP test, in which we examined whether each home market sale was priced below the merchandise's
COP. The Department defines the COP as the sum of direct material, direct labor, variable and fixed factory overhead,
general expenses, and packing. For each model, we compared this sum to the reported home market unit price, net of price
adjustments and movement expenses. In accordance with section 773(b) of the Act, we also examined whether the home
market sales of each model were made at prices below their COP in substantial quantities over an extended period of

 For each model where less than 10 percent, by quantity, of the home market sales during the POR were made at prices below
the COP, we included all sales of that model in the computation of FMV. For each model where 10 percent or more, but not
more than 90 percent, of the home market sales during the POR were priced below the merchandise's COP, we excluded from
the calculation of FMV those home market sales which were priced below the merchandise's COP, provided that these
below-cost sales were made over an extended period of time. For each model where 90 percent or more of the home market
sales during the POR were priced below the COP, we disregarded all sales of that model from our calculation of FMV and
used the constructed value (CV) of those models as described below. See

 In order to determine if sales below cost had been made over an extended period of time, we compared the number of months
in which below-cost sales occurred for each model to the number of months during the POR in which each model was sold.
If a model was sold in fewer than three months, we did not exclude the below-cost sales unless there were below-cost
sales in each month of sale. If a model was sold in three or more months, we did not exclude the below-cost sales unless
there were below-cost sales in at least three months during the POR. See

 58 FR 39729, 39751 (July 26, 1993). Based on this test, we found it necessary to disregard certain home market sales
made by CM and Rigid.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 We used CV as FMV for those U.S. sales for which there were insufficient sales of the comparison home-market model at
or above the COP. We calculated CV, in accordance with section 773(e) of the Act, as the sum of the cost of manufacturing
of the product sold in the United States, home market selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, home
market profit, and U.S. packing. For home market SG&amp;A expenses, we used the larger of the actual SG&amp;A expenses
reported by the respondents or 10 percent of the COM, the statutory minimum for foreign SG&amp;A expenses. For home
market profit, we used the larger of the actual profit reported by the respondents or the statutory minimum of eight
percent of the sum of COM and SG&amp;A expenses. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 For those models that had sufficient above-cost sales, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated customers
in the home market. In calculating FMV, we made adjustments, where appropriate, for inland freight and imputed credit
expenses. We adjusted for the Taiwan consumption tax in accordance with our decision in

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 59 FR 31204 (June 17, 1994). We deducted home market packing costs from the home market price and added U.S. packing
costs to the FMV. Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.56, we also made, where applicable, adjustments for differences in the physical
characteristics of merchandise. Furthermore, where commissions were paid on U.S. sales and not paid on home market
sales, we allowed an offset to FMV amounting to the lesser of the weighted-average home market indirect selling expenses
or the U.S. commissions, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b) of the regulations.

 This notice serves as a preliminary reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate
regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review
period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement
of antidumping duties occurred and subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The merchandise covered by this order is silicomanganese. Silicomanganese, which is sometimes called ferrosilicon
manganese, is a ferroalloy composed principally of manganese, silicon, and iron, and normally containing much smaller
proportions of minor elements, such as carbon, phosphorous and sulfur. Silicomanganese generally contains by weight
not less than four percent iron, more than 30 percent manganese, more than eight percent silicon and not more than three
percent phosphorous. All compositions, forms and sizes of silicomanganese are included within the scope of this
investigation, including silicomanganese slag, fines and briquettes. Silicomanganese is used primarily in steel
production as a source of both silicon and manganese. This investigation covers all silicomanganese, regardless
of its tariff classification. Most silicomanganese is currently classifiable under subheading 7202.30.0000 of
the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Some silicomanganese may also currently be classifiable
under HTSUS subheading 7202.99.5040. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes,
our written description of the scope is dispositive.

in accordance with section 736 of the Act, the Department will direct United States Customs officers to assess, upon
further advice by the administering authority pursuant to section 736(a)(1) of the Act, antidumping duties equal
to the amount by which the foreign market value of the merchandise exceeds the United States price for all entries of
silicomanganese from Brazil. These antidumping duties will be assessed on all unliquidated entries of silicomanganese
from Brazil entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after June 17, 1994, the date on which the Department
published its preliminary determination notice in the

Antidumping Duty Order
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On December 14, 1994, in accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC)
notified the Department that an industry in the United States is threatened with material injury by reason of such
imports. The ITC did not determine, pursuant to section 735(b)(4)(B)of the Act that, but for the suspension of liquidation
of entries of silicomanganese from the PRC, the domestic industry would have been materially injured.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
When the ITC fins threat of material injury, and makes a negative ``but for'' finding, the ``Special Rule'' provision
of section 736(b)(2) applies. Therefore, all unliquidated entries or warehouse withdrawals, for consumption of
silicomanganese from the PRC made on or after December 14, 1994, the date on which the ITC issued its final determination
of threat of material injury, will be liable for the assessment of antidumping duties. The Department will direct
U.S. Customs officers to terminate the suspension of liquidation for entries entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,
for consumption before December 14, 1994, and to release any bond or other security, and refund any cash deposit, posted
to secure the payment of estimated antidumping duties with respect to these entries.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Department will direct U.S. Customs officers to assess, upon further advice by the administering authority pursuant
to section 736(a)(1) of the Act, antidumping duties equal to the amount by which the foreign market value of the merchandise
exceeds the United States price for all entries of silicomanganese from the PRC. These antidumping duties will be
assessed on all unliquidated entries of silicomanganese from the PRC entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption
on or after the date on which the ITC issued its final affirmative determination of threat of material injury. U.S.
Customs officers must require, at the same time as importers would normally deposit estimated duties on this merchandise,
a cash deposit of 150.00 percent

the Department determined that critical circumstances existed for imports of silicomanganese from the PRC, However,
the ITC determined, as required by section 735(b)(4)(A) of the Act, that retroactive imposition of antidumping duties
of the merchandise is not necessary to prevent recurrence of material injury that was caused by massive imports of
the merchandise over a relatively short period of time. Therefore, in accordance with the ITC finding and pursuant
to section 735(c)(3) of the Act, the Department will direct the Customs Service to terminate the retroactive suspension
of liquidation and to release any bond or security, and refund any cash deposit required under section 733(d)(2) of
the Act with respect to entries of silicomanganese, the liquidation of which was suspended retroactively under section
733(e)(2) of the Act.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice constitutes the antidumping duty order with respect to silicomanganese from the PRC, pursuant to section
736(a) of the Act. Interested parties may contact the Central Records Unit, Room B&hyph;099 of the Main Commerce Building,
for copies of an updated list of antidumping duty orders currently in effect.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

Title: Electric Test Structure and Method for Measuring the Relative Locations of Conducting Features on an Insulating
Substrate
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Description: NIST researchers have invented a new electrical test structure to provide measurements of the separations
of conducting features on an insulating substrate with uncertainties typically below 10 nm. Measurement dynamic
repeatability is nominally less than 1 nm. Absolute accuracy has been determined by comparing measurements of the
same feature separations with those made by the NIST line-scale interferometer which has traceability to absolute
length standards.

On September 12, 1994, an application was filed by the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife (FWS) for a modification
to their scientific research and enhancement Permit 747 (P45H). Permit 747 allows FWS to take threatened Sacramento
River winter-run chinook salmon (

) as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531&hyph;543) and the NMFS regulations governing
listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217&hyph;22). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
FWS requested an expansion of their research sampling area to include the lower reaches of the creeks and tributaries
of the Sacramento River in Butte, Glenn, and Tehama Counties in CA. The expanded sampling will occur in the tributaries
within 5 miles of their confluence with the mainstem Sacramento River. In addition, FWS requested authorization
to allow Dr. Paul E. Maslin, Department of Biological Sciences, California State University at Chico and his graduate
students to carry out this expanded sampling and to participate in the part of the research involving the annual collection
and sacrifice of up to 450 adipose fin-clipped and coded-wire tagged juvenile, listed, Sacramento River winter-run
chinook salmon released from the FWS's Coleman National Fish Hatchery. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that on December 6, 1994, as authorized by the provisions of the ESA, NMFS issued Modification
4 to Permit 747 for the above taking, subject to certain conditions set forth therein. This modification will be in
effect for the duration of the permit, which expires on December 31, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issuance of this permit, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such permit: (1) Was applied for in good faith;
(2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is the subject of this permit; (3) is consistent
with the purposes and policies set forth in section 2 of the ESA. This permit was also issued in accordance with and is
subject to parts 217&hyph;222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Notice is hereby given that the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has applied in due form to take listed
species as authorized by the ESA and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
DWR (P578) requests authorization to take juvenile and adult, threatened, Sacramento River winter-run chinook
salmon (

) for scientific research purposes while conducting an acoustic barrier applied research project at the confluence
of Georgiana Slough with the Sacramento River. The purpose of the proposed project is to determine the effectiveness
of an underwater acoustic barrier in diverting migrating juvenile chinook salmon away from Georgiana Slough under
various hydraulic and hydrologic conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated substantially higher mortality
rates for downstream migrating juvenile chinook salmon which pass from the Sacramento River into Georgiana Slough
when compared with salmon which continue their migration downstream within the Sacramento River channel. The proposed
study involves Kodiak trawling within the Sacramento River and Georgiana Slough between February and June 1995 to
determine the guidance efficiency of the barrier.

<DOCTITLE>Partial Record of Decision (PROD) for the Disposal and Reuse Final Environmental Impact Statement for Carswell Air
Force Base (AFB), Texas</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
On November 21, 1994, the Air Force issued a PROD for the disposal of a portion of Carswell Air Force Base (AFB), Texas.
The decisions included in this PROD have been made in consideration of the Carswell AFB Disposal and Reuse Final Environmental
Impact Statement (FEIS), which was filed with the Environmental Protection Agency on February 18, 1994, and other
relevant considerations.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Carswell AFB was officially closed on September 30, 1993, pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act
(DBCRA) of 1990, (Public Law 101&hyph;510) and the recommendations of the Defense Secretary's Commission on Base
Realignment and Closure. This PROD documents the Carswell AFB disposal decisions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Air Force has decided to dispose of the approximately 1946 acres fee and 69.99 acres leased portion of the base in
the following manner: Parcel A (approximately 95.03 acres) will be transferred to the Federal Bureau of Prisons for
the development of a Federal Medical Center Complex, Parcel B (20 houses on approximately 6.68 acres) will be assigned
to Health and Human Services for a Public Benefit Conveyance to ARI for a rehabilitation center, Parcel C (one house
on approximately .23 acres) will be assigned to the Department of Education for a Public Benefit Conveyance to Westworth
Village for use as a public library, Parcel D (approximately 1,840 acres fee and 69.99 acres leased), will be retained
and realigned by the DoD as mandated by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The uses proposed for the property by prospective recipients of property under the ROD are included in the proposed
action in the FEIS and are consistent with the community's draft redevelopment plan for the base. Carswell Redevelopment
Authority prepared the plan, with the assistance of the broader community.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By this decision, the Air Force adopts certain mitigation measures, as described in this PROD, to protect public health
and the environment. In response to existing or forecasted environmental impacts to or in the area of Carswell AFB,
subsequent property owners should consider implementation of the more specific mitigation measures associated
with reuses they may undertake, as set forth in Chapter 4 of the Final Environmental Impact Statement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions regarding this matter should be directed to Mr. Charles R. Hatch, Program Manager, Southwest Division.
Correspondence should be sent to AFBCA/SW, 1700 N. Moore Street, suite 2300, Arlington, VA 22209&hyph;2809.

In accordance with the Federal policy governing the granting of academic degree by Federal agencies (approved by
a letter from the Director, Bureau of the Budget, to the Secretary, Health, Education, and Welfare, dated December
23, 1954), the Secretary is required to establish a review committee to advise the Secretary concerning any legislation
that may be proposed which would authorize the granting of degrees by a Federal agency. The review committee forwards
its recommendation concerning a Federal agency's proposed degree-granting authority to the Secretary, who then
forwards the committee's recommendation and the Secretary's recommendation to the Office of Management and Budget
for review and transmittal to the Congress. The Secretary uses the Advisory Committee as the review committee required
for this purpose. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee will review the following institution:

<DOCTITLE>Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co., Notice of Availability of the Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental

The staffs of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the California State Lands Commission (SLC) have
prepared this draft environmental impact report/environmental impact statement (EIR/EIS) on the natural gas pipeline
facilities proposed by Tuscarora Gas Transmission Company (Tuscarora) in the above docket.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft EIR/IS was prepared to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and the California
Environmental Quality Act. The FERC and SLC believe, subject to public comment, that approval of the proposed project,
with appropriate mitigation measures including receipt of necessary permits and approvals, has the potential to
significantly impact the environment. The draft EIR/EIS evaluates alternatives to the proposal.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft EIR/EIS assesses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of the proposed
Tuscarora Pipeline Project, which includes the following facilities:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;One 229-mile, 20 inch-diameter pipeline between Malin, Oregon and Tracy, Nevada (the Tuscarora mainline).

Take notice that on November 18, 1994, Santee Distributing Company (Santee) filed a complaint against Dixie Pipeline
Company (Dixie) pursuant to section 13(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA). Santee alleges that Dixie's throughput
has increased since 1991 and its current rates in Tariff No. 52 are no longer just and reasonable. Santee states that
the Commission should investigate, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
inter alia,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Dixie's cost of service and throughput in order to derive new rates, and should order a reduction in Dixie's current
rates.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Office of Basic Energy Sciences (BES) of the Office of Energy Research (ER), U.S. Department of Energy, hereby
announces its interest in receiving grant applications to support a continuing program for advanced 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
battery technology research and development focused on batteries for the 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
consumer market. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Batteries and battery-like devices are a mainstay of contemporary electronic, information, and transportation
industries. The performance of batteries is often the limiting factor that hinders the development of improved portable
devices such as cellular telephones, laptop computers, hand held tools, and other consumer products. Stringent
environmental requirements impose restrictions on the use of battery materials and components deemed to be harmful
not only to the environment but also to human well being. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The objective of this effort is to develop new generic battery technology for a wide range of non-automotive uses,
with particular emphasis on improvements in battery size, weight, life, and recharge cycles. The interest is in novel
research and technology development, and not in research leading to incremental improvements in existing devices.
For the purpose of this notice, batteries for transportation and fuel cells are excluded from consideration.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 In accordance with 10 C.F.R. 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order
set out below. The Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has tentatively formulated to
distribute to eligible claimants $3,657.84, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE pursuant to September 30,
1981 and April 27, 1982 Remedial Orders. In the Remedial Orders, the DOE found that, during periods beginning August
1, 1979, the firms each had sold motor gasoline at prices in excess of the maximum lawful selling price, in violation
of Federal petroleum price regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OHA has tentatively determined to distribute the funds obtained from the firms in two stages. In the first stage,
we will accept claims from identifiable purchasers of gasoline from the firms who may have been injured by overcharges.
The specific requirements which an applicant must meet in order to receive a refund are set out in Section III of the
Proposed Decision. Claimants who meet these specific requirements will be eligible to receive refunds based on the
number of gallons of gasoline which they purchased from Ed's Exxon or Ron's Shell. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If any funds remain after valid claims are paid in the first stage, they may be used for indirect restitution in accordance
with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;07.
Applications for Refund should not be filed at this time. Appropriate public notice will be provided prior to the acceptance
of claims. Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting
parties are requested to provide two copies of their submissions. Comments must be submitted within 30 days of publication
of this notice in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 and should be sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. All comments received in this proceeding
will be available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal
holidays, in the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, located in Room 1E&hyph;234, 1000 Independence
Avenue, S.W., Washington, DC 20585.

On July 20, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition
for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), to distribute
the funds received pursuant to Remedial Orders issued by the DOE to Ed's Exxon of Cotati, California, and Ron's Shell
of Danville, California (hereinafter jointly referred to as the remedial order firms). In accordance with the provisions
of the procedural regulations at 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V (Subpart V), the ERA requests in its Petition that the
OHA establish special procedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects of regulatory violations set forth
in the Remedial Order. This Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan to distribute these funds.

I. Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Each of the remedial order firms was a retailer of motor gasoline during the periods relevant to this proceeding. The
ERA issued Proposed Remedial Orders (PROs) to each of the firms.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 The PROs alleged that, during separate periods beginning on August 1, 1979, the remedial order firms had: charged
more than the maximum lawful selling price for one or more grades of gasoline in violation of 10 C.F.R. 212.93; failed
to post and maintain the maximum lawful selling price or a proper certification in violation of 10 C.F.R. 212.129;
failed to keep and maintain books and records to support the lawfulness of the price for gasoline on the audit date in
violation of 10 C.F.R. 210.92 and 212.93; and/or engaged in unlawful or discriminatory business practices in violation
of 10 C.F.R. 210.62.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing
a plan of distribution of funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart
V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion
procedures to distribute refunds,

 We have considered the ERA's petition that we implement Subpart V proceedings with respect to the above remedial order
funds and have determined that such proceedings are appropriate. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the
OHA's tentative plan to distribute these funds. Before taking the actions proposed in this Decision, we intend to
publicize our proposal and solicit comments from interested parties. Comments regarding the tentative distribution
processes set forth in this Proposed Decision and Order should be filed with the OHA within 30 days of its publication
in the

III. Proposed Refund Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
We propose to implement a two-stage refund procedure for distribution of the remedial order funds, by which purchasers
of gasoline from the remedial order firms during the period covered by the Remedial Orders may submit Applications
for Refund in the initial stage. From our experience with Subpart V proceedings, we expect that potential applicants
generally will be limited to ultimate consumers (``end-users''). Therefore, we do not anticipate that it will be
necessary to employ the injury presumptions that we have used in past proceedings in evaluating applications submitted
by refiners, resellers, and retailers.

If a refiner, reseller, or retailer should file an application in any of the refund proceedings, however, we will utilize
the standards and appropriate presumptions established in previous proceedings.

First Stage Refund Procedures.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In order to receive a refund, each claimant will be required to submit a schedule of its monthly purchases of gasoline
from the remedial order firm during the period covered by the Remedial Order. Our experience indicates that the use
of certain presumptions permits claimants to participate in the refund process without incurring inordinate expense
and ensures that refund claims are evaluated in the most efficient manner possible. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Marathon Petroleum Co.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 Presumptions in refund cases are specifically authorized by the applicable Subpart V regulations at 10 C.F.R. &sect;205.282(e).
Accordingly, we propose to adopt the presumptions set forth below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 1. Calculation of Refunds. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
First, we will adopt a presumption that the overcharges were dispersed equally in all of the remedial order firms'
sales of gasoline during the period covered by the Remedial Orders. In accordance with this presumption, refunds
will be made on a pro-rata or volumetric basis.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 In the absence of better information, a volumetric refund is appropriate because the DOE price regulations generally
required a regulated firm to account for increased costs on a firm-wide basis in determining its prices. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 -->
4
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

</FOOTNAME>
<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
If an individual claimant believes that it was injured by more than its volumetric share, it may elect to forego this
presumption and file a refund application based upon a claim that it suffered a disproportionate share of the remedial
firm's overcharges. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
e.g., Mobil Oil Corp./Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad Co.,

Mobil Oil Corp./Marine Corps Exchange Service,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 17 DOE &para;85,714 (1988). Such a claim will only be granted if the claimant makes a persuasive showing that it was
``overcharged'' by a specific amount, and that it absorbed those overcharges. See 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 -->
Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co./Western Petroleum Co.,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->
 19 DOE &para;85,705 (1989). To the degree that a claimant makes this showing, it will receive an above-volumetric
refund. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 </FOOTNOTE>

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under the volumetric approach, a claimant's ``allocable share'' of a Remedial Order fund is equal to the number of
gallons purchased from the remedial order firm during the period covered by that Remedial Order times the per gallon
refund amount.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 We derived the per gallon refund figures by dividing the amount of each Remedial Order fund by the total volume of gasoline
which each remedial order firm sold during the period specified in that Remedial Order. An applicant that establishes
its eligibility for a refund will receive all or a portion of its allocable share plus a pro-rata share of the accrued
interest.

cost of processing claims in which refunds for amounts less than $15 are sought outweighs the benefits of restitution
in those instances. See

2. End-Users. In accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings, we will adopt the presumption that an end-user or ultimate
consumer of gasoline purchased from one of the remedial order firms whose business is unrelated to the petroleum industry
was injured by the overcharges resolved by the Remedial Order. See, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
). Members of this group generally were not subject to price controls during the period covered by the Remedial Order,
and were not required to keep records which justified selling price increases by reference to cost increases. Consequently,
analysis of the impact of the overcharges on the final prices of goods and services produced by members of this group
would be beyond the scope of the refund proceeding.

 End-users of gasoline purchased from the remedial order firms need only document their purchase volumes from the
firm during the period covered by the Remedial Order to make a sufficient showing that they were injured by the overcharges.

the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 4501&hyph;07.
PODRA requires that the Secretary of Energy determine annually the amount of oil overcharge funds that will not be
required to refund monies to injured parties in Subpart V proceedings and make those funds available to state governments
for use in four energy conservation programs. The Secretary has delegated these responsibilities to the OHA, and
any funds in the Remedial Order funds that the OHA determines will not be needed to effect direct restitution to injured
customers will be distributed in accordance with the provisions of PODRA.

 On March 15, 1994, the EPA proposed the list of experienced coke oven inspectors who will serve as panel members during
the certification of coke oven observers
<FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>
. The purpose of proposing and promulgating the list is to set forth the list of experienced coke oven inspectors who
will serve as panel members during the certification of coke oven observers. This action also informed the public
that these people have demonstrated to the Agency that they satisfy the minimum experience requirements, established
in Method 303 of Appendix A of Part 63, and gave the public the opportunity to examine the panel members' qualifications
and to comment. Additional panel members may be added in the future in accordance with implementation needs. Any additions
of certified and qualified inspectors to the panel will be made without promulgation, which was necessary only to
establish this initial panel.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 On October 27, 1993, the EPA promulgated the coke oven National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants,
which limits the number of visible leaks from coke oven doors, topside ports, and offtake systems, and the amount of
time of visible emissions from the charging operation. Also promulgated at that time was Method 303 (40 CFR, part 63,
appendix A), which sets forth the procedures an observer shall follow to determine compliance with the coke oven standards.
In order to implement the coke oven rule, coke oven inspectors must be certified by an EPA recognized panel in accordance
with the procedures set forth in section 2 of Method 303. The Method 303 certification training for each trainee concludes
with a determination by a three-member panel as to the trainee's ability to conduct Method 303 satisfactorily. The
Agency developed a certification course for coke oven inspectors and, as part of this effort, the Agency selected
a group of experienced individuals to act as panel members. With today's action, the Agency finalizes an initial list
of experienced coke oven inspectors who will serve as panel members during the certification of coke oven observers.
Additional panel members may be added in the future in accordance with implementation needs. Any additions of certified
and qualified inspectors to the panel will be made without promulgation, which was only necessary to establish this
initial panel.

Summary of Significant Comments and Associated Changes 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
One verbal comment was received from EPA Region V. The commenter stated that one of the panel members, Mr. Basim Dihu
of EPA, had the experience to be a panel member for all of the emission points covered in the coke oven NESHAP, i.e., doors,
lids, offtakes, and charging. The proposal indicated that Mr. Dihu was qualified to be a panel member only for door
observations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The commenter is correct. Mr. Dihu's qualifications meet the Agency's criteria. The restrictions in the proposed
list have been removed in the final list, and Mr. Dihu is now considered by the Agency to be a qualified panel member and
able to act as such in the Method 303 certification course.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Executive Order 12291 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major'' and therefore subject to the requirement
of a Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This action does not require any revision to existing State implementation plans (SIP's) or changes to any SIP regulation.
This action is not a major rule because it will neither have an effect on the economy of $100 million or more, nor will
it result in an increase in costs or prices to industry. There will be no adverse impact on the ability of U.S.-based
enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. Because this action is not
a major regulation, no RIA is being conducted.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under Executive Order 12866, [58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)] the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action
is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines
``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector
of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal
governments or communities; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) materially alter the budget impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations
of recipients thereof; or 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles
set forth in the Executive Order. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
OMB had exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
. and has assigned OMB control number 2060&hyph;0253. This proposed action does not add any additional requirements
to those already approved.

Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that
this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because the publication
of this list does not significantly change the status quo for such entities. This regulation therefore does not require
an RFA.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 One facet of oral contraceptive technology which has received little attention over the last three decades is the
development of new orally active estrogens with attractive pharmacologic profiles. These would include hormones
with fewer side effects than those associated with the currently available estrogens, ethynylestradiol and its
3-methyl ether (mestranol), notably nausea, vomiting, alterations in liver function, and histopathology and clotting
disorders. Some clinicians have suggested that the presence of the 17-ethynyl moiety, which protects the steroid
from rapid metabolism by the liver (so-called ``first-pass'' effect) and thus confers oral activity, is also responsible
for many of the side effects observed with these drugs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In an effort to develop nonethynylated estrogens, NICHD has synthesized several estradiol nitrate esters which
exhibit potent estrogenic activity in rats and rhesus monkeys following both oral, subcutaneous, and percutaneous
administration. Using an increase in the uterine weight of immature rats (rat uterotropic test) as an endpoint, two
of these esters were more than five times as potent as ethynylestradiol following oral administration. They also
induce estrogen withdrawal bleeding in ovariectomized rhesus monkeys following both oral and percutaneous administration.
They are very potent postcoital agents following oral administration to rats on days 0&hyph;4 of gestation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The superiority of these esters to ethynylestradiol or its methyl ether as the estrogenic component of oral contraceptive
tablets will depend upon clinical and histopathological findings from toxicity studies in animals and/or clinical
observations in Phase I and II human studies. The estradiol nitrate esters also have considerable potential clinical
utility as replacement estrogens in menopausal women. The most widely used therapeutic regimens involve oral administration
of ethynylestradiol, estradiol or conjugated estrogens (principally estrone sulfate) either continuously or
cyclically, with or without addition of a progestin, much of which depends on the presence or absence of the uterus.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Compounds of this series have been studied for estrogenic potency following oral, subcutaneous and topical administration
and pharmacokinetic data are available on several analogs utilizing radioimmunoassays developed by the Government.
Relative binding affinities to the rat and rabbit uterine estrogen receptor are currently being studied.

In an effort to expedite research, development, and commercialization of the novel estradiol esters, the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development seeks a CRADA partner(s) for joint exploration and possible commercialization.
Any CRADA proposed for these purposes will be considered. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CRADA aims will include the rapid publication of research results consistent with protection of proprietary
information and patentable inventions as well as the timely exploitation of commercial opportunities. The CRADA
partner will enjoy the benefits of first negotiation for licensing Government rights to any inventions arising under
the agreement and will advance funds payable upon signing the CRADA to help defray Government expenses for patenting
such inventions and other CRADA-related costs. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The role of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development will be as follows: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Provide the collaborator with all biological data on compositions of matter covered by the agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Provide samples of compositions of matter covered by the agreement. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The present invention relates to a method of screening the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
in vivo
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 using target cells grown in biocompatible, selectively permeable macrocapsules. Most conventional methods (i.e.,
subcutaneous tumor model, sub-renal tumor model, peritoneal model and the metastasis model) permit only one type
of tumor cell or cell line to be screened per experiment per animal, with the animal subsequently sacrificed for analysis.
The present method allows for placing samples of syngeneic or xenogeneic cells into laboratory animals using cells
or cell lines grown in selectively permeable hollow fibers or dialysis tubing. The invention provides a rapid and
reliable method to screen potential chemotherapeutic agents for therapeutic uses in cancer or other human diseases.
Additionally, the method allows a single experimental animal to carry implants in multiple sites allowing simultaneous
evaluation of a chemotherapeutic agent capacity to reach various physiologic compartments such as subcutaneous,
intraperitoneal or intra-organ regions. The advantages of this system over the classical antitumor animal models
include: 1) the requirement for a smaller amount of test agent to assess preliminary

 efficacy; 2) rapid turn-around time, 3) the ability to test potential activity against multiple tumor types simultaneously
in the same experimental animal; 4) a reduction in the number of experimental animals required for assessing efficacy,
5) the possibility of assessing multiple treatment schedules in a short time frame, 6) the ability to recover the entire
implant, 7) the lack of contamination of the implanted cells by host cell, and 8) the ability to screen a test agent against
target cells cultivated in various physiologic compartments in the same laboratory animal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The present invention can be used in transgenic animals to determine the effect of a transgenic or protein product
thereof on a target cell line. Further, re-cultivating and re-screening the cells after analysis makes its possible
to assess the regrowth potential of cells surviving treatment and then determine their susceptibility to a second
treatment with the same or alternate chemotherapeutic agent(s). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The contemplated fields of use for licensing would be for 1) preclinical testing in animals of products for toxicity
and efficacy, and 2) diagnostic testing in animals of human tissue specimens for resistance and sensitivity to alternative
therapeutic regimes. Spectrum Medical Industries intends to make, use and sell products, falling within the scope
of the patent application for the research and clinical diagnostic markets.

SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Grass Creek Resource Management Plan (RMP) describes and
analyzes four alternative resource management plans, including the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM's) preferred
alternative, developed through public scoping and in consultation with local Governments. The planning area includes
portions of Big Horn, Hot Springs, Park, and Washakie counties in the Bighorn Basin of north central Wyoming. When
completed, the Grass Creek RMP will provide the management direction for future land and resource management actions
on approximately 968,000 acres of public land surface and approximately 1,171,000 acres of Federal mineral estate
administered by the BLM. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft EIS focuses on resolving three key issues identified through public scoping and analysis of current BLM
management in the Grass Creek planning area. These issues are:

2. Special management area designations

3. Public land and resource accessibility and manageability

<!-- PJG /QTAG -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The proposed designation of three Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACECs) is addressed in the draft EIS.
These are the Fifteenmile Creek Watershed proposed ACEC (274,300 acres), the Meeteetse Draw proposed ACEC (6,800
acres), and the Upper Owl Creek proposed ACEC (17,100 acres). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Management of the Fifteenmile Creek Watershed proposed ACEC would emphasize a cooperative approach to improving
riparian and upland areas, and reducing the amount of sediment delivered to the Bighorn River. State and local Government,
private landowners, grazing permittees, and other interested parties would collaborate in managing the area. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Meeteetse Draw proposed ACEC would highlight the importance of Native American cultural values associated with
this area. The primary emphasis of BLM's management would be to improve public education, interpretation, scientific
research, and protection of Native American cultural values. Controlled management of this area would also allow
Native Americans to have access to these sites for ritual purposes and aid in preserving aspects of their heritage.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Upper Owl Creek proposed ACEC would be managed to maintain important wildlife habitat, protect rare plants, maintain
scenic quality, enhance recreation, and reduce erosion and natural hazards associated with the area's landslide
potential. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These proposed ACEC designations would highlight the three areas for management and funding, but would not increase
the level of restrictions on land uses above that which would otherwise be appropriate for management. The special
management designations also would not apply to State or private lands. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In accordance with the provisions of 38 CFR Part 800, parties who are interested in and who wish to be involved in future
activity planning and implementation of management actions that may involve or affect the archaeological and historical
resources addressed in the proposed plan, are requested to identify themselves. Through contacting the Worland
District Office at the below address, you will be placed on a future contact list. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The coal screening process (including application of the coal unsuitability criteria under 43 CFR Part 3461) was
not conducted for the planning effort. Any interest in coal exploration or leasing will be handled on a case-by-case
basis. If an application for a coal lease is received sometime in the future, an appropriate land use environmental
analysis will be conducted (which will include conducting the coal screening process) to determine whether or not
the coal areas applied for are acceptable for development and leasing consideration. The RMP will be amended as necessary.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the course of conducting the planning effort and preparing the Grass Creek RMP EIS, public lands along all waterways
in the planning area were reviewed to determine their eligibility for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic Rivers
System. No public lands were found to meet the eligibility criteria. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The draft EIS contains socio-economic information on the population, employment, and income of the planning area
and describes the impacts on the local economy of implementing each of the four alternatives analyzed in the EIS.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Grass Creek Resource Area is responsible for managing the BLM-administered public lands in portions of Big Horn,
Hot Springs, Park, and Washakie counties in Wyoming. Within the Grass Creek RMP planning area there are varied and
intermingled land surface ownerships and overlapping mineral ownerships. Therefore, the administrative jurisdictions
for land use planning and for managing the land surface and minerals are also varied, intermingled, and sometimes
overlapping. For this reason, it is important to understand that the draft EIS does not address management of lands
(about 302,000 acres) or minerals (about 8,000 acres) within the planning area that are privately-owned or owned
by the State of Wyoming or local Governments. It also does not address those Federally-owned minerals within the planning
area that are under Federal land surface managed by other agencies (about 4,700 acres). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The draft EIS for the Grass Creek RMP presents four alternative, multiple use resource management plans for managing
the BLM-administered public lands in the planning area. Alternative A (continuation of current management) and
three other alternatives that suggest different combinations and emphases for managing the various resource and
land uses on the BLM-administered public lands, on the basis of needs, opportunities, and public demand. The four
alternative plans focus on allocating public lands and resources among their valid uses and prescribing general
management actions that would be taken. The preferred alternative is a combination of parts of alternatives A, B,
and C and represents what BLM believes is the best balance between the public lands and resource uses and environmental
protection in the planning area. The various impacts that would be expected from implementing each of the alternatives
is also presented in the draft EIS.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Kansas City Southern Railway Company (KCS) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR 1152 Subpart F_
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Exempt Abandonments
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 to abandon two rail branch lines as follows: (1) The Baxter Springs Branch from milepost 139.01 L at the connection
with the KCS main line to the end of the line at milepost 148.51 L near Crestline, KS, a distance of 9.50 miles, in Jasper
County, MO and Cherokee County, KS; and (2) the Waco Branch from milepost W 139.80 at the connection with the KCS main
line to the end of the line at milepost W 142.9, in Waco, MO, a distance of 2.69 miles, in Jasper County, MO. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
KCS has certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) overhead traffic has been
rerouted; and (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity
acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or
with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements
at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental report), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication),
and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met.

The Rails to Trails Conservancy (RTC) supports the abandonment and seeks issuance of a notice of interim trail use/rail
banking (NITU) under 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) covering the involved lines. RTC has submitted a statement of willingness
to assume financial responsibility for the trail in compliance with 49 CFR 1152.29. KCS consents to this request and
is willing to negotiate with RTC. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While expressions of interest in interim trail use need not be filed until 10 days after the date the notice of exemption
is published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 [49 CFR 1152.29(b)(2)], the provisions of 16 U.S.C. 1247(d) (Trails Act) are applicable, and all of the criteria for
imposing trail use/rail banking have been met. Accordingly, based on KCS' willingness to enter into negotiations
with RTC, a NITU will be issued. The parties may negotiate an agreement during the 180-day period prescribed below.
If a mutually acceptable final agreement is reached, further Commission approval is not necessary. If no agreement
is reached within 180 days, KCS may fully abandon the lines. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 49 CFR 1152.29(d)(1). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Issuance of this NITU does not preclude other parties from filing interim trail use/rail banking requests. Nor does
it preclude KCS from negotiating with other parties in addition to RTC during the NITU negotiating period. If additional
trail use requests are filed, KCS is directed to respond to them. Use of the rights-of-way for trail purposes is subject
to restoration for railroad purposes. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The parties should note that operation of the trail use procedures could be delayed, or even foreclosed, by the financial
assistance process under 49 U.S.C. 10905. As stated in 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Rail Abandonments_Use of Rights-of-Way as Trails,
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 2 I.C.C.2d 591 (1986) (Trails), offers of financial assistance (OFA) to acquire rail lines for continued rail service
or to subsidize rail operations take priority over interim trail use conditions.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Accordingly, if a formal expression of intent to file an OFA is timely filed under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), the effective
date of this notice will be postponed 10 days beyond the effective date indicated here. In addition, the effective
date may be further postponed at later stages in the OFA process.

See
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 49 CFR 1152.27(e)(2) and (f). Finally, if the line is sold under the OFA procedures, the notice for abandonment exemption
will be dismissed and trail use precluded. Alternatively, if a sale under the OFA procedures does not occur, trail
use may proceed.

after the effective date of this notice of exemption and NITU. Tariff cancellations must refer to this notice by date
and docket number. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. If an interim trail use/rail banking agreement is reached, then with respect to the rights-of-way, it must require
the trail user to assume, for the term of the agreement, full responsibility for management of, for any legal liability
arising out of the transfer or use of (unless the user is immune from liability, in which case it need only indemnify
KCS from any potential liability), and for the payment of any and all taxes that may be levied or assessed against, the

3. Interim trail use/rail banking is subject to the future restoration of rail service and to the user's continuing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. If interim trail use is implemented and subsequently the user intends to terminate trail use, it must send the Commission
a copy of this notice of exemption and NITU and request that it be vacated on a specified date.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. If an agreement for interim trail use/rail banking is reached by the 180th day after service of this decision and
notice, interim trail use may be implemented. If no agreement is reached by that time, KCS may fully abandon the lines.

Robert C. Davis, M.D., Revocation of Registration
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
On June 27, 1994, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA), issued to Robert C. Davis, M.D. (Respondent), an Order to Show Cause proposing to revoke Respondent's DEA Certificate
of Registration, AD2917182, and to deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration. The statutory
basis for the Order to Show Cause was that Respondent's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public
interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4), based upon criminal convictions in the United States
District Court, District of Utah. These criminal convictions included Medicaid, insurance and mail fraud counts,
as well as some counts pertaining to prescribing controlled substances not for a legitimate medical purpose and not
in the course of professional practice. The proposed action was also based upon Respondent's lack of state authorization
to handle controlled substances in the State of Utah. 21 U.S.C. 824(a)(3). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Order to Show Cause was sent to Respondent by registered mail and was received by him on July 5, 1994. Respondent
filed a request for hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was docketed before Administrative
Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. On August 3, 1994, the Government filed a motion for summary disposition based upon an
order of the State of Utah, Department of Commerce, Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing (Licensing
Board) which revoked Respondent's medical license and authority to handle controlled substances for an indefinite
period, effective July 7, 1993. In his response to the Government's motion, Respondent argued that a hearing on this
matter should be held because Respondent was appealing the criminal convictions on which the Licensing Board's revocation
order was based and that Respondent would reapply for a medical license in the State of Utah if his convictions were
overturned on appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On August 19, 1994, in her opinion and recommended decision, the administrative law judge granted the Government's
motion for summary disposition and recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration, issued to him
in Utah, be revoked based upon Respondent's current lack of state authorization to handle controlled substances
in Utah. Neither party filed exceptions to the recommended decision. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
On September 22, 1994, the administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Deputy Administrator. The Deputy
Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues
his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Deputy Administrator finds that on July 7, 1994, the State of Utah, Department of Commerce, Division of Occupational
and Professional Licensing issued an order revoking Respondent's medical license. As a result, he is not currently
authorized by Utah to handle controlled substances. The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain
the registration of a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which
he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f) and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld.

The administrative law judge granted the Government's motion for summary disposition. It is well-settled that when
no question of fact is involved, or when the facts are agreed upon, a plenary, adversary administrative proceeding
involving evidence and cross-examination of witnesses is not obligatory. The rationale is that Congress does not
intend administrative agencies to perform meaningless tasks. Philip E. Kirk, M.D., 48 FR 32887 (1983); aff'd. sub

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Respondent argues that the criminal convictions, which he maintains were the only basis of the Licensing Board's
revocation order, could be overturned on appeal and that Respondent then would reapply and obtain his state medical
license. This scenario is only speculation. Until the Licensing Board reinstates Respondent's medical license,
the DEA does not have the statutory authority under the Controlled Substances Act to continue the registration of
a practitioner unless that practitioner is currently authorized to handle controlled substances in the state where
he is registered with the DEA.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

The Deputy Administrator, having considered the entire record, adopts the administration law judge's opinion and
recommended decision in its entirety. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration,
pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104, hereby orders that DEA
Certificate of Registration, AD2917182, previously issued to Robert C. Davis, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked
and that any pending applications for renewal of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective
December 12, 1994.

Description: As noted in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, the public reporting burden for this collection of information
is expected to increase, based upon the Department's operating experience, from an average of one hour per response
to one and one-quarter hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing information/data
sources, gathering and maintaining the information/data needed, and preparing the application. The reporting
burden is expected to increase due to the proposed requirement that employers provide notice to H&hyph;1B nonimmigrants
of the terms and conditions of employment. The employer will be required to attest that it has provided, or will provide,
to each H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant a copy of the Labor Condition Application (LCA) under which they are employed no later
than the date the H&hyph;1B nonimmigrant reports to work at the place of employment. This is the only amendment contained
in the final rule which is expected to increase the reporting burden per response.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Further, at the request of a number of commenters, boxes have been added to Item 7(e), ``Prevailing Wage Rate and Its
Source.'' If the employer is relying on a prevailing wage determination obtained from a State Employment Security
Agency (SESA), the employer will only be required to specify the rate and check the box marked ``SESA,'' as opposed
to writing the name of the agency. If the employer utilized some other source to determine the prevailing wage, the
employer must specify the rate, check the box marked ``Other,'' and specify such other source.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

The proposed meetings are for the purpose of panel review, discussion, evaluation and recommendation on applications
for financial assistance under the National Foundation on the Arts the Humanities Act of 1965, as amended, including
discussion of information given in confidence to the agency by the grant applicants. Because the proposed meetings
will consider information that is likely to disclose: (1) trade secrets and commercial or financial information
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential; or (2) information of a personal nature the disclosure of which
would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, pursuant to authority granted me by the Chairman's
Delegation of Authority to Close Advisory Committee meetings, dated July 19, 1993, I have determined that these meetings
will be closed to the public pursuant to subsections (c) (4), and (6) of section 552b of Title 5, United States Code.

<DOCTITLE>In the Matter of All Reactor Licensees With Installed Thermo-Lag 330&hyph;1 Fire Barrier Material Receipt of Petitions
for Director's Decision Under 10 CFR 2.206 </DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that by separate letters dated October 21, 1994, the GE Stockholders' Alliance and Dr. D.K.
Cinquemani; by letter dated October 25, 1994, the Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy; and by letter dated October 26,
1994, R. Benjan (Petitioners) request that the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) take action with regard
to the use of Thermo-Lag by all reactor licensees and that their letters be treated as Petitions pursuant to &sect;2.206
of Title 10 of the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Code of Federal Regulations 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(10 CFR). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Dr. Cinquemani and Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy request that the NRC immediately shut down all reactors where
Thermo-Lag is used until it has been removed and replaced. GE Stockholders' Alliance requests shutdown of all reactors
where Thermo-Lag is used until it has been removed and replaced with fire-retardant material meeting NRC standards.
R. Benjan requests immediate shutdown of all reactors where Thermo-Lag is used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As the bases for their requests, the Petitioners state, either individually or collectively, that 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) the widespread use of Thermo-Lag, in more than 70 reactors, presents a safety crisis; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) the NRC has known since 1982 that Thermo-Lag fails NRC performance standards for material that protects vital
electrical cables for ampacity rating and fire resistance; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) Thermo-Lag has failed not only NRC tests, but almost all other independent tests; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) Thermo-Lag is combustible, contrary to NRC regulations, and is an ineffective fire barrier; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) the use of Thermo-Lag could lead to shorts, to failure of the cables in an emergency, and to fire; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) Thermo-Lag is faulty in that fraudulent ampacity ratings allowed utilities to use smaller cable than permitted
by design requirements, causing the cable to overheat and its insulation to deteriorate; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) the NRC has stated that fire at some nuclear power plants can contribute as much as 50 percent of the risk to a core
meltdown, and a typical reactor will have three to four significant fires during its licensed lifetime; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) Thermal Science, Inc., the manufacturer of Thermo-Lag, and its president were indicted by Federal grand jury
on seven criminal charges related to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. Government in regard to the effectiveness of Thermo-Lag;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(9) the hourly fire watches at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power plant operated by Toledo Edison do not replace fire barrier
material and do not prevent fires. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Petitions are being treated pursuant to 10 CFR 2.206 of the Commissions regulations and have been referred to the
Director of the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. As provided by 10 CFR 2.206, appropriate action will be taken
on these petitions within a reasonable time. By letter dated December 15, 1994, the Director denied the requests of
GE Stockholders' Alliance, Dr. Cinquemani, Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy, and R. Benjan for immediate suspension
of the operating licenses of all reactors where Thermo-Lag is used. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<DOCTITLE>Atomic Energy of Canada, Limited Technologies Receipt of Application for Design Certification</DOCTITLE>
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Notice is hereby given that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has received an application from
Atomic Energy of Canada, Limited Technologies dated September 30, 1994, filed pursuant to Section 103 of the Atomic
Energy Act and 10 CFR Part 52, for the standard design certification of the CANDU 3U Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor
Plant. A notice relating to the rulemarking pursuant to 10 CFR 52.51 for design certification, including provisions
for participation of the public and other parties, will be published in the future.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The CANDU 3U is a 450 MWe pressurized heavy water reactor design. A unique feature that distinguishes the CANDU 3U from
the current generation of light water reactors designed in the United States is the use of natural uranium fuel contained
in a pressurized heavy water coolant system and a separate heavy water moderator system. The CANDU 3U application
includes the entire power generation complex, except those elements and features considered site specific.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The staff has determined that the application does not contain all information required by 10 CFR 52.47. A docket number
is being assigned to the application to facilitate public access to correspondence and review information. Although
no formal review schedule will be established until an updated Safety Analysis Report and schedules for all information
required has been received, the NRC staff will continue limited review of the application. This is consistent with
the letter of September 30, 1994, ``.&blank;.&blank;. that no major activity will be initiated by 
<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->

<!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->
the NRC beyond the acceptance review .&blank;.&blank;. .''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A copy of the application is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman
Building, 2120 L Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Previous correspondence on this application is filed under Project
number 679. The new docket established for this application is STN&hyph;52&hyph;005.

Susquehanna Steam Electric Station Units 1 &amp; 2; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility
Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating
License Nos. NPF&hyph;14 &amp; NPF&hyph;22 issued to Pennsylvania Power &amp; Light Company for operation of the
Susquehanna Steam Electric Station, Units 1 and 2, located in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed amendment would add the Special Test Exception 3/4.10.6, ``Inservice Leak and Hydrostatic Testing,''
that allows the performance of pressure testing at reactor coolant temperature up to 212
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F while remaining in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4. This special test exception would also require that certain OPERATIONAL
CONDITION 3 Specifications for Secondary Containment Isolation, Secondary Containment Integrity and Standby
Gas Treatment System operability be met. This change would also revise the Index, Table 1.2, ``OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS,''
and the Bases to incorporate the reference to the proposed special test exception. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the
proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident
previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously
evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee
has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed changes are requested to allow inservice leak and hydrostatic testing, with the reactor in OPERATIONAL
CONDITION 4 and the average reactor coolant temperature up to 212
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The change to allow inservice leak and hydrostatic testing in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4 will not increase the
probability or the consequences of an accident. The probability of a leak in the reactor coolant pressure boundary
during inservice leak and hydrostatic testing is not increased by considering the reactor in OPERATIONAL CONDITION
4. The hydrostatic or inservice leak test is performed water solid or near water solid, and temperatures less than
or equal to 212
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The stored energy in the reactor core will be very low and the potential for failed fuel and a subsequent increase
in coolant activity above Technical Specification limits are minimal. In addition, secondary containment will
be operable and capable of handling airborne radioactivity from leaks that could occur during the performance of
hydrostatic or inservice leak testing. Requiring the secondary containment to be operable will ensure that potential
airborne radiation from leaks will be filtered through the Standby Gas Treatment System, thus limiting radiation
releases to the environment. Therefore, the change will not significantly increase the consequences of an accident.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the event of a large primary system leak, the reactor vessel would rapidly depressurize allowing the low pressure
ECCS systems to operate. The capability of the systems that are required for OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4 would be adequate
to keep the core flooded under this condition. Small system leaks would be detected by leakage inspections before
significant inventory loss occurred. This is an integral part of the hydrostatic testing program. Therefore, this
change will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Allowing the reactor to be considered in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4 during hydrostatic or leak testing, with a reactor
coolant temperature of up to 212
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F, is an exception to certain OPERATIONAL CONDITION 3 requirements, including primary containment integrity
and total Emergency Core Cooling System operability. The hydrostatic or inservice leakage test is performed water
solid, or near water solid, and coolant temperature less than or equal to 212
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The stored energy in the reactor core will be very low and the potential for failed fuel and a subsequent increase
in coolant activity above Technical Specification limits are minimal. In addition, the secondary containment will
be operable and capable of handling airborne radioactivity from leaks that could occur during the performance of
hydrostatic or inservice leakage testing. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The inservice leak or hydrostatic test conditions remain unchanged. The potential for a system leak remains unchanged
since the reactor coolant system is designed for temperatures exceeding 500
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F with similar pressures. There are no alternations of any plant systems that cope with the spectrum of accidents.
The only difference is that a different subset of systems would be utilized for accident mitigation from those of OPERATIONAL
CONDITION 3. Therefore, this change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any
previously evaluated. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The proposed change allows inservice leak and hydrostatic testing to be performed with a reactor coolant temperature
up to 212
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F and the reactor in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4. Since the reactor vessel head will be in place, secondary containment
integrity will be maintained and all systems required in OPERATIONAL CONDITION 4 will be operable in accordance with
the Technical Specifications, the proposed change will not have any significant impact on any design bases accident
or safety limit. The hydrostatic or inservice leak testing is performed water solid, or near water solid, and temperature
less than or equal to 212
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F. The stored energy in the core is very low and the potential for failed fuel and a subsequent increase in coolant
activity would be minimal. The reactor pressure vessel would rapidly depressurize in the event of a large primary
system leak and the low pressure injection systems required to be operable in OPERATION CONDITION 4 would be adequate
to keep the core flooded. This would ensure that the fuel would not exceed the 2200
<!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong -->
&cir;F peak clad temperature limit.

Also requiring secondary containment integrity will assure that potential airborne radiation can be filtered through
the SGTS. This will assure that offsite does remain well within the limits of 10 CFR 100 guidelines. Small system leaks
would be detected by inspections before significant inventory loss could occur. Therefore, this special test exception
will not involve a significant reduction in safety margin. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of
10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves
no significant hazards consideration. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after
the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However,
should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,
in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the
30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards
consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission
take this action, it will publish in the

 a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need
to take this action will occur very infrequently.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
By January 23, 1995, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject
facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate
as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests
for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice
for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714
which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC, and at the local public document room located at the Osterhout Free Library, Reference Department, 71 South Franklin
Street, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania 18701. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by
the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman
of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the
petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition
should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following
factors; (1) the nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and
extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect
of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The Petition should also identify
the specific aspect(s) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person
who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting
leave of the Board up to 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended
petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Not later than 15 days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file
a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions which are sought to be litigated
in the matter. Each contention must consist of a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.
In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the basis of the contention and a concise statement
of the alleged facts or expert opinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intends to rely in proving
the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must also provide references to those specific sources and documents
of which the petitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establish those facts or expert opinion.
Petitioner must provide sufficient information to show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a material
issue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration.
The contention must be one which, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitioner who fails to file
such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted
to participate as a party.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the order granting leave
to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity
to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a hearing is requested, the commission will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards consideration.
The final determination will serve to decide when the hearing is held.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration, the Commission
may issue the amendment and make it immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing
held would take place after issuance of the amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the final determination is that the amendment request involves a significant hazards consideration, any hearing
held would take place before the issuance of any amendment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Services Branch, or may be delivered
to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date.
Where petitions are filed during the last 10 days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioner promptly
so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to Western Union at 1&hyph;(800) 248&hyph;5100 (in Missouri
1&hyph;(800) 342&hyph;6700). The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number N1023
and the following message addressed to John F. Stolz: petitioner's name and telephone number, date petition was mailed,
plant name, and publication date and page number of this

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice. A copy of the petition should also be sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to Jay Silberg, Esquire, Shaw, Pittman, Potts, and Trowbridge, 2300 N Street NW., Washington,
DC 20037, attorney for the licensee.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions, supplemental petitions and/or requests
for hearing will not be entertained absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the presiding
Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request should be granted based upon a balancing of the
factors specified in 10 CFR 2.714(a)(l)(i)&hyph;(v) and 2.714(d).

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA or the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;33,
DPR&hyph;52, DPR&hyph;68, DPR&hyph;77, DPR&hyph;79 for the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Units 1, 2 and 3 (BFN) and
the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2 (SQN), respectively. For the Watts Bar nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2 (WBN), TVA
is the holder of Construction Permits CPPR&hyph;91 and CPPR&hyph;92, respectively, since Operating Licenses have
not been issued. The licenses provide, among other things, that the licensee is subject to all rules, regulations,
and orders of the Commission in effect now and hereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The facilities consist of two pressurized water reactors at Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2, located in Soddy
Daisy, Tennessee; three boiling water reactors at Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, Units 1, 2 and 3, located in Limestone
County, Alabama; and two pressurized water reactors under construction at Watts Bar Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2,
located at TVA's site on the west bank of the Tennessee River approximately 50 miles northeast of Chattanooga, Tennessee.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Title 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for physical protection of licensed activities in nuclear power reactors against
radiological sabotage,'' paragraph (a), in part, states that ``The licensee shall establish and maintain an onsite
physical protection system and security organization which will have as its objective to provide high assurance
that activities involving special nuclear material are not inimical to the common defense and security and do not
constitute an unreasonable risk to the public health and safety.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), specifies that ``The licensee shall control all points
of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) requires that ``A numbered picture badge
identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.''
10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors) may be authorized
access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the
protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area .&blank;.&blank;.''
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TVA has proposed to implement an alternative unescorted access control system that would eliminate the need to issue
and retrieve badges at each entrance/exit location and would allow all individuals with unescorted access to keep
their badges with them when departing the site.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An exemption from 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) is required to allow contractors who have unescorted access to take their badges
offsite instead of returning them when exiting the site. By letter dated October 24, 1994, TVA requested an exemption
from the requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) for this purpose.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, ``Specific exemptions,'' the Commission may, upon application of any interested person
or upon its own initiative, grant such exemptions in this part as it determines are authorized by law and will not endanger
life or property or the common defense and security, and are otherwise in the public interest. Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55,
the Commission may authorize a licensee to provide alternative measures for protection against radiological sabotage
provided the licensee demonstrates that the alternative measures have ``the same high assurance objective'' and
meet ``the general performance requirements'' of the regulation, and ``the overall level of system performance
provides protection against radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Currently, unescorted access into the protected areas at the operating TVA plants is controlled through the use of
a photograph on a badge/keycard (hereafter, referred to as ``badge''). The security officers at each entrance station
use the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The badges for both TVA employees
and contractor personnel who have been granted unescorted access are issued upon entrance at each entrance/exit
location and are returned upon exit. The badges are stored and are retrievable at each entrance/exit location. In
accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), contractors are not allowed to take these badges offsits.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the proposed biometric system, each individual who is authorized unescorted entry into protected areas would
have the physical characteristics of his/her hand (i.e., hand geometry) registered, along with his/her badge number,
in the access control system. When a registered user enters his/her badge into the card reader and places his/her hand
onto the measuring surface, the system detects that the hand is properly positioned, and records the image. The unique
characteristics of the hand image is then compared with the previously stored template in the access control computer
system corresponding to the badge to verify authorization for entry.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Individuals, including TVA employees and contractors, would be allowed to keep their badge with them when they depart
the site and, thus, eliminate the need to issue, retrieve and store badges at the entrance stations to the plant. Badges
do not carry any information other then a unique identification number. All other access processes, including search
function capability, would remain the same. This system would not be used for persons requiring escorted access;
i.e., visitors.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on a Sandia report entitled, ``A Performance Evaluation of Biometrics Identification Devices'' (SAND910276
UC_906 Unlimited Release, Printed June 1991), and on its experience with the current photo-identification system,
TVA determined that the false-accept rate for the hand geometry system will be at least equal to the current photo-identification
system in used at the TVA plants. The biometric system has been in use for a number of years at several sensitive Department
of Energy facilities and, recently, at nuclear power plants.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
TVA will implement a process for testing the proposed system to ensure continued overall level of performance equivalent
to that specified in the regulation. When the changes are implemented, the respective Physical Security Plans will
be revised to include implementation and testing of the hand geometry access control system and to allow TVA employees
and contractors to take their badges offsite.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
When implemented, TVA will control all points of personnel access into a protected area under the observation of security
personnel through the use of a badge and hand geometry verification system. The numbered picture badge identification
system will continue to be used for all individuals who are authorized unescorted access to protected areas. Badges
will continue to be displayed by all individuals while inside the protected area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since both the badge and hand geometry would be necessary for access into the protected area, the proposed system would
provide a positive verification process. The potential loss of a badge by an individual as a result of taking the badge
offsite would not enable an unauthorized entry into protected areas.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
For the foregoing reasons, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, the NRC staff has determined that the proposed alternative measures
for protection against radiological sabotage meet ``the same high assurance objective,'' and ``the general performance
requirements'' of the regulation and that ``the overall level of system performance provides protection against
radiological sabotage equivalent'' to that which would be provided by the regulation.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 73.5, an exemption is authorized by law, will
not endanger life or property or common defense and security, and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore,
the Commission hereby grants an exemption from those requirements of 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) relating to the returning
of picture badges upon exit from the protected area such that individuals not employed by TVA, i.e., contractors,
who are authorized unescorted access into the protected areas at the Browns Ferry, Sequoyah, and Watts Bar Nuclear
Plants can take their badges offsite.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the granting of this exemption will not result in any significant
adverse environmental impact (59 FR 61351).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated October 24, 1994, which is available
for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and at the local
public document room located at the Athens Public Library, South Street, Athens, Alabama (for the BFN Plant), and
at the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Library, 1101 Broad Street, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402 (for the SQN and WBN
Plants).
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This exemption is effective upon issuance. It is expected to be implemented for each plant separately when modifications,
procedures, and training are completed at the respective plant.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 -->
SUMMARY:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 This notice provides information for public comment on the Postal Service's proposal to amend USPS Privacy Act System
050.005_Finance Records_Accounts Receivable Files Maintenance. The Postal Service proposes to delete one category
of individuals covered by the system, to make minor editorial changes for clarity, and to add four new routine uses.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The new routine uses will permit the Postal Service to disclose to other federal agencies certain information identifying
Postal Service debtors and to implement new procedures that will facilitate recovery of those debts. The proposed
new routine uses will enable the Postal Service to participate in a computer matching program with the Department
of Defense to identify Postal Service debtors employed by other federal agencies, to initiate salary offset where
appropriate, and to initiate income tax refund offset for non-federal employee debtors. In addition, a new routine
use will enable the Postal Service to use the taxpayer address verification process of the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This notice complies with subsection (e)(11) of the Privacy Act, which requires agencies to publish advance notice
of any new use of information in a system of records.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The Postal Service is expanding its debt recovery procedures in order to recover more of its delinquent debt. To do
so, the Postal Service plans to participate in the federal salary offset program administered by the Financial Management
Service, Office of the Treasury, and the federal income tax refund offset and taxpayer address verification programs
administered by the IRS. The amendments proposed here are necessary to implement the new procedures in compliance
with the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. A full description of USPS Privacy Act System 050.005 was last published at
54 FR 43667, dated October 26, 1989, and amended at 57 FR 57516, dated December 4, 1992. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Postal Service is modifying the name of this system of records to ``Accounts Receivable Files,'' a more comprehensive
name that better describes the system of records. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service is deleting from Categories of Individuals Covered by the System those customers whose checks
are returned by the bank. These types of debts are no longer included in the Accounts Receivable automated system as
part of the system of records. Accordingly, each such customer's bank name and account number, date and amount of check,
and identifying number from driver's license, passport, or military ID are being deleted from Categories of Records
in the System. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Postal Service is adding four new routine uses for USPS Privacy Act System 050.005. Proposed new routine use number
4 of this system provides for the disclosure of the names and social security numbers of Postal Service debtors to the
Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) of the Department of Defense for conducting a computer matching program to identify
and locate debtors who are federal employees in order to initiate salary offset procedures. Proposed new routine
use number 5 provides for the disclosure of debtor-identifying information to any federal agency where the debtor
is employed to enable that agency to collect the debt on behalf of the Postal Service through salary offset. Proposed
new routine use number 6 provides for the disclosure of debtor-identifying information to the IRS through computer
matching to obtain the current mailing addresses of non-federal employee taxpayers for locating the taxpayers to
collect postal debts. Proposed new routine use number 7 provides for the disclosure of debtor-identifying information
to the IRS to enable the IRS to collect the debt on behalf of the Postal Service through income tax refund offset. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because the above disclosures each will assist in the recovery of Postal Service debt, these new routine uses are clearly
compatible with the purposes for which records are maintained in USPS Privacy Act System 050.005. The above-described
amendments and the addition of these routine uses require submission of an altered system report; the report was submitted
to the Office of Management and Budget and both houses of Congress 10 days before publication of this notice.

the debtor is employed or receiving some form of remuneration for enabling that agency to collect the debt on behalf
of the Postal Service by counseling to debtor for voluntary repayment, or by initiating administrative or salary
offset procedures under the Debt Collection Act of 1982. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. Disclosure of information about individuals indebted to the Postal Service may be made to the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) through computer matching to obtain the mailing address of a taxpayer for locating such taxpayer to
collect a debt owed to the Postal Service pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2) and in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711, 3717,

The Trust and LAMCO, for themselves and on behalf of present and future sub-advisers of the Trust, request a conditional
order of exemption from section 15(a) of the Act with respect to the portion of the Trust's assets subject to LAMCO's
supervision. The requested order would let the Trust and LAMCO change or add sub-advisers, or continue the services
of a sub-adviser following an assignment of its sub-advisory agreement, and delay shareholder approval of the new
sub-advisory agreements with such sub-advisers until the Trust's next annual meeting of shareholders.

Applicants' Representations
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. The Trust is a closed-end diversified management investment company whose shares are listed and traded on the New
York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''). In accordance with NYSE rules, the Trust holds annual meetings of shareholders.
LAMCO, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, is a registered investment adviser
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. From its inception in 1986 through May 27, 1994, the Trust's sole investment manager and administrator was Growth
Stock Outlook Inc. (``GSO''). On May 27, 1994, following shareholder approval, the Trust entered into a fund management
agreement with LAMCO. Under the terms of that agreement, LAMCO provides a ``multi-manager'' methodology of portfolio
management with respect to an initial amount equal to 20% of the Trust's total net assets (the ``Multi-Managed Assets'').
The remainder of the Trust's assets are managed by GSO acting under a separate investment advisory agreement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The Multi-Managed Assets may be increased or decreased as a result of investment income, gains or losses on such
assets, and dividends, distributions and operating expenses payable on such assets. In addition, under the terms
of an Asset Acquisition and Fund Management Transition Agreement dated February 9, 1994, among LAMCO, GSO and GSO's
principal stockholder, it is contemplated that, subject to certain conditions that must be met prior to the Trust's
1996 annual meeting of shareholders, a new fund management agreement may be entered into with LAMCO with respect to
all the assets of the Trust.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. LAMCO has allocated the Multi-Managed Assets on an approximately equal basis among three independent investment
management firms (the ``Sub-Advisers'') acting under identical sub-advisory agreements with the Trust and LAMCO
approved by shareholders at their May 27, 1994 meeting. LAMCO selected and recommended the Sub-Advisers using certain
specific criteria. In that regard, each of the present and future Sub-Advisers must consistently employ a distinct,
identifiable investment style that differs from those of the other Sub-Advisers. Further, the range of styles must
be sufficiently broad so that at least one of them may be expected to be in favor in all reasonably foreseeable market
conditions. Finally, each Sub-Adviser's longer-term investment performance must be satisfactory when compared
to other investment management firms employing a similar style. The goal of this multi-manager methodology as applied
to the Multi-Managed Assets is to produce better investment performance over time with less volatility than that
of the average single-manager fund with the same investment objective and policies.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. LAMCO continuously reviews the performance of the Sub-Advisers to identify the presence of factors or conditions
that would tend to neutralize the effect of the multi-management methodology as applied to the Multi-Managed Assets,
such as a departure by a Sub-Adviser from its investment style, a deterioration in its investment performance relative
to that of other investment management firms employing similar styles, or an adverse change in its personnel or organization.
Based upon its review, LAMCO recommends appropriate changes in Sub-Advisers.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Each new sub-advisory agreement would affect no more than approximately one-third of the Multi-Managed Assets.
Accordingly, no more than approximately one-third of 20% of the Trust's total net assets currently will be affected
by any one Sub-Adviser change. In the future, because the amount of the Trust's total net assets represented by the
Multi-Managed Assets may increase or decrease in a manner described in paragraph 3 above, any one Sub-Adviser change
may affect a greater or lesser amount of the Trust's total net assets, but never more than approximately one-third
of the Trust's total net assets.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. In addition, each new sub-advisory agreement would contain substantially the same terms and conditions as the
existing sub-advisory agreements for the Multi-Managed Assets. A new Sub-Adviser's fee can be no higher than that
provided in the Trust's three existing sub-advisory agreements. In the event that fees under the new sub-advisory
agreement are less than in the existing agreements, the difference will be passed on to the Trust through a corresponding
reduction in the fund management fee payable to LAMCO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. None of the Sub-Advisers has any affiliation with the Trust or LAMCO other than as Sub-Adviser. The responsibility
of the Sub-Advisers under their respective sub-advisory agreements is limited to the discretionary investment
management of the respective portions of the Multi-Managed Assets assigned to them by LAMCO from time to time, and
related record keeping and reporting. The Multi-Managed Assets are and will be allocated and periodically rebalanced
so as to maintain an approximately equal allocation of such assets among the Sub-Advisers.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants' Legal Analysis
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Section 15(a) of the Act makes it unlawful for any person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment
company except pursuant to a written contract, whether with such registered company or with an investment adviser
of such registered company, which has been approved by the majority vote of the outstanding voting securities of such
registered company. Section 15(a)(4) also requires that the investment advisory contract provide, in substance,
for its automatic termination in the event of its assignment.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Rule 15a&hyph;4 under the Act permits an investment adviser to an investment company to act under an agreement not
approved by shareholders for up to 120 days after the termination of an investment advisory agreement resulting from
certain specified events. Applicants claim, however, that rule 15a&hyph;4 does not provide adequate relief to the
Trust. For one thing, a change in Sub-Advisers may occur more than 120 days before the next regularly scheduled annual
meeting, resulting in the necessity of a special meeting of shareholders. In addition, rule 15a&hyph;4 does not apply
at all to an investment advisory agreement entered into following a termination of the prior agreement caused by an
assignment in which the investment adviser or its controlling person receives an economic benefit.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Applicants submit that requiring shareholder approval consistent with section 15(a) before changing a Sub-Adviser
or before continuing the services of an existing Sub-Adviser following an assignment of its sub-advisory agreement
results in substantial delay or expense to the Trust, without any corresponding benefit in terms of shareholder protection.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Applicants assert that, because of the lack of affiliation between LAMCO and the Sub-Advisers (unlike conventionally
structured single-manager investment companies), LAMCO has no interest other than the efficient and effective
functioning of the Trust's multi-manager methodology and the enhancement of the Trust's investment performance
when recommending the replacement or addition of a Sub-adviser or the continuation of the services of the Sub-Adviser
following an assignment of its sub-advisory agreement. Furthermore, Applicants represent that neither LAMCO nor
any of its affiliates will be parties to the acquisition or other transaction giving rise to the termination and assignment
of the sub-advisory agreement and, consequently, will not receive any economic benefit in connection with such transaction.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Applicants also assert that the terms and conditions of the Trust's ``employment'' of its Sub-Advisers will in
effect have already been approved by shareholders because any new sub-advisory agreements will be identical in all
material respects to the existing agreements which have been approved by shareholders, with no increase in expense
to the Trust.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
6. Applicants further assert that, in view of the limited function of the Sub-Advisers and the fact that no more than
approximately one-third of the Multi-Managed Assets will be affected by any one Sub-Adviser change, addition or
continuation, the Trust's shareholders are significantly less dependent on any one Sub-Adviser than are the shareholders
of a conventionally structured single manager fund. As a result, the need for the protection provided by the shareholder
approval requirement of section 15(a) is correspondingly less.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Section 6(c) of the Act authorizes the SEC to exempt persons or transactions from the provisions of the Act to the
extent that such exemptions are necessary or approximate in the public interest and consistent with the protection
of investors and the purposes fairly intended by he policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants submit that the requested
exemptive relief from section 15(a) would be consistent with the standards set forth in section 6(c) of the Act and
would be in the best interests of the Trust and its shareholders.

Applicants' Conditions
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Each new sub-advisory agreement will be submitted for ratification and approval to the vote of the Trust's shareholders
no later than at the regularly scheduled annual meeting of shareholders of the Trust next following the effective
date of the new sub-advisory agreement, and its continuance after such meeting will be conditioned on approval by
the required majority vote of such shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. The Trust will continue to hold annual meetings of its shareholders, whether or not required to do so by the rules
of the NYSE or otherwise.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. The directors of the Trust, in addition to approving the new sub-advisory agreement in accordance with the requirements
of section 15(c) of the Act, will specifically determine that entering into the new sub-advisory agreement in advance
of the next regular annual meeting of shareholders of the Trust and without prior shareholder approval is in furtherance
of the multi-manager methodology as applied to the Multi-Managed Assets and is in the best interests of the Trust and
its shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. The new sub-advisory agreement involved will, when entered into, affect no more than approximately one-third
of the Multi-Managed Assets.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. The new Sub-Adviser will have no affiliation with the Trust or LAMCO other than as Sub-Adviser, and will have no duties
or responsibilities with respect to the Trust beyond the investment management of the portion of the Multi-Managed
Assets allocated to it by LAMCO from time to time and related record keeping and reporting.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. The new sub-advisory agreement will provide for a portfolio management fee no higher than that provided in the Trust's
existing sub-advisory agreements with respect to the Multi-Managed Assets, and, except for the provisions relating
to shareholder approval referred to in condition 1 above, will be on substantially the same other terms and conditions
as such existing agreements. In the event that the new sub-advisory agreement provides for sub-advisory fees at rates
less than those provided in the existing sub-advisory agreements, the difference will be passed on to the Trust and
its shareholders through a corresponding voluntary reduction in the fund agreement fee payable by the Trust to LAMCO.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. The appointment of the new or successor Sub-Adviser will be announced by press release promptly following the directors'
action referred to in condition 3 above, and a notice of the new sub-advisory agreement, together with a description
of the new or successor Sub-Adviser, will be included in the Trust's next report to shareholders.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
8. LAMCO will provide overall supervisory responsibility for the general management and investment of the Multi-Manager
Assets, subject to the Trust's investment objectives and policies and any directions of the Trust's directors. In
particular, LAMCO will (i) provide overall investment programs and strategies for the Multi-Managed Assets, (ii)
recommend to the Trust's directors investment management firms for appointment or replacement as Sub-Advisers
for the Multi-Managed Assets, (iii) allocate and reallocate the Multi-Managed Assets among the Sub-Advisers, and
(iv) monitor and evaluate the investment performance of the Sub-Advisers, including their compliance with the Trust's
investment objectives, policies and restrictions.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
9. In the case of a new sub-advisory agreement with an existing Sub-Adviser or its successor following an ``assignment,''
as that term is defined in the Act and the rules thereunder, of the Trust's sub-advisory agreement with that Sub-Adviser,
the Sub-Adviser (or its successor) or LAMCO will pay the incremental cost of including the proposal to approve or disapprove
ratification of the new sub-advisory agreement in the proxy material for the Trust's next annual meeting of shareholders.

Applicant Representations

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1. Applicant, a California corporation and an open-end management investment company, registered under the Act
on September 7, 1983. On September 30, 1993, applicant filed a registration statement to register its shares under
the Securities Act of 1933. The registration statement became effective on September 30, 1983, and the initial public
offering of its shares commenced promptly thereafter.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. On October 12, 1994, subject to shareholder approval, applicant's board of directors unanimously determined
that it was in the best interest of the shareholders to liquidate. The decision of the board was based primarily on the
small size of the applicant; the resulting high ratio of expenses to average net assets and the difficulty in achieving
the diversification and investment objectives. Accordingly, on or about October 24, 1994, proxy materials were
distributed to shareholders. On November 1, 1994, the holders of a majority of the shares voted to take all necessary
and advisable actions to effect the winding-up and dissolution of applicant's business. On November 18, 1994, all
of applicants' outstanding shares were redeemed and payments were made at applicant's net asset value.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Distributions to all securityholders in complete liquidation of their interests have been made. Applicant incurred
$894 in total brokerage commissions with respect to sales of its portfolio securities.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. On October 24, 1994, there were issued and outstanding 196,764 shares of common stock having a net asset value of
$9.08 per share and $1,786,617 in the aggregate.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. Liquidation expenses of approximately $6,800 for transfer agency, accounting, custody, tax reporting and legal
fees will be borne by Wood Island Associates, Inc., applicant's investment adviser.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
6. As of the date of this application, applicant has no debts or liabilities and is not a party to any litigation or administrative
proceeding. Applicant is neither engaged in, nor does it propose to engage in, any business activities other than
those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
7. Applicant has filed all documents required to terminate its existence as a California corporation.

SUMMARY:

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with the procedures governing the application for, and the processing of, exemptions from the Department
of Transportation's Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR Part 107, Subpart B), notice is hereby given that the
Office of Hazardous Materials Safety has received the applications described herein. This notice is abbreviated
to expedite docketing and public notice. Because the sections affected, modes of transportation, and the nature
of application have been shown in earlier Federal Register publications, they are not repeated here. Requests for
modifications of exemptions (e.g. to provide for additional hazardous materials, packaging design changes, additional
mode of transportation, etc.) are described in footnotes to the application number. Application numbers with the
suffix ``X'' denote a modification request. Application numbers with the suffix ``P'' denote a party to request.
These applications have been separated from the new applications for exemptions to facilitate processing.

Background 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 309(a) of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;325
(12 U.S.C. 4806) (the Act), which was signed into law on September 23, 1994, requires the OCC, the Office of Thrift Supervision,
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Board (Federal banking agencies) and the National
Credit Union Administration to establish an independent internal appellate process. This process must be available
to review material supervisory determinations made at insured depository institutions or credit unions that the
agency supervises. Section 309(c) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 4806(c)) requires that each Federal banking agency must provide
public notice and opportunity for comment on its proposed guidelines for this appellate process by December 22, 1994,
and establish this process by March 22, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act defines ``independent appellate process'' in section 309(f)(2) (12 U.S.C. 4806(f)(2)) as a review by an agency
official who does not directly or indirectly report to the agency official who made the material supervisory determination
under review. In addition, this Act defines ``material supervisory determinations'' in section 309(f)(1) (12 U.S.C.
4806(f)(1)) to include determinations relating to (1) examination ratings, (2) the adequacy of loan loss reserve
provisions, and (3) loan classifications on loans that are significant to an institution. This definition expressly
excludes determinations to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured depository institution or a decision
to take prompt corrective action pursuant to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) (12 U.S.C. 1831o).

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In addition, section 309(g) (12 U.S.C. 4806(g)) expressly provides that the Act's requirement to establish an appeals
process does not affect the authority of the banking agencies to take enforcement or supervisory actions against
an institution. Finally, section 309(b) (12 U.S.C. 4906(b)) of the Act requires that appeals be heard and decided
expeditiously and that appropriate safeguards exist for protecting the appellant from retaliation by agency examiners.

Existing OCC Appeals Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC's existing procedures for national banks to appeal agency decisions and actions were published in Banking
Circular No. 272, dated June 11, 1993. These procedures have been modified and clarified in the proposed guidelines
to be consistent with the requirements of the Act. Until these guidelines are published in final form in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
, the current OCC appeals policy as set forth in Banking Circular No. 272 remains in effect. The OCC's appeals policy
does not supersede any existing appeals procedures available under current law.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC's appeals process provides that a national bank may file its appeal either with the District Administrator
or Deputy Comptroller of the OCC District in which the bank is headquartered (or the Deputy Comptroller for the appropriate
program in Washington, D.C. if the bank is a multinational bank or under special supervision), or directly with the
Ombudsman. The proposed guidelines clarify that the term national bank includes a Federal branch or agency of a foreign
bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller normally does not directly or indirectly participate in making
reviewable supervisory decisions nor report directly or indirectly to the agency official who made the reviewable
decision. In addition, the national bank may always file its appeal with the Ombudsman who is outside the bank supervision
area, reporting only to the Comptroller. Therefore, the OCC believes that its appeals process complies with the Act's
requirement that appeals be heard by an agency official who does not report directly or indirectly to the agency official
who made the material supervisory determination under review. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
However, to further assure that the appeals process remains completely independent, the OCC has added a provision
to require the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller to transfer an appeal to the Ombudsman if the District
Administrator or Deputy Comptroller directly or indirectly participated in making the decision under review or
reports directly or indirectly to the agency official who made the decision under review. In addition, the OCC has
added a provision to require the Ombudsman to transfer an appeal to the Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision
Policy if the Ombudsman should be recused from reviewing the decision under appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OCC also is proposing to extend the period of time in which the District Administrator, Deputy Comptroller, or
Ombudsman must make a decision on an appeal. Currently, the OCC's policy requires that the District Administrator
or the Deputy Comptroller, in the absence of any extenuating circumstances, issue a written response within 20 calendar
days of the filing of an appeal, and that the Ombudsman issue a written response within 30 calendar days of the filing
of an appeal. In addition, the Ombudsman must issue a written response to a second-tier appeal, which is an appeal by
a national bank of an appeal decision made by a District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller, within 15 calendar days
of the filing of that second-tier appeal. The OCC is proposing to extend the time period for deciding all first-tier
appeals to 45 days, and all second-tier appeals to 30 days. Based on the OCC's current experience with the appeals process,
it has found that some additional time may be necessary. The OCC believes that the time periods in the proposed guidelines
complies with the Act's requirement that an appeal be heard and decided expeditiously. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Act also requires that the appeals process contain appropriate safeguards for protecting the appellant from
retaliation by agency examiners. Currently, the OCC takes steps to ensure that banks are not unfairly treated because
of their appeal, although these steps are not part of the OCC's written appeals process. Specifically, the Ombudsman
makes periodic informal inquiries after a decision on an appeal is made to determine whether the bank believes the
OCC has taken action against it in retaliation for its appeal. If a bank indicates that such retaliatory action has
occurred, the Ombudsman initiates an investigation. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To ensure that these procedures are followed for each appeal, the OCC proposes to include the Ombudsman's follow-up-inquiries
in its guidelines. Specifically, the OCC proposes that the Ombudsman contact the appellant bank to inquire whether
the bank believes that OCC examiners have taken actions against it in retaliation for its appeal within (1) six months
after the date the Ombudsman, Deputy Administrator or Deputy Comptroller issues a final written response to an appeal,
and (2) six months after the date of completion of the first examination following an appeal. In addition, national
banks that believe they are the subject of retaliation because of their appeal may, at any time, seek redress with the
Ombudsman. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Finally, the OCC proposes to change its definition of appealable matters to expressly comply with the definition
of ``material supervisory determinations'' as provided in section 309(f)(1) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 4806(f)(1)).
The OCC's current process permits national banks to seek review of all agency decisions and actions except those involving
the appointment of receivers and conservators. Also expressly excluded are preliminary examination conclusions
communicated to the national bank prior to the issuance of either a Final Report of Examination or other written communication
from the OCC. The OCC believes that, until these preliminary conclusions become final, they are not ``material supervisory
determinations'' for purposes of the appellate procedures. Also, consistent with the Act, the OCC proposes to continue
to exclude enforcement-related actions or decisions from actions covered by the guidelines. The OCC proposes to
clarify that enforcement-related actions include decisions to take prompt corrective action pursuant to section
38 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o) and, thus, are not appealable under these guidelines. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be consistent with the Act, the OCC proposes to add the definition of ``material supervisory determination'' to
its discussion of appealable matters. The OCC appeals policy still includes decisions and actions in addition to
those specifically identified by the Act as material supervisory determinations, unless otherwise excluded.

Issues for Comment 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC requests comments on all aspects of its appeals process. In particular, the OCC requests comments on the following
issues: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. Do the guidelines adequately provide independence in the appeals process? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. Do the guidelines adequately provide that appeals are heard and decided expeditiously? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. Do the guidelines adequately protect appellant banks from retaliation by OCC examiners? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
4. Is the scope of appealable matters appropriate? 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
5. To what extent should the Ombudsman be bound by existing OCC policies?

National Bank Appeals Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The following is the OCC's Proposed Appeals Process: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
I. Policy 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The OCC is responsible for fostering the safety and soundness of the national banking system, monitoring, and enforcing
national banks' compliance with laws, and encouraging competitiveness, integrity, and stability of financial
services. In fulfilling this mission, it is the OCC's policy to maintain open and ongoing communication with the institutions
it supervises and to foster the fair and equitable administration of the supervisory process. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If a disagreement arises during the supervisory process, the OCC will resolve the dispute fairly and expeditiously
in an informal, amicable manner. If disagreements cannot be resolved through informal discussions, national banks
and Federal branches and agencies of foreign banks (collectively referred to as ``national banks'' for purposes
of these guidelines) are encouraged, and the examiner involved in the dispute should specifically encourage the
national bank, to seek a further review of the OCC decisions or actions that are in dispute. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
These guidelines establish a mechanism through which a national bank can seek such a review. A critical element in
this appeals process is the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman is outside the bank supervision area and reports directly to
the Comptroller of the Currency. With the prior consent of the Comptroller, the Ombudsman may supersede any agency
decision or action during the resolution of an appealable matter. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The procedures established in these guidelines provide national banks a fair and expeditious review of agency decisions
and actions while ensuring that no one is disadvantaged by the filing of an appeal. If a national bank has a question
as to whether it should make use of this appeal authority, it should contact the Ombudsman. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
II. Procedures 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Filing An Appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
A national bank may seek review of appealable matters by filing an appeal with either its immediate supervisory office
or with the OCC's Ombudsman. All communications with the Ombudsman may be sent to 1000 Louisiana Street, Suite 950,
Houston, Texas 77002&hyph;5008. The choice of where to file is a matter within the sole discretion of the bank, except
as indicated below; all appealable matters can be received in either location. However, in cases where the District
Administrator or Deputy Comptroller directly or indirectly participated in making the decision under review or
directly or indirectly reports to the agency official who made the decision under review, the District Administrator
or Deputy Comptroller must transfer the appeal to the Ombudsman. In addition, in cases where the Ombudsman should
be recused from reviewing the decision under appeal, the Ombudsman shall transfer the appeal to the Senior Deputy
Comptroller for Bank Supervision Policy in the OCC's Washington DC Office. The procedures for filing an appeal under
the two options are outlined below. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
1. Supervisory Office Appeals.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 If a disagreement concerning an OCC supervisory decision or action cannot be resolved informally, a national bank
may file an appeal with its immediate supervisory office. Community banks and regional banks seeking appeal under
this option should file such appeals with the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller of the OCC District in
which the bank is headquartered. Banks in the Multinational Banking or Special Supervision programs using this option
should file appeals with the Deputy Comptroller for the program in the Washington Office. In cases where the District
Administrator or Deputy Comptroller directly or indirectly participated in making the decision under review or
directly or indirectly reports to the agency official who made the decision under review, the District Administrator
or Deputy Comptroller must transfer the appeal to the Ombudsman after advising the appellant. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An appellant national banks must submit information in writing fully describing the matter in dispute and setting
forth its basis for requesting an appeal. Upon receipt of an appeal, the appropriate District Administrator or Deputy
Comptroller, or a designee who has not directly or indirectly participated in making the decision in dispute nor is
directly or indirectly responsible to the agency official who made the decision under review, will contact the OCC
employee(s) involved in the matter under appeal. The OCC employee(s) shall submit written or oral information concerning
the basis of the appeal. If requested by a senior official of the national bank filing the appeal, the appropriate District
Administrator or Deputy Comptroller shall arrange a meeting or a telephone call to more fully discuss the appeal and
related issues. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
In the absence of any extenuating circumstances, the appropriate District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller
shall issue a written response within 45 calendar days of the filing of the appeal. Immediately after the response
is issued, the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller shall forward to the Ombudsman copies of all relevant
materials considered in the preparation of the response, including all written submissions by the bank. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the national bank disagrees with the response from the District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller, a senior
official of the bank may further appeal the matter to the Ombudsman. The bank must file written notice of this second-tier
appeal within 15 calendar days of receiving the response from the appropriate District Administrator or Deputy Comptroller.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
After receipt of a second-tier appeal, the Ombudsman shall review all materials considered by the appropriate District
Administrator or Deputy Comptroller in the preparation of the initial response. The Ombudsman shall contact the
national bank to ensure that the OCC is in possession of all relevant materials. If requested by either OCC management
involved in the dispute or a senior official of the national bank filing the appeal, the Ombudsman shall arrange a meeting
or a telephone call to more fully discuss the appeal and related issues. In the absence of any extenuating circumstances,
the Ombudsman shall issue a written response to the second-tier appeal within 30 calendar days of the filing of that
appeal. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
2. Appeals to the Ombudsman
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 When disagreements concerning OCC supervisory decisions and actions cannot be resolved informally and a national
bank chooses not to file an appeal with its immediate supervisory office, a national bank may file an appeal directly
with the Ombudsman. In cases where the Ombudsman should be recused from reviewing the decision under appeal, the Ombudsman
shall transfer the appeal to the Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision Policy in the OCC's Washington DC
office. In such cases, the procedures outlined below will apply.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
National banks filing appeals with the Ombudsman must submit information in writing fully describing the matter
in dispute. After receipt of an appeal, the Ombudsman shall contact the OCC management official involved in the dispute.
That management official shall submit written materials and relevant OCC documents pertaining to the bases of the
appeal within 10 calendar days of the notice from the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman shall contact the national bank to ensure
that the OCC is in possession of all relevant materials. If requested by either OCC management involved in the dispute
or a senior official of the national bank filing the appeal, the Ombudsman shall arrange a meeting or a telephone call
to more fully discuss the appeal and related issues. In the absence of any extenuating circumstances, the Ombudsman
shall issue a written response to the appeal within 45 calendar days of the filing of the appeal by a national bank.

B. Follow-up by Ombudsman 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
After the Ombudsman receives a decision on an appeal, the Ombudsman shall contact every appellant bank to inquire
whether the bank believes OCC examiners have taken actions against the bank in retaliation for its appeal. The Ombudsman
shall make these contacts (1) six months after the date the Ombudsman, Deputy Administrator or Deputy Comptroller
issues a final written response to an appeal, and (2) six months after the date of completion of the first examination
of the appellant bank following its appeal. A national bank may, of course, contact the Ombudsman at any time during
or after the appeal if the bank reasonably believes that an OCC examiner is taking action against it in retaliation
for its appeal. Upon identifying or learning of any possible retaliatory actions, the Ombudsman shall investigate
the complaint; such investigations must be completed within 30 days. If the Ombudsman determines that retaliation
has occurred, the Ombudsman shall forward the complaint to the District Administrator, Deputy Comptroller, or Inspector
General for appropriate action.

C. Appealable Matters 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Except as otherwise provided, a national bank may seek a review of any agency decision or action, including a material
supervisory determination. A material supervisory determination includes a determination relating to: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Examination ratings; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;The adequacy of loan loss reserve provisions; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Loan classifications on loans that are significant to an institution. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
A national bank may not appeal: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Appointments of receivers and conservators; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Preliminary examination conclusions communicated to the national bank prior to the issuance of either a final
Report of Examination or other written communication from the OCC; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
&bull;Enforcement-related actions or decisions, including decisions to take prompt corrective action pursuant
to section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. &sect;1831o). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
An enforcement-related action or decision commences, and therefore becomes unappealable, when the national bank
receives notice from the OCC indicating its intention to pursue available remedies under applicable statutes or
published enforcement-related policies of the OCC. Such policies include OCC's Policy for Corrective Action (PPM
5310&hyph;3)(REV), Civil Money Penalty Policy (PPM 5000&hyph;7)(REV), and Securities Enforcement Policy (PPM
5310&hyph;5). These policies are available on request from the OCC's Communications Division, 250 E. Street, SW.,
Washington DC 20219&hyph;0001, 202&hyph;874&hyph;4700. For purposes of these guidelines only, remarks in a Report
of Examination do not constitute notice of intent to pursue enforcement remedies. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The appeals process established by these guidelines does not supersede any existing appeals procedures available
under current law. Matters which are subject to an existing appeals process designed specifically for the issue in
dispute, such as re-review of Shared National Credit findings (Banking Circular 189), and reconsideration of decisions
on corporate applications (12 CFR 5.13(d)), are appealable to the Ombudsman when the agency decision is final under
the specifically designed procedures.

III. Effect of Filing An Appeal 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a general rule, the filing of an appeal with either the national bank's immediate supervisory office or with the
Ombudsman serves to stay all agency decisions and actions until the appeal is resolved. In the appropriate circumstances,
however, the Ombudsman may put the disputed agency decision or action into effect while the appeal is still pending.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
 The primary purpose of consultation is to provide information and to discuss options available to the Department
of the Interior under the NPR, the Federal Workplace Restructuring Act, and other reorganization or downsizing directives.
A packet of information for the January meetings will be distributed to Federally recognized Indian Tribes by the
Bureau area office local contact person. The packets will also be available at each meeting. Some of the parameters
imposed by the Office of Management and Budget and the Department of the Interior have been set forth in a tribal leader
letter which was issued on November 10, 1994. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Written comments should be mailed in sufficient time to be received on or before January 31, 1995, to the Bureau of Indian
Affairs, Office of the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs, MS&hyph;4160&hyph;MIB, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20240, Attn: Diane Maybee. Written comments may be hand delivered to Room 4658 at the same address. Comments may
also be telefaxed to the BIA at (202) 208&hyph;3575. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Following the consultation, the Bureau will finalize its streamlining implementation plan which incorporates
the consultation comments, the mandates of the Office of Management and Budget, as well as the Department of the Interior
and the Congress. To the extent feasible and under the constraints of existing federal mandates to downsize and streamline,
the BIA will make a good faith effort to integrate and incorporate tribal concerns and recommendations into the final
implementation plan which must be submitted to the Department of the Interior by February 28, 1995. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Travel to the consultation sessions will be paid by the tribal participants.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Pursuant to 25 CFR 83.10(h), notice is hereby given that the Assistant Secretary proposes to decline to acknowledge
that the United Houma Nation, Inc. c/o Mrs. Laura N. Billiot, Star Route, Box 95&hyph;A, Golden Meadow, Louisiana
70357, exists as an Indian tribe within the meaning of Federal law. This notice is based on a determination that the
tribe does not meet three of the seven mandatory criteria set forth in 25 CFR 83.7. Therefore, the United Houma Nation
does not meet the requirements necessary for a government-to-government relationship with the United States.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
This notice is published in the exercise of authority delegated by the Secretary of the Interior to the Assistant Secretary_Indian
Affairs by 209 DM 8.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The petitioner maintains that they are the descendants of the historical Houma Indian tribe. There is no evidence
supporting this contention. The historical Houma Indian tribe continued to live near present-day Donaldsonville,
Louisiana throughout the years the petitioner's antecedent community first formed on the lower bayous (between
1810 and 1830). There are no documented genealogical, social, or political connections between this tribe of Indians
and the petitioner. There is also no evidence that the petitioner, as a group, descends from any other historical tribe,
or from historical tribes which combined and functioned as a single autonomous entity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is no evidence that the petitioner's ancestors constituted a social community, Indian or non-Indian, before
1830. Because of this, the petitioner has also failed to meet criterion 83.7(b), maintenance of social community,
and criterion 83.7(c), exercise of political influence, prior to 1830. Lacking the evidence for an ancestral community
prior to 1830, there is, of course, no evidence for the exercise of political influence prior to 1830. The Federal acknowledgment
criteria 83.7 (b) and (c) require the petitioner to provide evidence that they fulfill criteria 83.7 (b) and (c)
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
 from the time of first sustained contact with Europeans 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
to the present.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The migration of the UHN ancestors, the majority of whom were non-Indian (primarily French, Acadian, German, and
African) frontiersmen, to the founding Bayou Terrebonne settlement (north of present-day Montegut) started in
the 1790's. Among the settlers on Bayou Terrebonne, some of whom became ancestors of the UHN, were the three Indian
progenitors of the group. They moved there independently of each other; there is no indication that they were related
to each other socially, politically, or genealogically, before moving to the bayou settlement. The tribal affiliation
of the three Indian progenitors is not certain. One was quite possibly a Biloxi medal chief; the other two are identified
in the earliest historical records only as ``Indian women,'' with no specific tribal affiliation mentioned. There
is no evidence that these three individuals descend from the same historical tribe or from historical tribes which
combined and functioned as a single autonomous entity.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is important to note that, for the first two generations that the founding UHN community was forming on Bayou Terrebonne
(1790 to 1830), the petitioner's Indian ancestors and their descendants tended to marry non-Indians. In spite of
this early marital pattern, and the fact that there are more non-Indian than Indian progenitors for the petitioner,
the available evidence indicates that about 84% of the UHN's current members have Indian ancestry. The Indian ancestry
originates from the three individual Indian progenitors mentioned above, the result of six generations of group
endogamy between 1830 to 1950. It is not the result of descent, as a group, from a historical tribe.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By 1830, the petitioner's ancestors, the majority of whom were non-Indian, formed an identifiable separate and distinct
community on Bayou Terrebonne. From 1830 to 1940, the limited evidence submitted by the petitioner indicates that
they tended to marry each other more frequently than they married outsiders. The strongest evidence for social community
from 1830 to 1880, however, is that more than half of the petitioner's ancestors lived in an isolated, exclusive settlement.

In the 1840's, the petitioner's ancestors started forming satellite settlements further south along Bayou Terrebonne,
on Bayou Lafourche, and on other bayous toward the west. No contemporary descriptions of the petitioner's settlements
between 1840 and 1880 were found. But based on the geographical isolation of the community on Bayou Terrebonne, we
conclude that the petitioner did maintain a distinct settlement which encompassed 50% or more of its members, from
1830 to 1880. Under the revised regulations for Federal acknowledgment, this is considered sufficient evidence
that the petitioner meets both criteria 83.7 (b) and (c) for that period as a single community. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
By 1880, the limited evidence presented by the petitioner suggests that its members' ancestors had divided into several
(six or more), socially and politically distinct, satellite communities, and no longer lived in a single community.
From 1880 to 1940, the petitioner's ancestors maintained social integrity in these satellite communities, based
on the evidence that 50% or more of them lived in geographical isolation. Within these relatively isolated communities,
there is some limited evidence that political influence was exercised through the extended kinship structure, by
elders known as 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
noncs
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 `uncles' and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
tantes
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 `aunts'. This system of political influence may have been used effectively to control the behavior of individual
community members, though the evidence is limited and sketchy.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From 1880 to 1940, there were some individuals who provided leadership on an 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
ad hoc
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 basis for individual communities, but never for the petitioner as a whole. One of the issues that brought forth leaders
was in the fight to establish separate Indian schools for the children of UHN ancestors. Because the petitioner appears
to have been composed of separate communities from 1880 to 1940, each of which may have had its own leaders, rather than
a single community with a comprehensive authority, the petitioner has not met criteria 83.7 (b) and (c) from 1880 to
1940, as a whole.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
From 1940 to the present, the petitioner's members have emigrated from the lower bayou communities in greater numbers,
especially to the suburbs of New Orleans. There has also been a continuous increase in out-marriage from 1940 to the
present. Currently, two-thirds of the UHN members reside outside of the lower bayou communities. There is no evidence
that indicates a social or political relationship between those who have emigrated and those who continue to reside
in the bayou communities. There is also no evidence that the emigrants are related socially or politically among themselves.
There is some limited evidence that emigrants from specific bayou communities may maintain political and social
relations with relatives who remain in their natal bayou communities. Therefore, the petitioner has not met criteria
83.7 (b) and (c) from 1940 to the present as a whole.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioner has not proven that it descends from a historical Indian tribe. In fact, there is no evidence for an antecedent
community, Indian or non-Indian, prior to 1830. Since the UHN did not exist as a community until 1830, they are not a
political community which is derived from a tribe existing at first sustained contact with Europeans until the present,
and have not existed as a distinct political community derived from such a tribe since first settlement by Europeans
in the area.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
There is the possibility, though not well-documented at this time, that some or all of the component communities on
the lower bayous may meet criteria 83.7 (b) and (c) from 1880 to the present, as separate communities. But the petitioner
has not established any connection to a historical tribe prior to 1830. Nor did the petitioner submit its petition
as a confederation, but rather as a single entity. For these combined reasons, there is no need to further evaluate
the continued existence of separate communities from 1880 to the present, at this time.

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
There remains the possibility, however, that if the required connection is made to a historical tribe, the Assistant
Secretary may wish to investigate further the possibility of acknowledging all or several of the component communities
that comprise the UHN. This issue would only need to be investigated if the connection to a historical tribe is proven.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Since 1900, the petitioner's community has been identified consistently by anthropologists, state and Federal
government representatives, residents of south Louisiana who are not members of the petitioning group, missionaries,
journalists, and others, as ``Indian'' or by other terms which indicate at least some Indian ancestry. There is no
evidence that anyone denied that the UHN were an Indian community since 1900. They therefore meet criterion 83.7(a),
identification by outsiders as an Indian community since 1900. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The petitioning group has provided a copy of its governing document, which describes its membership criteria. Evidence
indicates that the group is following its membership criteria satisfactorily. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No evidence was found that any of the members of the UHN are members of any federally recognized tribe. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
No evidence was found that the petitioner or its members are the subject of congressional legislation which has expressly
terminated or forbidden the Federal relationship. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Based on this preliminary factual determination, we conclude that the UHN does not meet criteria b, c, and e in 25 CFR
83.7. Since the UHN does not meet all of the seven mandatory criteria, we conclude that the UHN should not be granted
Federal acknowledgment under 25 CFR part 83. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
As provided by 25 CFR 83.10(h) of the revised regulations, a report summarizing the evidence, reasoning, and analyses
that are the basis for the proposed decision will be provided to the petitioner and other interested parties, and is
available to other parties upon written request. Comments on the proposed finding and/or requests for a copy of the

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
This competition is authorized under the Community Outreach Partnership Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 5307 note; hereafter
referred to as the ``COPC Act''). The COPC Act is contained in section 851 of the Housing and Community Development
Act of 1992 (P.L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (HCD Act of 1992). Section 801(c) of the HCD Act of 1992 authorizes
$7.5 million for each year of the 5-year demonstration to create Community outreach Partnership Centers as authorized
in the COPC Act. The Act also required HUD to establish a national clearinghouse to disseminate information about
the program. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The Community Outreach Partnership Centers program was transferred to the Office of Policy Development and Research
on August 15, 1994, as part of the Departmental reorganization which created the Office of University Partnerships.
This new Office is responsible for four of the Department's grant programs for institutions of higher education_Community
Outreach Partnership Centers program, Joint Community Development program, Community Development Work Study
program, and the Doctoral Dissertation Grant program. In addition, the Office is responsible for a variety of new

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The competition in this NOFA is for $7.125 million to fund the second year of the Community Outreach Partnership Centers
(COPC) Program authorized as indicated above. HUD has made $7.5 million available for the program for FY 1995. $210,000
has been taken off the top to correct a mathematical error in the funding of one of last year's grantees and $165,000
has been taken off the top to fund the clearinghouse in FY 1995. Thus, $7.125 million is available under this NOFA.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
Each grant made under the COPC program will be for a maximum two year period of performance. The maximum size of any grant
will be $750,000, while the minimum will be $250,000. HUD has the authority to reduce the grant amount. Several applications
were disqualified last year because they exceeded the maximum amount. Each applicant must submit an application
within this range. Institutions of higher education which received COPC grants in FY 1994 are not eligible to receive
another COPC grant under this funding round.

C. Description of Competition 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 -->
The Congress has mandated that the Department carry out ``a 5-year demonstration to determine the feasibility of
facilitating partnerships between institutions of higher education and communities to solve urban problems through
research, outreach and the exchange of information.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The COPC Act stipulates that grants are to go to public and private institutions of higher education to establish and
operate Community Outreach Partnership Centers (COPC). These COPCs shall: ``(A) Conduct competent and qualified
research and investigation on theoretical or practical problems in large and small cities; and (B) Facilitate partnerships
and outreach activities between institutions of higher education, local communities, and local governments to
address urban problems.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The specific problems that grants under the COPC program must focus on are ``problems associated with housing, economic
development, neighborhood revitalization, infrastructure, health care, job training, education, crime prevention,
planning, community organizing, and other areas deemed appropriate by the Secretary.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Furthermore, the COPC Act states: ``The Secretary shall give preference to institutions of higher education that
undertake research and outreach activities by bringing together knowledge and expertise in the various disciplines
that relate to urban problems.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Local COPC programs must combine research with outreach, work with communities and local governments and address
the multi-dimensional problems that beset urban areas. The Department is mindful that, for some institutions, such
a comprehensive approach may be beyond the current capacity of the institution. Because HUD is interested in funding
as wide a range of eligible institutions as possible, it is making a change in the focus of the program. This year applications
do not have to be comprehensive in their approach to local problems. However, while single purpose applications (e.g.,
assisting the homeless, small business development) will not be eligible, a less than comprehensive scope, addressing
three or more urban problems will be acceptable (see Selection Factor 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 -->
#
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
1 for the comprehensive list of urban problems that the program can cover). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
To be most effective during the term of the demonstration, the assisted research must have a clear near-term potential
for solving specific, significant urban problems. The selected institutions must have the capacity to apply their
research results and to work with communities and local institutions, including neighborhood groups, in applying
these results to specific real-life urban problems. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
D. Eligible Applicants 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants for this competition must be public or private nonprofit institutions of higher education granting four
year degrees and accredited by a national or regional accrediting agency recognized by the Department of Education.
Consortia of institutions are eligible to apply. The Department is interested in expanding the outreach capacity
of not only colleges and universities but also junior, technical, and community colleges. While some four-year colleges
will want to apply directly for a COPC, others may not feel they have the credentials or the capacity to operate a COPC.
Two-year colleges by themselves are not eligible, but they can apply with a school offering a four-year program. But
both four-year and two-year colleges by themselves have strengths they could bring to a COPC. Thus, a selection factor
has been added to encourage the creation of such consortia. If the application is submitted on behalf of a consortium
of institutions, one institution must be designated as the legal applicant. Each institution may be part of only one
consortium or submit only one application, although the application can include various schools within the institution.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
While the program focuses on ``urban'' problems, applicants do not have to be located in or assist urban areas.

E. Program Requirements 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grantees must meet the following program requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
1. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Responsibilities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with section 851(h) of the HCD Act of 1992, each COPC shall: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
``(a) Employ the research and outreach resources of its sponsoring institution of higher education to solve specific
urban problems identified by communities served by the Center; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Establish outreach activities in areas identified in the grant application as the communities to be served; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) Establish a community advisory committee comprised of representatives of local institutions and residents
of the communities to be served to assist in identifying local needs and advise on the development and implementation
of strategies to address those issues; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(d) Coordinate outreach activities in communities to be served by the Center; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(e) Facilitate public service projects in the communities served by the Center; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(f) Act as a clearinghouse for dissemination of information; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(g) Develop instructional programs, convene conferences, and provide training for local community leaders, when
appropriate; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(h) Exchange information with other Centers.'' 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The clearinghouse function in (f) above refers to a local or regional clearinghouse for dissemination of information
and is separate and distinct from the functions in (h) above, which relate to the provision of information to the National
Clearinghouse which, as mentioned in section I.A. above will serve all funded COPCs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
2. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Match. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Grantees must meet the following match requirements: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Research Activities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
50 percent of the total project costs of establishing and operating research activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Outreach Activities. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
25 percent of the total project costs of establishing and operating outreach activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This non-Federal share may include cash or the value of non-cash contributions, equipment and other allowable in-kind
contributions as detailed in Attachment E of OMB Circular No. A&hyph;110, Grants and Agreements with Institutions
of Higher Education, Hospitals, and other Nonprofit organizations. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Because there was confusion last year about the calculation of the match, an example is provided. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Assume that the total project cost for a COPC was $1 million, with $250,000 for research and $750,000 for outreach.
Note that this project meets the requirement that no more than 25 percent of the total project costs be for research.
The total amount of the match required to be provided would be $312,500. The research match would be $125,000 ($250,000
X 50 percent) and the outreach match would be $187,500 ($750,000 X 25 percent). The Federal grant requested would be
$687,500 ($1 million minus the match of $312,500). In calculating the match, administrative costs should be applied
to the appropriate attributable outreach or research component. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
3. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Administrative.

II. Selection Criteria/Rating Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
A. Rating Factors 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
As a result of a year of experience under the program, the Department has decided to streamline and revise the selection
criteria. Changes are noted in the discussion of specific factors. HUD will use the following criteria to rate and
rank applications received in response to this NOFA. The factors and maximum points for each factor are provided below.
The maximum number of points is 100. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Rating of the ``applicant'' or the ``applicant's organization and staff'', unless otherwise specified, will include
any sub-contractors, consultants and sub-recipients which are firmly committed to the project. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) (10 points) The demonstrated research and outreach resources available to the applicant for carrying out the
purposes of the COPC Act. In rating this factor, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant's organization
and staff have recent, relevant and successful experience in:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) Undertaking research activities in specific communities which have clear near-term potential for practical
application to significant urban problems associated with housing, economic development, neighborhood revitalization,
infrastructure, health care, job training, education, crime prevention, planning and community organizing, and

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Undertaking outreach activities in specific communities to solve or ameliorate the impact of significant urban
problems. Under this factor, HUD will also evaluate the capability of the applicant to provide leadership in solving
community problems and in making national contributions to solving long-term and immediate urban problems. In the
FY 1994 competition, research and outreach resources and local and national prominence were three separate selection
factors. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(2) (10 points) The demonstrated commitment of the applicant to supporting research and outreach programs by providing
matching contributions for the Federal assistance received. In rating this factor, HUD will provide an increasing
number of points for increasing amounts of contributions beyond the statutory 50 percent for research and 25 percent
for outreach. Maximum points will be awarded for applications that secure 50 percent more than the amount of match
required. Points will also be awarded based on the tangibility of the match, with cash and services being rated higher
than indirect contributions. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(3) (10 points) The extent of need in the communities to be served by the applicant. HUD will consider the extent to which
the proposal clearly delineates a need or needs in the specific communities or neighborhoods (including colonias,
where appropriate), that can be resolved through the activities of a COPC. The applicant must demonstrate how these
needs were determined and how the COPC will help resolve these needs.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(4) (10 points) The demonstrated ability of the applicant to disseminate results of research and successful strategies
developed through outreach activities to other COPC and communities served through this demonstration program.
In rating this factor, HUD will evaluate the past experience of the applicant's staff and the scope and the quality
of the applicant's proposal to disseminate information on its own and other COPC research results and strategies
to: (a) local communities in its area and (b) other communities and COPC through the National Clearinghouse. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(5) (35 points) The projects and activities that the applicant proposes to carry out under the grant. This factor has
two sub-factors: (a) effectiveness of the research strategy (10 points), and (b) effectiveness of the outreach strategy
(25 points). 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) In rating the effectiveness of the research strategy, HUD will consider the extent to which the applicant's proposal
outlines a clear research agenda related to local needs that can be successfully carried out within the period of this
grant; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) Demonstrates how the research to be undertaken will fit into the outreach strategy and activities. In rating the
effectiveness of the outreach factor, HUD will consider the extent to which: 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(i) The application identifies a clear outreach agenda related to locally-identified needs that can be successfully
carried out within the period of this grant; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(ii) The outreach agenda includes design of a community strategy to resolve community and neighborhood problems;
and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(iii) The outreach program provides for on-site or a frequent presence in the communities and neighborhoods to be
assisted through outreach activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(6) (10 points) The extent of neighborhood and neighborhood based organization participation in the planning and
implementation of the COPC. In rating this factor, HUD will consider whether:

<!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
(a) One or more effective community advisory committees comprised of representatives of local institutions and
a balance of racial/ethnic, gender and income mix of residents of the communities (and, where appropriate, colonias)
to be served has been or will be formed to participate in identifying local needs to be addressed by the COPC and to form
a partnership with the COPC to develop and implement strategies to address those needs; 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) There is a plan for involving the community advisory committee(s) in the execution of the research and outreach
agenda; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(c) The outreach agenda includes training projects for local community leaders, when appropriate. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(7) (5 points) The application is submitted by a consortium composed of a variety of different kinds of post-secondary
institutions. Maximum points will be awarded to consortia composed of universities, colleges and junior, technical
or community colleges. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(8) (10 points) The overall concept and organization of the application. In rating this factor, HUD will consider:

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(a) The interrelatedness of the components of the application, such as the relationship of the research capacity
to dissemination and outreach activities; and 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(b) The likelihood that the project can be initiated and completed within the two year grant period, as measured by
such elements as sufficient staff, realistic schedules, the quality of supervision and project management, and
the likelihood that other related commitments essential to the project will be in place. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
B. Selection Process 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applications for funding under this NOFA will be evaluated competitively and points will be awarded as specified
in the Rating Factors section described above. Applications will be reviewed by a combination of external peers and
internal reviewers. After assigning points based upon the factors all applications will be listed in rank order.
Applications will then be funded in rank order until all available funds have been expended. However, in order to be
funded, an applicant must receive a minimum score of 70. HUD reserves the right to fund all or portions of the proposed
activities identified in each application, based upon the eligibility of the proposed activities. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If two or more applications have the same number of points, the application with the most points for rating factor (6)
shall be selected. If there is still a tie, the application with the most points for rating factor (7) shall be selected.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If the amount of funds remaining after funding as many of the highest ranking applications as possible is insufficient
for the next highest ranking application, HUD shall determine (based upon the proposed activities) if it is feasible
to fund part of the application and offer a smaller grant to the applicant. If HUD determines that given the proposed
activities a smaller grant amount would make the activities infeasible, or if the applicant turns down the reduced
grant amount, HUD shall make the same determination for the next highest ranking application until all applications
with scores of at least 70 points or available funds have been exhausted. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
If HUD receives an insufficient number of applications to exhaust all funds, or if funds remain after HUD approves
all approvable applications, HUD may negotiate increased amounts of grant awards up to an additional $250,000. Increased
grants will be offered in rank order to applicants with scores of at least 70 points. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
C. Geographic Distribution 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD reserves the right to make selections out of rank order to provide for a geographic distribution of funded COPCs.
The geographic balance that HUD will use, if it decides to implement this option, will be based on a combination of two
adjacent standard HUD regions (e.g., Southwest and Southeast Regions, Great Plains and Midwest Regions, etc.).
If the rank order does not yield at least one fundable COPC within each two region combination, then HUD may select the
highest ranking application from such a combination, as long as the minimum score of 70 is achieved. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
It is HUD's intent to fund at least one COPC that serves the colonias, as defined by Section 916(d) of the Cranston-Gonzalez
National Affordable Housing Act, as long as the applicant receives a minimum score of 70.

After the submission deadline date, HUD will screen each application to determine whether it is complete. If an application
lacks certain technical items or contains a technical error, such as an incorrect signatory, HUD will notify the applicant
in writing that it has 14 calendar days from the date of HUD's written notification to cure the technical deficiency.
If the applicant fails to submit the missing material within the 14-day cure period, HUD will disqualify the application.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
This 14-day cure period applies only to non-substantive deficiencies or errors. Any deficiency capable of cure will
involve only items not necessary for HUD to assess the merits of an application against the factors specified in this
NOFA.

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
In accordance with 40 CFR 1508.4 of the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality and 24 CFR 50.20(b) of the
HUD regulations, the policies and procedures in this document relate only to the provision of research, training
and technical assistance which do not result in physical change and therefore are categorically excluded from the
requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act.

Federalism Impact 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Federalism, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has determined that the policies and procedures contained in this notice will not have substantial direct effects
on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the federal government and the states, or
on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the notice
is not subject to review under the Order. Specifically, the notice solicits participation in an effort to provide
assistance to institutions of higher education for establishing and carrying out research and outreach activities
addressing the problems of urban areas. The COPCs established under this notice will work with local communities
to help resolve urban problems. The notice does not impinge upon the relationships between the Federal government
and State or local governments.

The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
The Family, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
has determined that this notice will likely have a beneficial impact on family formation, maintenance, and general
well-being. The assistance to be provided by the funding under this NOFA is expected to help local residents to become
self-sufficient by improving living conditions and standards. Accordingly, since the impact on the family is beneficial,
no further review is considered necessary.

Documentation and Public Access Requirements: HUD Reform Act 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this
NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including
any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than
30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information
Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients
of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->
Federal Register
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the
notice published in the 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->

Prohibition Against Advance Information on Funding Decisions 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the HUD Reform Act is codified at 24 CFR part 4, and applies to this funding
competition. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection of successful
applicants. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are restrained by part
4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding
decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance
in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815. (This is not a toll-free
number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. However, a HUD
employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with persons
outside the Department, should contact his or her Field counsel, or Headquarters counsel for the program to which
the question pertains. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Prohibition Against Lobbying of HUD Personnel 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3537b) contains two provisions dealing
with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements
on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the
taking of a management action by the Department 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
and 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence
the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of
assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The rule implementing section is codified at 24 CFR part 86. If readers are involved in any efforts to influence the
Department in these ways, they are urged to read part 86, particularly the examples contained in Appendix A of the regulation.

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Any questions about the rule should be directed to the Office of Ethics, Room 2158, Department of Housing and Urban
Development, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410&hyph;3000. Telephone: (202) 708&hyph;3815 TDD: (202)
708&hyph;1112. These are not toll-free numbers. Forms necessary for compliance with the rule may be obtained from
the local HUD office. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->
Prohibition Against Lobbying Activities 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The use of funds awarded under this NOFA is subject to the disclosure requirements and prohibitions of Section 319
of the Department of Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1990 (31 U.S.C. 1352) and the
implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 87. These authorities prohibit recipients of federal contracts, grants,
or loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government
in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The prohibition also covers the awarding of contracts, grants,
cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying.
Under 24 CFR part 87, applicants, recipients, and subrecipients of assistance exceeding $100,000 must certify that
no federal funds have been or will be spent on lobbying activities in connection with the assistance.

Protection of Human Subjects 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
45 CFR, part 46, Subtitle A on the protection of human subjects does not apply to the COPC program because the research
activities to be conducted under the program are only incidentally regulated by the Department solely as part of it's
broader responsibility to regulate certain types of activities whether research or non-research in nature.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
Title XX of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. 300z, 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
et seq., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants for demonstration projects to provide services
to pregnant and nonpregnant adolescents, adolescent parents and their families. (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance
Number 93.995) Title XX authorizes grants for three types of demonstration projects: (1) Projects which provide
``care services'' only (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
services for the provision of care to pregnant adolescents, adolescent parents and their families); (2) projects
which provide ``prevention services'' only (
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->
i.e., 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->
services to prevent adolescent sexual relations); and (3) projects which provide a combination of care and prevention
services. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
The Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs (OAPP) intends to make available approximately $4.5 million to support
an estimated 10&hyph;15 new demonstration projects. An applicant may submit a proposal for a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
local 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
care, prevention or combination care/prevention project 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
or 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
for a 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
national multi-site 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
prevention project with at least two sites in different States. The awards for care projects will range from $200,000
to $400,000. The awards for local prevention projects will range from $150,000 to $250,000. Funding for national
multi-site prevention projects and for combination care/prevention projects may be higher, in proportion to the
effort proposed. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
These grants will be awarded for a period of one year, and the availability of funding for later years is uncertain.
Therefore, we encourage applications from experienced organizations which are currently operating programs and
which have the capability of expanding and enhancing these services to serve significant numbers of adolescents
according to the guidelines specified in this announcement. 
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Additional funds may be available in Fiscal Year 1996 and following years. If funds do become available, grantees
funded under this program announcement will be eligible to reapply for continued funding. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Grants are funded in annual increments (budget periods). Funding for all approved budget periods beyond the first
year of a grant is contingent upon the availability of funds, satisfactory progress of the project, and adequate stewardship
of Federal funds. A grant award may not exceed 70 percent of the total cost of the project for the first year. The non-Federal
share of the project costs may be provided in cash expenditures or fairly evaluated in-kind contributions, including
plant, equipment and services.

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this announcement, funds are available for local care demonstrations only and not for multi-site national

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Under the statute the purpose of care programs is to establish innovative, comprehensive, and integrated approaches
to the delivery of care services for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents under 19 years of age at program entry,
with primary emphasis on unmarried adolescents who are 17 years old or younger and for their families. This includes
young fathers and their families.

The OAPP encourages the submission of care applications which propose to do the following: (1) Add care services to
supplement existing adolescent health services in school, hospital or other community settings, (2) provide care

Prevention Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Under this announcement, funds are available for both local and national projects. A national project must have at
least two sites in different States.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The primary purpose of prevention programs is to find effective means of reaching adolescents, both male and female,
before they become sexually active in order to encourage them to abstain from sexual activity. There is general agreement
that early initiation of sexual activity brings not only the risk of unintended pregnancy but also substantial health
risks to adolescents, primarily infection with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV. Accordingly,
applicants must provide services that help pre-adolescents and young adolescents acquire knowledge and skills
that will instill healthy attitudes and encourage and support the postponement of early sexual activity. Such services
must also include the provision of medically accurate information relating to reducing the risk of unintended pregnancy
and disease for adolescents who may be or become sexually active.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->
Under this announcement, OAPP will not fund proposals to develop new prevention curricula.
<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
 Applicants must propose to use existing and available educational materials/curricula which are consistent with
this program announcement.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
The OAPP encourages the submission of prevention applications which propose to do the following: (1) Add prevention
services to supplement existing adolescent health education programs or health service programs in school or other
community settings, (2) provide prevention services to minority or other disadvantaged populations, (3) use curricula
which have been demonstrated and evaluated to be effective, (4) include medically accurate information on sexuality,
contraception, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS, (5) offer educational services to parents to
assist them in communicating with their children about sexuality, contraception, STDs and HIV/AIDS, and (6) involve
males and promote male responsibility.
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Applicants for prevention programs are not required to provide any specific array of services; a proposal may include
any one or more of the following services as appropriate:
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
(1) Educational services relating to family life and problems associated with adolescent premarital sexual relations
including:

Combination Care and Prevention Services Programs
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Applicants proposing to provide both care and prevention services must meet the requirements for both categories
as described above. They must also propose to make a substantial effort in each of the two areas and indicate clearly
in the application and budget the proportion of effort to be expanded in each component.

Evaluation
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG /ITAG -->

<!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->
Section 2006(b)(1) of Title XX requires each grantee to expend at least one percent but not more than five percent of
the Federal funds received under Title XX on evaluation of the project. As this is a demonstration program, all applications
are required to have an evaluation component of high quality consistent with the scope of the proposed project and
the funding level. All project evaluations should monitor program processes to determine whether the program has
been carried out as planned and measure the program's outcomes. Waivers of the five percent limit on evaluation (see
sec. 2006(b)(1)) may be granted in cases where a more rigorous or comprehensive evaluation effort is proposed. 
<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->

<!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->
Section 2006(b)(2) requires that an organization or an entity independent of the grantee providing services assist
the grantee in evaluating the project. The OAPP strongly recommends extensive collaboration between the applicant
organization and the proposed evaluator in the development of the intervention, development of the evaluation hypothesis(es),
identification of the variables to be measured and a timetable for initiation of the intervention, baseline measurement,
and ongoing evaluation data collection and analysis.
